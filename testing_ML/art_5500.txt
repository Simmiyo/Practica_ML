On the convergence of the Calabi flow
Suppose there is a constant scalar curvature metric on a compact Kahler
manifold without holomorphic vector field. We prove that the Calabi flow, if it
is assumed to exist for all time with bounded Ricci curvature, will converge to
the constant scalar curvature metric.
