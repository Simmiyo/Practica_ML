Monte Carlo Simulations of Globular Cluster Evolution. VI. The Influence
  of an Intermediate Mass Black Hole
We present results of a series of Monte Carlo simulations investigating the
imprint of a central intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) on the structure of a
globular cluster. We investigate the three-dimensional and projected density
profiles, and stellar disruption rates for idealized as well as realistic
cluster models, taking into account a stellar mass spectrum and stellar
evolution, and allowing for a larger, more realistic, number of stars than was
previously possible with direct N-body methods. We compare our results to other
N-body and Fokker-Planck simulations published previously. We find, in general,
very good agreement for the overall cluster structure and dynamical evolution
between direct N-body simulations and our Monte Carlo simulations. Significant
differences exist in the number of stars that are tidally disrupted by the
IMBH, which is most likely an effect of the wandering motion of the IMBH, not
included in the Monte Carlo scheme. These differences, however, are negligible
for the final IMBH masses in realistic cluster models as the disruption rates
are generally much lower than for single-mass clusters. As a direct comparison
to observations we construct a detailed model for the cluster NGC 5694, which
is known to possess a central surface brightness cusp consistent with the
presence of an IMBH. We find that not only the inner slope but also the outer
part of the surface brightness profile agree well with observations. However,
there is only a slight preference for models harboring an IMBH compared to
models without.
