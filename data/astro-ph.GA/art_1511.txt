Coordinated NIR/mm observations of flare emission from Sagittarius A*
We report on a successful, simultaneous observation and modelling of the
millimeter (mm) to near-infrared (NIR) flare emission of the Sgr A* counterpart
associated with the supermassive black hole at the Galactic centre (GC). We
present a mm/sub-mm light curve of Sgr A* with one of the highest quality
continuous time coverages and study and model the physical processes giving
rise to the variable emission of Sgr A*.
