Evidence of the inhomogeneity of the stellar population in the
  differentially reddened globular cluster NGC 3201
We report on evidence of the inhomogeneity (multiplicity) of the stellar
population in the Galactic globular cluster (GC) NGC 3201, which is irregularly
reddened across its face. We carried out a more detailed and careful analysis
of our recently published new multi-color photometry in a wide field of the
cluster with particular emphasis on the U band. Using the photometric data
corrected for differential reddening, we found for the first time two key signs
of the inhomogeneity in the cluster's stellar population and of its radial
variation in the GC. These are (1) an obvious trend in the color-position
diagram, based on the (U-B) color-index, of red giant branch (RGB) stars, which
shows that the farther from the cluster's center, the bluer on average the
(U-B) color of the stars is; and (2) the dependence of the radial distribution
of sub-giant branch (SGB) stars in the cluster on their U magnitude, where
brighter stars are less centrally concentrated than their fainter counterparts
at a confidence level varying between 99.2% and 99.9% depending on the
color-index used to select the stars. The same effects were recently found by
us in the GC NGC 1261. However, contrary to NGC 1261, we are not able to
unambiguously suggest which of the sub-populations of SGB/RGB stars can be the
progenitor of blue and red horizontal branch stars of the cluster. Apart from
M4, NGC 3201 is another GC very probably with an inhomogeneous stellar
population, which has essentially lower mass than the most massive Galactic GCs
where multiple stellar populations were unambiguously detected for the first
time
