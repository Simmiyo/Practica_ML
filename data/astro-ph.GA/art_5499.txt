Spitzer Local Volume Legacy (LVL) SEDs and Physical Properties
We present the panchromatic spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the Local
Volume Legacy (LVL) survey which consists of 258 nearby galaxies ($D<$11 Mpc).
The wavelength coverage spans the ultraviolet to the infrared (1500
$\textrm{\AA}$ to 24 $\mu$m) which is utilized to derive global physical
properties (i.e., star formation rate, stellar mass, internal extinction due to
dust.). With these data, we find color-color relationships and correlated
trends between observed and physical properties (i.e., optical magnitudes and
dust properties, optical color and specific star formation rate, and
ultraviolet-infrared color and metallicity). The SEDs are binned by different
galaxy properties to reveal how each property affects the observed shape of
these SEDs. In addition, due to the volume-limited nature of LVL, we utilize
the dwarf-dominated galaxy sample to test star formation relationships
established with higher-mass galaxy samples. We find good agreement with the
star-forming "main-sequence" relationship, but find a systematic deviation in
the infrared "main-sequence" at low luminosities. This deviation is attributed
to suppressed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) formation in low
metallicity environments and/or the destruction of PAHs in more intense
radiation fields occurring near a suggested threshold in sSFR at a value of
log($sSFR$) $\sim$ $-$10.2.
