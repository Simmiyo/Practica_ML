Millimetric and sub-millimetric observations of IRAS 05327+3404 "Holoea"
  in M36
The transition between the proto-star, Class I, and the pre-main sequence
star, Class II, phases is still one of the most uncertain, and important,
stages in the knowledge of the process of formation of an individual star,
because it is the stage that determines the final mass of the star. We observed
the YSO "Holoea", associated with IRAS 05327+3404, which was classified as an
object in transition between the Class I and Class II phases with several
unusual properties, and appears to be surrounded by large amounts of
circumstellar material. We used the SMA and BIMA telescopes at millimeter and
sub-millimeter wavelengths to observe the dust continuum emission and the CO
(1-0) and (2-1), HCO+ (1-0) and (3-2), and HCN (1-0) transitions in the region
around IRAS 05327+3404. We detected two continuum emission peaks at 1.1-mm: SMM
1, the sub-mm counterpart of IRAS 05327+3404, and SMM 2, ~6 arcsec to the West.
The emissions of the three molecules show marked differences. The CO emission
near the systemic velocity is filtered out by the telescopes, and CO mostly
traces the high-velocity gas. The HCO+ and HCN emissions are more centrally
concentrated around the central parts of the region, and show several intensity
peaks coincident with the sub-mm continuum peaks. We identify two main
molecular outflows: a bipolar outflow in an E-W direction that would be powered
by SMM 1 and another one in a NE direction, which we associate with SMM 2. We
propose that the SMM sources are probably Class I objects, with SMM 1 in an
earlier evolutionary stage.
