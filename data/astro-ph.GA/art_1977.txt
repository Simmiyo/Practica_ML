Multicomponent theory of buoyancy instabilities in magnetized plasmas:
  The case of magnetic field parallel to gravity
We investigate electromagnetic buoyancy instabilities of the electron-ion
plasma with the heat flux based on not the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations,
but using the multicomponent plasma approach when the momentum equations are
solved for each species. We consider a geometry in which the background
magnetic field, gravity, and stratification are directed along one axis. The
nonzero background electron thermal flux is taken into account. Collisions
between electrons and ions are included in the momentum equations. No
simplifications usual for the one-fluid MHD-approach in studying these
instabilities are used. We derive a simple dispersion relation, which shows
that the thermal flux perturbation generally stabilizes an instability for the
geometry under consideration. This result contradicts to conclusion obtained in
the MHD-approach. We show that the reason of this contradiction is the
simplified assumptions used in the MHD analysis of buoyancy instabilities and
the role of the longitudinal electric field perturbation which is not captured
by the ideal MHD equations. Our dispersion relation also shows that the medium
with the electron thermal flux can be unstable, if the temperature gradients of
ions and electrons have the opposite signs. The results obtained can be applied
to the weakly collisional magnetized plasma objects in laboratory and
astrophysics.
