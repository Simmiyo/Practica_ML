IRAS 22198+6336: Discovery of an Intermediate-Mass Hot Core
We present new SMA and PdBI observations of the intermediate-mass object IRAS
22198+6336 in the millimeter continuum and in several molecular line
transitions. The millimeter continuum emission reveals a strong and compact
source with a mass of around 5 Msun and with properties of Class 0 objects. CO
emission shows an outflow with a quadrupolar morphology centered on the
position of the dust condensation. The CO outflow emission seems to come from
two distinct outflows, one of them associated with SiO outflow emission. A
large set of molecular lines has been detected toward a compact dense core
clearly coincident with the compact millimeter source, and showing a velocity
gradient perpendicular to the outflow traced by CO and SiO. The chemically rich
spectrum and the rotational temperatures derived from CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$OH
(100-150 K) indicate that IRAS 22198+6336 is harbouring one the few
intermediate-mass hot cores known at present.
