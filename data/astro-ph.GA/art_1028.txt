Distance to G14.33-0.64 in the Sagittarius Spiral Arm: H2O Maser
  Trigonometric Parallax with VERA
We report on trigonometric parallax measurements for the Galactic star
forming region G14.33-0.64 toward the Sagittarius spiral arm. We conducted
multi-epoch phase-referencing observations of an H2O maser source in
G14.33-0.64 with the Japanese VLBI array VERA. We successfully detected a
parallax of 0.893+/-0.101 mas, corresponding to a source distance of
1.12+/-0.13 kpc, which is less than half of the kinematic distance for
G14.33-0.64. Our new distance measurement demonstrates that the Sagittarius arm
lies at a closer distance of ~1 kpc, instead of previously assumed ~2-3 kpc
from kinematic distances. The previously suggested deviation of the Sagittarius
arm toward the Galactic center from the symmetrically fitted model (Taylor &
Cordes 1993) is likely due to large errors of kinematic distances at low
galactic longitudes. G14.33-0.64 most likely traces the near side of the
Sagittarius arm. We attempted fitting the pitch angle of the arm with other
parallax measurements along the arm, which yielded two possible pitch angles of
i=34.7+/-2.7 degrees and i=11.2+/-10.5 degrees. Our proper motion measurements
suggest G14.33-0.64 has no significant peculiar motion relative to the
differential rotation of the Galaxy (assumed to be in a circular orbit),
indicating that the source motion is in good agreement with the Galactic
rotation.
