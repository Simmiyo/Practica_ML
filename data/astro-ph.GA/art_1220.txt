Molecular cloud distance determination from deep NIR survey extinction
  measurements
Using near infrared UKIDSS Galactic Plane Survey data, we make extinction
measurements to individual stars along the same line of sight as molecular
clouds. Using an existing 3D extinction map of the inner Galaxy, that provides
line of sight specific extinction-distance relationships, we convert the
measured extinction of molecular clouds to a corresponding distance. These
distances are derived independently from kinematic methods, typically used to
derive distances to molecular clouds, and as such they have no near/far
ambiguity. The near/far distance ambiguity has been resolved for 27 clouds and
distances have been derived to 20 clouds. The results are found to be in good
agreement with kinematic measurements to molecular clouds where the ambiguity
has already been resolved, using HI self-absorption techniques.
