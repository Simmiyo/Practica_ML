On the possible generation of the young massive open clusters
  Stephenson2 and BDSB122 by Omega Centauri
A massive objects such as a globular cluster passing through the disk of a
galaxy can trigger star formation. We test the hypothesis that the most massive
globular cluster in the Galaxy, $\omega$ Centauri, which crossed the disk
approximately $24\pm2$ Myr ago, may have triggered the formation of the open
clusters Stephenson 2 and BDSB 122. The orbits of $\omega$ Centauri, Stephenson
2 and BDSB 122 are computed for the three-component model of Johnston,
Hernquist & Bolte, which considers the disk, spheroidal and halo gravitational
potentials. With the re-constructed orbit of $\omega$ Centauri, we show that
the latest impact site is consistent, within important uncertainties, with the
birth-site of the young massive open clusters BDSB 122 and Stephenson 2. Within
uncertainties, this scenario is consistent with the time-scale of their
backwards motion in the disk, shock wave propagation and delay for star
formation. Together with open cluster formation associated to density waves in
spiral arms, the present results are consistent with the idea that massive
globular clusters as additional progenitors of open clusters, the massive ones
in particular.
