The ISM in Distant Galaxies
The interstellar medium (ISM) is a key ingredient in galaxy formation and
evolution as it provides the molecular gas reservoir which fuels star formation
and supermassive black hole accretion. Yet the ISM is one of the least studied
aspects of distant galaxies. Molecular and atomic transitions at
(sub)millimetre wavelengths hold great promise in measuring macroscopic
properties (e.g. masses, morphologies, star formation laws), as well as
microscopic properties (e.g. gas densities, temperatures, cooling) of high-z
galaxies. In this overview I summarize the growing number of high-z molecular
line detections, highlighting some of the most intriguing results along the
way. I end by discussing a few areas where future facilities (e.g. ALMA, EVLA,
CCAT, LMT) will drastically improve on the current state of affairs.
