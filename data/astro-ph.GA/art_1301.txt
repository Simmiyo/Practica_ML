Star clusters in the Sh2-132 complex: clues about the connection between
  embedded and open clusters
Embedded clusters are formed in molecular clouds where massive stars can
produce HII regions. The detailed embedded-open cluster evolutionary connection
as well as the origin of associations are yet to be unveiled. There appears to
be a high infant mortality rate among embedded clusters and the few survivors
evolve to open clusters. We study the colour-magnitude diagrams and structure
of the star clusters related to the Sh2-132 HII region using the 2MASS
database. Cluster fundamental and structural parameters are determined via MS
and PMS isochrones and stellar radial density profiles. We report the discovery
of four clusters. One of them is projected a few diameters away from the
optical cluster Teutsch\,127 and appears to be deeply embedded, seen only in
the infrared. Evidence is found that we are witnessing the dynamical transition
from an embedded to an open cluster. An additional cluster is also close to
Teutsch\,127 and might be associated with a bow-shock. We also study the CMD
and structure of the open cluster Berkeley\,94 in Sh2-132 and a new cluster
which is projected in the outskirts of the complex. Finally, we searched for
star clusters around the two known Wolf-Rayet stars in the complex. One of them
appears to be related to a compact cluster. Finally, the present analyses
suggest early dynamical evolution for young star clusters.
