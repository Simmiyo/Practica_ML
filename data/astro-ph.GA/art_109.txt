What can we learn about quasars from alpha_OX measurements in galactic
  black hole binaries?
We draw a comparison between AGN and Galactic black hole binaries using a
uniform description of spectral energy distribution of these two classes of
accreting X-ray sources. We parametrize spectra of GBHs with an alpha_GBH
parameter which we define as a slope of a nominal power law function between 3
and 20 keV. We show that this parameter can be treated as an equivalent of the
X-ray loudness, alpha_OX, used to describe AGN spectra. We do not find linear
correlation between the alpha_GBH and disc flux (similar to that between
alpha_OX and optical/UV luminosity found in AGN). Instead, we show that
alpha_GBH follows a well defined pattern during a GBH outburst. We find that
alpha_GBH tend to cluster around 1, 1.5 and 2, which correspond to a hard, very
high/intermediate and soft spectral state, respectively. We conclude that
majority of the observed Type 1 radio quiet AGN are in a spectral state
corresponding to a very high/intermediate state of GBHs. The same conclusion is
valid for radio loud AGN. We also study variations of the spectral slopes
(alpha_GBH and the X-ray photon index, Gamma) as a function of disc and
Comptonization fluxes. We discuss these dependencies in the context of
correlations of alpha_OX and Gamma with the optical/UV and X-ray 2 keV fluxes
considered for AGN and quasars.
