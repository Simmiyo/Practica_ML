Schwarzschild Models for the Galaxy
Schwarzschild's orbit-superposition technique is the most developed and
well-tested method available for constraining the detailed mass distributions
of equilibrium stellar systems. Here I provide a very short overview of the
method and its existing implementations, and briefly discuss their viability as
a tool for modeling the Galaxy using Gaia data.
