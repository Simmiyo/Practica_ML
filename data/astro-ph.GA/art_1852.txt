The galaxy population of Abell 1367: photometric and spectroscopic data
Photometric and spectroscopic observations of the galaxy population of the
galaxy cluster Abell 1367 have been obtained, over a field of 34 by 90 arcmin,
covering the cluster centre out to a radius of about 2.2 Mpc. U, B and R
broad-band and H alpha narrow-band imaging observations were carried out using
the Wide Field Camera (WFC) on the 2.5m INT. J and K near-infrared imaging was
obtained using the Wide Field Camera (WFCAM) on the 3.8 m UKIRT, covering a
somewhat smaller field of 0.75 square degrees on the cluster centre. The
spectroscopic observations were carried out using a multifibre spectrograph
(WYFFOS) on the 4.2 m WHT, over the same field as the optical imaging
observations. Our photometric data give optical and near-infrared magnitudes
for 303 galaxies in our survey regions, down to stated diameter and B-band
magnitude limits, determined within R24 isophotal diameters. Our spectroscopic
data of 328 objects provide 84 galaxies with detections of emission and/or
absorption lines. Combining these with published spectroscopic data gives 126
galaxies within our sample for which recession velocities are known. Of these,
72 galaxies are confirmed as cluster members of Abell 1367, 11 of which are
identified in this study. (abridged)
