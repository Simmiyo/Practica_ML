Structure, mass and stability of galactic disks
In this review I concentrate on three areas related to structure of disks in
spiral galaxies. First I will review the work on structure, kinematics and
dynamics of stellar disks. Next I will review the progress in the area of
flaring of HI layers. These subjects are relevant for the presence of dark
matter and lead to the conclusion that disk are in general not `maximal', have
lower M/L ratios than previously suspected and are locally stable w.r.t.
Toomre's Q criterion for local stability. I will end with a few words on
`truncations' in stellar disks.
