Chemical evolution of the Galactic bulge as traced by microlensed dwarf
  and subgiant stars. II. Ages, metallicities, detailed elemental abundances,
  and connections to the Galactic thick disc
The Bulge is the least understood major stellar population of the Milky Way.
Most of what we know about the formation and evolution of the Bulge comes from
bright giant stars. The underlying assumption that giants represent all the
stars, and accurately trace the chemical evolution of a stellar population, is
under debate. In particular, recent observations of a few microlensed dwarf
stars give a very different picture of the evolution of the Bulge from that
given by the giant stars. [ABRIDGED] We perform a detailed elemental abundance
analysis of dwarf stars in the Galactic bulge, based on high-resolution spectra
that were obtained while the stars were optically magnified during
gravitational microlensing events. [ABRIDGED] We present detailed elemental
abundances and stellar ages for six new dwarf stars in the Galactic bulge.
Combining these with previous events, here re-analysed with the same methods,
we study a homogeneous sample of 15 stars, which constitute the largest sample
to date of microlensed dwarf stars in the Galactic bulge. We find that the
stars span the full range of metallicities from [Fe/H]=-0.72 to +0.54, and an
average metallicity of <[Fe/H]>=-0.08+/-0.47, close to the average metallicity
based on giant stars in the Bulge. Furthermore, the stars follow well-defined
abundance trends, that for [Fe/H]<0 are very similar to those of the local
Galactic thick disc. This suggests that the Bulge and the thick disc have had,
at least partially, comparable chemical histories. At sub-solar metallicities
we find the Bulge dwarf stars to have consistently old ages, while at
super-solar metallicities we find a wide range of ages. Using the new age and
abundance results from the microlensed dwarf stars we investigate possible
formation scenarios for the Bulge.
