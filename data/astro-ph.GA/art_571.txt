The Spitzer c2d Survey of Nearby Dense Cores: VI. The Protostars of
  Lynds Dark Nebula 1221
Observations of Lynds Dark Nebula 1221 from the Spitzer Space Telescope are
presented. These data show three candidate protostars towards L1221, only two
of which were previously known. The infrared observations also show signatures
of outflowing material, an interpretation which is also supported by radio
observations with the Very Large Array. In addition, molecular line maps from
the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory are shown.
  One-dimensional dust continuum modelling of two of these protostars, IRS1 and
IRS3, is described. These models show two distinctly different protostars
forming in very similar environments. IRS1 shows a higher luminosity and larger
inner radius of the envelope than IRS3. The disparity could be caused by a
difference in age or mass, orientation of outflow cavities, or the impact of a
binary in the IRS1 core.
