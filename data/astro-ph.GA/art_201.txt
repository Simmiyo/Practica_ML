A molecular outflow evidencing star formation activity in the vicinity
  of the HII region G034.8-0.7 and the SNR W44
This work aims at investigating the molecular gas component in the vicinity
of two young stellar object (YSO) candidates identified at the border of the
HII region G034.8-0.7 that is evolving within a molecular cloud shocked by the
SNR W44. The purpose is to explore signatures of star forming activity in this
complex region. We performed a near and mid infrared study towards the border
of the HII region G034.8-0.7 and observed a 90" X 90" region near 18h 56m 48s,
+01d 18' 45" (J2000) using the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment
(ASTE) in the 12CO J=3--2, 13CO J=3--2, HCO+ J=4--3 and CS J=7--6 lines with an
angular resolution of 22". Based on the infrared study we propose that the
source 2MASS 18564827+0118471 (IR1 in this work) is a YSO candidate. We
discovered a bipolar 12CO outflow in the direction of the line of sight and a
HCO+ clump towards IR1, confirming that it is a YSO. From the detection of the
CS J=7--6 line we infer the presence of high density (>10^7 cm^-3) and warm
(>60 K) gas towards IR1, probably belonging to the protostellar envelope where
the YSO is forming. We investigated the possible genetic connection of IR1 with
the SNR and the HII region. By comparing the dynamical time of the outflows and
the age of the SNR W44, we conclude that the possibility of the SNR has
triggered the formation of IR1 is unlikely. On the other hand, we suggest that
the expansion of the HII region G034.8-0.7 is responsible for the formation of
IR1 through the "collect and collapse" process.
