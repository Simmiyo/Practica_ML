Chemical composition and constraints on mass loss for globular clusters
  in dwarf galaxies: WLM and IKN
We determine the metallicities for globular clusters (GCs) in the WLM and IKN
dwarf galaxies, using VLT/UVES and Keck/ESI spectroscopy. For the WLM GC we
also measure detailed abundance ratios for a number of light, alpha, Fe-peak
and n-capture elements. We find low metallicities of [Fe/H]=-2.0 and -2.1 for
the WLM GC and the GC IKN-5, respectively. We estimate that 17%-31% of the
metal-poor stars in WLM belong to the GC, and IKN-5 may even contain a similar
number of metal-poor stars as the whole of the IKN dwarf itself. These high
ratios of metal-poor GCs to field stars are in tension with GC formation
scenarios that require GCs to have lost a very large fraction of their initial
mass. The GCs in the WLM and IKN dwarf galaxies resemble those in the Fornax
dSph by being significantly more metal-poor than a typical halo GC in the Milky
Way and other large galaxies. They are also substantially more metal-poor than
the bulk of the field stars in their parent galaxies. The overall abundance
patterns in the WLM GC are similar to those observed for GCs in the Fornax
dSph: [Ca/Fe] and [Ti/Fe] are super-Solar at about +0.3 dex, while [Mg/Fe] is
less elevated than [Ca/Fe] and [Ti/Fe]. The [Na/Fe] ratio is similar to the
averaged [Na/Fe] ratios in Milky Way GCs, but higher than those of Milky Way
halo stars. Fe-peak (Mn, Sc, Cr) and heavy elements (Ba, Y, La) generally
follow the trends seen in the Milky Way halo. The relatively high Na abundance
in the WLM GC suggests that the [Na/O] anti-correlation is present in this
cluster.
