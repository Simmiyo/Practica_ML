Linking pre- and proto-stellar objects in the intermediate-/high-mass
  star forming region IRAS 05345+3157
To better understand the initial conditions of the high-mass star formation
process, it is crucial to study at high-angular resolution the morphology, the
kinematics, and eventually the interactions of the coldest condensations
associated with intermediate-/high-mass star forming regions. The paper studies
the cold condensations in the intermediate-/high-mass proto-cluster IRAS
05345+3157, focusing the attention on the interaction with the other objects in
the cluster. We have performed millimeter high-angular resolution observations,
both in the continuum and several molecular lines, with the PdBI and the SMA.
In a recent paper, we have already published part of these data. The main
finding of that work was the detection of two cold and dense gaseous
condensations, called N and S (masses ~2 and ~9 M_sun), characterised by high
values of the deuterium fractionation (~0.1 in both cores). In this paper, we
present a full report of the observations, and a complete analysis of the data
obtained. The millimeter maps reveal the presence of 3 cores inside the
interferometers primary beam, called C1-a, C1-b and C2. None of them are
associated with cores N and S. C1-b is very likely associated with a newly
formed early-B ZAMS star embedded inside a hot-core, while C1-a is more likely
associated with a class 0 intermediate-mass protostar. The nature of C2 is
unclear. Both C1-a and C1-b are good candidates as driving sources of a
powerful CO outflow, which strongly interacts with N and S, as demonstrated by
the velocity gradient across both condensations. Our major conclusion is that
the chemical properties of these pre-stellar cores are similar to those
observed in low-mass isolated ones, while the kinematics is dominated by the
turbulence triggered by the CO outflow and can influece their evolution.
