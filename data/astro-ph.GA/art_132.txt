Cataclysmic Variables from SDSS VII. The Seventh Year (2006)
Coordinates, magnitudes and spectra are presented for 39 cataclysmic
variables found in Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra that were primarily
obtained in 2006. Of these, 12 were CVs identified prior to the SDSS spectra
(GY Cnc, GO Com, ST LMi, NY Ser, MR Ser, QW Ser, EU UMa, IY UMa, HS1340+1524,
RXJ1610.1+0352, Boo 1, Leo 5). Follow-up spectroscopic observations of seven
systems (including one from year 2005 and another from year 2004) were
obtained, resulting in estimates of the orbital periods for 3 objects. The new
CVs include two candidates for high inclination, eclipsing systems, 4 new
Polars and three systems whose spectra clearly reveal atmospheric absorption
lines from the underlying white dwarf.
