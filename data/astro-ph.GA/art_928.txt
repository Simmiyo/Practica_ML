Spitzer IRAC imaging photometric study of the massive star forming
  region AFGL 437
We present {\it Spitzer} IRAC mid-infrared photometry on the massive star
forming region AFGL 437 (IRAS 03035+5819). From the IRAC colour-colour diagram,
we identify several new embedded YSOs within 64 arcsec of the central compact
cluster. Using the IRAC ratio images, we investigate the molecular outflows
associated with the highly embedded young stellar object WK34 in the central
cluster. We attribute the lobes seen (extended to $\sim$ 0.16 pc in the north)
in the ratio map to shocked molecular hydrogen emission. IRAC images reveal a
large diffuse nebulosity associated with the central cluster and extending up
to $\sim$ 8.0 pc from south-west to north-east direction with its brightness
gradually increasing from 3.6 to 8.0 $\mu$m. A dense box-car-shaped nebula
(more than 2.0 pc in size) situated to the south-west of the cluster shows
molecular hydrogen emission that may have been caused by shock waves from the
compact cluster sources. It seems that these sources are also responsible for
the infrared-bright nebulosity. Using a 2D radiative transfer model, we derive
from the spectral energy distributions, the mass, age and luminosity of all the
YSOs identified within the central cluster. The SED modelling shows that the
driving engine of the outflows, WK34, appears to be massive but very young and
deeply embedded. The weighted mean values of the masses and ages of the 21 YSOs
derived from the model are in the range 1-10 \msun and 10$^{4.1 - 6.4}$ yr
respectively; while their luminosities are in the range of 10$^{0.47-3.48}$
L$_{\odot}$.
