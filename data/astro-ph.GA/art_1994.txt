Sensitive Observations of Radio Recombination Lines in Orion and W51:
  The Data and Detection of Systematic Recombination Line Blueshifts
  Proportional to Impact Broadening
Sensitive spectral observations made in two frequency bands near 6.0 and 17.6
GHz are described for Orion and W51. Using frequency switching we were able to
achieve a dynamic range in excess of 10,000 without fitting sinusoidal or
polynomial baselines. This enabled us to detect lines as weak as T$_{A} ~1mK in
these strong continuum sources. Hydrogen recombination lines with $\Delta n$ as
high as 25 have been detected in Orion. In the Orion data, where the lines are
stronger, we have also detected a systematic shift in the line center
frequencies proportional to linewidth that cannot be explained by normal
optical depth effects.
