Origin and structure of the Galactic disc(s)
We examine the chemical and dynamical structure in the solar neighbourhood of
a model Galaxy that is the endpoint of a simulation of the chemical evolution
of the Milky Way in the presence of radial mixing of stars and gas. Although
the simulation's star-formation rate declines monotonically from its unique
peak and no merger or tidal event ever takes place, the model replicates all
known properties of a thick disc, as well as matching special features of the
local stellar population such as a metal-poor extension of the thin disc that
has high rotational velocity. We divide the disc by chemistry and relate this
dissection to observationally more convenient kinematic selection criteria. We
conclude that the observed chemistry of the Galactic disc does not provide
convincing evidence for a violent origin of the thick disc, as has been widely
claimed.
