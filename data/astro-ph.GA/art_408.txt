An Analysis of the Shapes of Interstellar Extinction Curves. VI. The
  Near-IR Extinction Law
We combine new HST/ACS observations and existing data to investigate the
wavelength dependence of NIR extinction. Previous studies suggest a power-law
form, with a "universal" value of the exponent, although some recent
observations indicate that significant sight line-to-sight line variability may
exist. We show that a power-law model provides an excellent fit to most NIR
extinction curves, but that the value of the power, beta, varies significantly
from sight line-to-sight line. Therefore, it seems that a "universal NIR
extinction law" is not possible. Instead, we find that as beta decreases, R(V)
[=A(V)/E(B-V)] tends to increase, suggesting that NIR extinction curves which
have been considered "peculiar" may, in fact, be typical for different R(V)
values. We show that the power law parameters can depend on the wavelength
interval used to derive them, with the beta increasing as longer wavelengths
are included. This result implies that extrapolating power law fits to
determine R(V) is unreliable. To avoid this problem, we adopt a different
functional form for NIR extinction. This new form mimics a power law whose
exponent increases with wavelength, has only 2 free parameters, can fit all of
our curves over a longer wavelength baseline and to higher precision, and
produces R(V) values which are consistent with independent estimates and
commonly used methods for estimating R(V). Furthermore, unlike the power law
model, it gives R(V)'s that are independent of the wavelength interval used to
derive them. It also suggests that the relation R(V) = -1.36 E(K-V)/E(B-V) -
0.79 can estimate R(V) to +/-0.12. Finally, we use model extinction curves to
show that our extinction curves are in accord with theoretical expectations.
