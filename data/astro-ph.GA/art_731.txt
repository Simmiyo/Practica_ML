Optical Imaging and Spectroscopic Observation of the Galactic Supernova
  Remnant G85.9-0.6
Optical CCD imaging with H$\alpha$ and [SII] filters and spectroscopic
observations of the galactic supernova remnant G85.9-0.6 have been performed
for the first time. The CCD image data are taken with the 1.5m Russian-Turkish
Telescope (RTT150) at TUBITAK National Observatory (TUG) and spectral data are
taken with the Bok 2.3 m telescope on Kitt Peak, AZ.
  The images are taken with narrow-band interference filters H$\alpha$, [SII]
and their continuum. [SII]/H$\alpha$ ratio image is performed. The ratio
obtained from [SII]/H$\alpha$ is found to be $\sim$0.42, indicating that the
remnant interacts with HII regions. G85.9-0.6 shows diffuse-shell morphology.
[SII]$\lambda\lambda 6716/6731$ average flux ratio is calculated from the
spectra, and the electron density $N_{e}$ is obtained to be 395 $cm^{-3}$. From
[OIII]/H$\beta$ ratio, shock velocity has been estimated, pre-shock density of
$n_{c}=14$ $cm^{-3}$, explosion energy of $E=9.2\times10^{50}$ ergs,
interstellar extinction of $E(B-V)=0.28$, and neutral hydrogen column density
of $N(HI)=1.53\times10^{21}$ $cm^{-2}$ are reported.
