Testing the Evolutionary Sequence of High Mass Protostars with CARMA
We present 1" resolution CARMA observations of the 3mm continuum and 95 GHz
methanol masers toward 14 candidate high mass protostellar objects (HMPOs).
Dust continuum emission is detected toward seven HMPOs, and methanol masers
toward 5 sources. The 3mm continuum sources have diameters < 2x10^4 AU, masses
between 21 and 1200 M_sun, and volume densities > 10^8 cm^-3. Most of the 3mm
continuum sources are spatially coincident with compact HII regions and/or
water masers, and are presumed to be formation sites of massive stars. A strong
correlation exists between the presence of 3mm continuum emission, 22 GHz water
masers, and 95 GHz methanol masers. However, no 3mm continuum emission is
detected toward ultracompact HII regions lacking maser emission. These results
are consistent with the hypothesis that 22 GHz water masers and methanol masers
are signposts of an early phase in the evolution of an HMPO before an expanding
HII region destroys the accretion disk.
