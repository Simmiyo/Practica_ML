Dust properties in M31.I.Basic properties and a discussion on
  age-dependent dust heating
Context. Spitzer Space Telescope observations and dust emission models are
used to discuss the distribution of dust and its characteristics in M31.
Together with GALEX FUV, NUV, and SDSS images we studied the age dependence of
the dust heating process. Methods.Spitzer IRAC/MIPS maps of M31 were matched
together and compared to dust emission models allowing to constrain the dust
mass, the intensity of the mean radiation field, the abundance of Polycyclic
Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) particles. The total infrared emission (TIR) was
analyzed in function of UV and Optical colors and compared to predictions of
models which consider the age-dependent dust heating. Results. We demonstrate
that cold-dust component emission dominates the infrared spectral energy
distribution of M31. The mean intensity of the radiation field heating the dust
is low (typically U<2, where U=1 is the value in the solar surrounding). Due to
the lack of submillimetric measurements the dust mass (M_{dust}) is only weakly
constrained by the infrared spectrum. We show that across the spiral-ring
structure of M31 a fraction >3% of the total dust mass is in PAHs. UV and
optical colors are correlated to (TIR/FUV) ratios in \sim 670 pc-sized regions
overall the disk of M31, although deviating from the IRX-beta relationship for
starburst galaxies. We derived that in 83% of the regions analyzed across the
10kpc ring more than 50% of the energy absorbed by the dust is rediated at
\lambda > 4000 \AA and that dust in M31 appears mainly heated by populations a
few Gyr old even across the star-forming ring. The attenuation is varying
radially peaking near 10kpc and decreasing faster in the inner regions of M31
than in the outer regions. We finally derived the attenuation map of M31 at
6"/px resolution (\sim 100 pc/px along the plane of M31).[abridged]
