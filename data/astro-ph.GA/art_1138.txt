Cosmic Ray Accelerators in the Large Magellanic Cloud
I point out a correlation between gamma-ray emissivity and the historical
star formation rate in the Large Magellanic Cloud ~12.5 Myr ago. This
correlation bolsters the view that CRs in the LMC are accelerated by
conglomerations of supernova remnants: i.e. superbubbles and supergiant shells.
