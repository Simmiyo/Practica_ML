PSR J0737-3039B: A probe of radio pulsar emission heights
In the double pulsar system PSR J0737-3039A/B the strong wind produced by
pulsar A distorts the magnetosphere of pulsar B. The influence of these
distortions on the orbital-dependent emission properties of pulsar B can be
used to determine the location of the coherent radio emission generation region
in the pulsar magnetosphere. Using a model of the wind-distorted magnetosphere
of pulsar B and the well defined geometrical parameters of the system, we
determine the minimum emission height to be ~ 20 neutron star radii in the two
bright orbital longitude regions. We can determine the maximum emission height
by accounting for the amount of deflection of the polar field line with respect
to the magnetic axis using the analytical magnetic reconnection model of Dungey
and the semi-empirical numerical model of Tsyganenko. Both of these models
estimate the maximum emission height to be ~ 2500 neutron star radii. The
minimum and maximum emission heights we calculate are consistent with those
estimated for normal isolated pulsars.
