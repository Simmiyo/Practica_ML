Far-ultraviolet Emission-line Morphologies of the Supernova Remnant
  G65.3+5.7
We present the first far-ultraviolet (FUV) emission-line morphologies of the
whole region of the supernova remnant (SNR) G65.3+5.7 using the FIMS/SPEAR
data. The morphologies of the C IV {\lambda}{\lambda}1548, 1551, He II
{\lambda}1640, and O III] {\lambda}{\lambda}1661, 1666 lines appear to be
closely related to the optical and/or soft X-ray images obtained in previous
studies. Dramatic differences between the C IV morphology and the optical [O
III] {\lambda}5007 image provide clues to a large resonant-scattering region
and a foreground dust cloud. The FUV morphologies also reveal the overall
distribution of various shocks in different evolutionary phases and an
evolutionary asymmetry between the east and the southwest sides in terms of
Galactic coordinates, possibly due to a Galactic density gradient in the global
scale. The relative X-ray luminosity of G65.3+5.7 to C IV luminosity is
considerably lower than those of the Cygnus Loop and the Vela SNRs. This
implies that G65.3+5.7 has almost evolved into the radiative stage in the
global sense and supports the previous proposal that G65.3+5.7 has lost its
bright X-ray shell and become a member of mixed-morphology SNRs as it has
evolved beyond the adiabatic stage.
