Distance and proper motion measurement of water masers in Shapless 269
  IRS 2w
We present astrometric analysis of archival data of water masers in the
star-forming region Sharpless 269 (S269) IRS 2w, observed with the VLBI
Exploration of Radio Astrometry. An annual parallax of one of the bright maser
features in this region was previously reported to be 0.189+/-0.008
milliarcsecond (mas) using part of the same archival data as we used. However,
we found that this maser feature is not the best to represent the annual
parallax to S269 IRS 2w because the morphology is remarkably elongated in the
east-west direction. For this study we have selected another maser feature
showing simpler morphology. This makes the new annual parallax estimate more
credible. Our newly obtained annual parallax is 0.247+/-0.034 mas,
corresponding to 4.05+0.65-0.49 kpc. This value is well consistent with the
3.7-3.8 kpc obtained using the kinematic distance estimates and photometric
distance modulus. We considered two hypotheses for the water maser spatial
distribution, a bipolar outflow and an expanding ring, in a kinematic model
fitting analysis with a radially expanding flow. At this stage, any conclusions
about the systemic proper motion could not be drawn from the kinematic
analysis. Alternatively, we evaluated the mean proper motion to be
(0.39+/-0.92, -1.27+/-0.90) mas/yr eastward and northward, respectively, from
the obtained proper motions of the detected water maser features. The newly
obtained annual parallax and mean proper motion give the peculiar motion of
S269 IRS 2w to be (Us, Vs, Ws) of (8+/-6, -21+/-17, 1+/-18) km/s.
