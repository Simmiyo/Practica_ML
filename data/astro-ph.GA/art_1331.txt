A 33 GHz VSA survey of the Galactic plane from 27 to 46 degrees
The Very Small Array (VSA) has been used to survey the l = 27 to 46 deg,
|b|<4 deg region of the Galactic plane at a resolution of 13 arcmin. The survey
consists of 44 pointings of the VSA, each with a r.m.s. sensitivity of ~90
mJy/beam. These data are combined in a mosaic to produce a map of the area. The
majority of the sources within the map are HII regions. We investigated
anomalous radio emission from the warm dust in 9 HII regions of the survey by
making spectra extending from GHz frequencies to the FIR IRAS frequencies.
Acillary radio data at 1.4, 2.7, 4.85, 8.35, 10.55, 14.35 and 94 GHz in
addition to the 100, 60, 25 and 12 micron IRAS bands were used to construct the
spectra. From each spectrum the free-free, thermal dust and anomalous dust
emission were determined for each HII region. The mean ratio of 33 GHz
anomalous flux density to FIR 100 micron flux density for the 9 selected HII
regions was 1.10 +/-0.21x10^(-4). When combined with 6 HII regions previously
observed with the VSA and the CBI, the anomalous emission from warm dust in HII
regions is detected with a 33 GHz emissivity of 4.65 +/- 0.4 micro K/ (MJy/sr)
at 11.5{\sigma}. The anomalous radio emission in HII regions is on average
41+/-10 per cent of the radio continuum at 33 GHz.
