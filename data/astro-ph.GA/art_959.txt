Supersonically Turbulent, Shock Bound Interaction Zones
Shock bound interaction zones (SBIZs) are ubiquitous in astrophysics. We
present numerical results for 2D and 3D, plane-parallel, infinitely extended
SBIZs. Isothermal settings and parameterized cooling are considered. We
highlight and compare characteristic of such zones. We emphasize the mutual
coupling between the turbulence within the SBIZ and the confining shocks, point
out potential differences to 3D periodic box studies of supersonic turbulence,
and contemplate on possible effects on the X-ray emission of such zones.
