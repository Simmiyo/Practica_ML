NGC 5128: The Giant Beneath
I review what we have learned about the old stellar population of NGC 5128,
the only large E galaxy close enough that we can currently observe individual
stars as faint as the horizontal branch. Although its galaxy type is still a
matter of debate for some, the uncertainties over distance are now largely
resolved; comparison of five stellar distance indicators gives d=3.8 +- 0.1
Mpc. The globular cluster system, which was once perplexingly invisible, is now
known to be predominantly old with a substantial metal-rich component. The GCS
total population and luminosity function are normal and the clusters follow the
same fundamental plane relation as those in the Milky Way and M31. Finally, the
halo out to at least ~7r_{eff} is dominated by metal-rich stars which are also
predominantly old, with age and metallicity tantalizingly similar to the
majority of globular clusters.
