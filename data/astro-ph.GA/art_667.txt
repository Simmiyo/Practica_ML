A study of major mergers using a multi-phase ISM code
Galaxy interactions are a common phenomenon in clusters of galaxies.
Especially major mergers are of particular importance, because they can change
the morphological type of galaxies. They have an impact on the mass function of
galaxies and they trigger star formation - the main driver of the Galactic
Matter Cycle. Therefore, we conducted a study of major mergers by means of a
multi-phase ISM code. This code is based on a TREE-SPH-code combined with a
sticky particle method allowing for star formation controlled by the properties
of a multi-phase ISM. This is in contrast to the usually implemented Schmidt
law depending mainly on the gas density. Previously, this code was used on
isolated galaxies. Since our star formation recipe is not restricted to a
special type of galaxy, it is interesting to apply it to interacting galaxies,
too. Our study on major mergers includes a research of global properties of the
interacting system, namely the star formation rate and the star formation
efficiency, the evaporation and condensation rates, as well as the mass
exchange of distinct components, namely stars, diffuse ISM, and clouds.
Investigating these properties provides insight to interrelations between
various physical processes. The results indicate that the star formation
efficiency as well as the evaporation and condensation rates are influenced by
the interaction.
