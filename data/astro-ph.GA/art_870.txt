A Multiwavelength View of a Mass Outflow from the Galactic Center
The Galactic center (GC) lobe is a degree-tall shell of gas that spans the
central degree of our Galaxy. It has been cited as evidence for a mass outflow
from our GC region, which has inspired diverse models for its origin. However,
most work has focused on the morphology of the GC lobe, which has made it
difficult to draw strong conclusions about its nature. Here, I present a
coherent, multiwavelength analysis of new and archival observations of the GC
lobe. Radio continuum emission shows that the GC lobe has a magnetized layer
with a diameter of 110 pc and an equipartition field strength ranging from 40
to 100 $\mu$G. Recombination line emission traces an ionized shell nested
within the radio continuum with diameter of 80 pc and height 165 pc.
Mid-infrared maps at 8 and 15 $\mu$m show that the GC lobe has a third layer of
warm dust and PAH-emission that surrounds the radio continuum shell with a
diameter of 130 pc. Assuming adiabatic expansion of the gas in the GC lobe, its
formation required an energy input of about $5\times10^{52}$ ergs. I compare
the physical conditions of the GC lobe to several models and find best
agreement with the canonical starburst outflow model. The formation of the GC
lobe is consistent with the currently observed pressure and star formation rate
in the central tens of parsecs of our Galaxy. Outflows of this scale are more
typical of dwarf galaxies and would not be easily detected in nearby spiral
galaxies. Thus, the existence of such an outflow in our own Galaxy may indicate
that it is relatively common phenomenon in the nuclei of spiral galaxies.
