Star Formation Patterns and Hierarchies
Star formation occurs in hierarchical patterns in both space and time.
Galaxies form large regions on the scale of the interstellar Jeans length and
these large regions apparently fragment into giant molecular clouds and cloud
cores in a sequence of decreasing size and increasing density. Young stars
follow this pattern, producing star complexes on the largest scales, OB
associations on smaller scales, and so on down to star clusters and individual
stars. Inside each scale and during the lifetime of the cloud on that scale,
smaller regions come and go in a hierarchy of time. As a result, cluster
positions are correlated with power law functions, and so are their ages. At
the lowest level in the hierarchy, clusters are observed to form in pairs. For
any hierarchy like this, the efficiency is automatically highest in the densest
regions. This high efficiency promotes bound cluster formation. Also for any
hierarchy, the mass function of the components is a power law with a slope of
around -2, as observed for clusters.
