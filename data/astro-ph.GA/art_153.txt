Properties of the ionized gas in HH202. II: Results from echelle
  spectrophotometry with UVES
We present results of deep echelle spectrophotometry of the brightest knot of
the HH202 in the Orion Nebula --HH202-S-- using the ultraviolet Visual Echelle
Spectrograph (UVES). The high spectral resolution has permitted to separate the
component associated with the ambient gas from that associated with the gas
flow. We derive electron densities and temperatures for both components, as
well as the chemical abundances of several ions and elements from collisionally
excited lines, including the first determinations of Ca^{+} and Cr^{+}
abundances in the Orion Nebula. We also calculate the He^{+}, C^{2+}, O^{+} and
O^{2+} abundances from recombination lines. The difference between the O^{2+}
abundances determined from collisionally excited and recombination lines --the
so-called abundance discrepancy factor-- is 0.35 dex and 0.11 dex for the shock
and nebular components, respectively. Assuming that the abundance discrepancy
is produced by spatial variations in the electron temperature, we derive values
of the temperature fluctuation parameter, t^2, of 0.050 and 0.016, for the
shock and nebular components, respectively. Interestingly, we obtain almost
coincident t^2 values for both components from the analysis of the intensity
ratios of He I lines. We find significant departures from case B predictions in
the Balmer and Paschen flux ratios of lines of high principal quantum number n.
We analyze the ionization structure of HH202-S, finding enough evidence to
conclude that the flow of HH202-S has compressed the ambient gas inside the
nebula trapping the ionization front. We measure a strong increase of the total
abundances of nickel and iron in the shock component, the abundance pattern and
the results of photoionization models for both components are consistent with
the partial destruction of dust after the passage of the shock wave in HH202-S.
