Radial orbit instability: review and perspectives
This paper presents elements about the radial orbit instability, which occurs
in spherical self-gravitating systems with a strong anisotropy in the radial
velocity direction. It contains an overview on the history of radial orbit
instability. We also present the symplectic method we use to explore stability
of equilibrium states, directly related to the dissipation induced instability
mechanism well known in theoretical mechanics and plasma physics.
