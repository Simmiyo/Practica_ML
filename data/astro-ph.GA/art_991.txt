Exact gravitational lensing and rotation curve
Based on the geodesic equation in a static spherically symmetric metric we
discuss the rotation curve and gravitational lensing. The rotation curve
determines one function in the metric without assuming Einstein's equations.
Then lensing is considered in the weak field approximation of general
relativity. From the null geodesics we derive the lensing equation and
corrections to it.
