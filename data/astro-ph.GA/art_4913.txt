Planck's confirmation of the M31 disk and halo rotation
Planck's data acquired during the first 15.4 months of observations towards
both the disk and halo of the M31 galaxy are analyzed. We confirm the existence
of a temperature asymmetry, previously detected by using the 7-year WMAP data,
along the direction of the M31 rotation, therefore indicative of a
Doppler-induced effect. The asymmetry extends up to about 10 degrees (about 130
kpc) from the M31 center. We also investigate the recent issue raised in Rubin
and Loeb (2014) about the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect from the diffuse hot
gas in the Local Group, predicted to generate a hot spot of a few degrees size
in the CMB maps in the direction of M31, where the free electron optical depth
gets the maximum value. We also consider the issue whether in the opposite
direction with respect to the M31 galaxy the same effect induces a minimum in
temperature in the Planck's maps of the sky. We find that the Planck's data at
100 GHz show an effect even larger than that expected.
