Fractional Models of Cosmic Ray Acceleration in the Galaxy
Possible formulations of the problem of cosmic rays acceleration in the
interstellar galactic medium are considered with the use of fractional
differential equations. The applied technique has been physically justified. A
Fermi result has been generalized to the case of the acceleration of particles
in shock waves in the supernovae remnants fractally distributed in the Galaxy.
