The Membership and Distance of the Open Cluster Collinder 419
The young open cluster Collinder 419 surrounds the massive O star, HD 193322,
that is itself a remarkable multiple star system containing at least four
components. Here we present a discussion of the cluster distance based upon new
spectral classifications of the brighter members, UBV photometry, and an
analysis of astrometric and photometric data from the UCAC3 and 2MASS catalogs.
We determine an average cluster reddening of E(B-V)=0.37 +- 0.05 mag and a
cluster distance of 741 +- 36 pc. The cluster probably contains some very young
stars that may include a reddened M3 III star, IRAS~20161+4035.
