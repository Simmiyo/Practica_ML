Structure and Feedback in 30 Doradus I: Observations
We have completed a a new optical imaging and spectrophotometric survey of a
140 x 80 pc$^2$ region of 30 Doradus centered on R136, covering key optical
diagnostic emission lines including \Ha, \Hb, \Hg, [O III]
$\lambda\lambda$4363, 4959, 5007, [N II] $\lambda\lambda$6548, 6584, [S II]
$\lambda\lambda$6717, 6731 [S III] $\lambda $6312 and in some locations [S III]
$\lambda$9069. We present maps of fluxes and intensity ratios for these lines,
and catalogs of isolated ionizing stars, elephant-trunk pillars, and edge-on
ionization fronts. The final science-quality spectroscopic data products are
available to the public. Our analysis of the new data finds that, while stellar
winds and supernovae undoubtedly produce shocks and are responsible for shaping
the nebula, there are no global spectral signatures to indicate that shocks are
currently an important source of ionization. We conclude that the considerable
region covered by our survey is well described by photoionization from the
central cluster where the ionizing continuum is dominated by the most massive O
stars. We show that if 30 Dor were viewed at a cosmological distance, its
integrated light would be dominated by its extensive regions of lower
surface-brightness rather than by the bright, eye-catching arcs.
