Lutz-Kelker bias in pulsar parallax measurements
Lutz & Kelker showed that parallax measurements are systematically
overestimated because they do not properly account for the larger volume of
space that is sampled at smaller parallax values. We apply their analysis to
neutron stars, incorporating the bias introduced by the intrinsic radio
luminosity function and a realistic Galactic population model for neutron
stars. We estimate the bias for all published neutron star parallax
measurements and find that measurements with less than ~95% certainty, are
likely to be significantly biased. Through inspection of historic parallax
measurements, we confirm the described effects in optical and radio
measurements, as well as in distance estimates based on interstellar dispersion
measures. The potential impact on future tests of relativistic gravity through
pulsar timing and on X-ray--based estimates of neutron star radii is briefly
discussed.
