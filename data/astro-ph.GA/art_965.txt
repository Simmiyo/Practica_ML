The RMS Survey: Far-Infrared Photometry of Young Massive Stars
Context: The Red MSX Source (RMS) survey is a multi-wavelength campaign of
follow-up observations of a colour-selected sample of candidate massive young
stellar objects (MYSOs) in the galactic plane. This survey is returning the
largest well-selected sample of MYSOs to date, while identifying other dust
contaminant sources with similar mid-infrared colours including a large number
of new ultra-compact (UC)HII regions. Aims:To measure the far-infrared (IR)
flux, which lies near the peak of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of
MYSOs and UCHII regions, so that, together with distance information, the
luminosity of these sources can be obtained. Methods:Less than 50% of RMS
sources are associated with IRAS point sources with detections at 60 micron and
100 micron, though the vast majority are visible in Spitzer MIPSGAL or IRAS
Galaxy Atlas (IGA) images. However, standard aperture photometry is not
appropriate for these data due to crowding of sources and strong spatially
variable far-IR background emission in the galactic plane. A new technique
using a 2-dimensional fit to the background in an annulus around each source is
therefore used to obtain far-IR photometry for young RMS sources.
Results:Far-IR fluxes are obtained for a total of 1113 RMS candidates
identified as young sources. Of these 734 have flux measurements using IGA 60
micron and 100 micron images and 724 using MIPSGAL 70 micron images, with 345
having measurements in both data sets.
