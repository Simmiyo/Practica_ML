The Shape and Profile of the Milky Way Halo as Seen by the CFHT Legacy
  Survey
We use Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey data for 170 deg^2,
recalibrated and transformed to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ugri photometric
system, to study the distribution of near-turnoff main-sequence stars in the
Galactic halo along four lines of sight to heliocentric distances of ~35 kpc.
We find that the halo stellar number density profile becomes steeper at
Galactocentric distances greater than R_{gal}~28 kpc, with the power law index
changing from n_{inner}=-2.62+-0.04 to n_{outer}=-3.8+-0.1. In particular, we
test a series of single power law models and find them to be strongly
disfavored by the data. The parameters for the best-fit Einasto profile are
n=2.2+-0.2 and R_e=22.2+-0.4 kpc. We measure the oblateness of the halo to be
q=c/a=0.70+-0.01 and detect no evidence of it changing across the range of
probed distances. The Sagittarius stream is detected in the l=173 and b=-62
direction as an overdensity of [Fe/H] ~ -1.5 dex stars at R_{gal}~32 kpc,
providing a new constraint for the Sagittarius stream and dark matter halo
models. We also detect the Monoceros stream as an overdensity of [Fe/H] > -1.5
dex stars in the l=232 and b=26 direction at R_{gal}<25 kpc. In the two
sightlines where we do not detect significant substructure, the median
metallicity is found to be independent of distance within systematic
uncertainties ([Fe/H] ~ -1.5+-0.1 dex).
