Spatially and Spectrally Resolved Hydrogen Gas within 0.1 AU of T Tauri
  and Herbig Ae/Be Stars
We present near-infrared observations of T Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be stars with
a spatial resolution of a few milli-arcseconds and a spectral resolution of
~2000. Our observations spatially resolve gas and dust in the inner regions of
protoplanetary disks, and spectrally resolve broad-linewidth emission from the
Brackett gamma transition of hydrogen gas. We use the technique of
spectro-astrometry to determine centroids of different velocity components of
this gaseous emission at a precision orders of magnitude better than the
angular resolution. In all sources, we find the gaseous emission to be more
compact than or distributed on similar spatial scales to the dust emission. We
attempt to fit the data with models including both dust and Brackett
gamma-emitting gas, and we consider both disk and infall/outflow morphologies
for the gaseous matter. In most cases where we can distinguish between these
two models, the data show a preference for infall/outflow models. In all cases,
our data appear consistent with the presence of some gas at stellocentric radii
of ~0.01 AU. Our findings support the hypothesis that Brackett gamma emission
generally traces magnetospherically driven accretion and/or outflows in young
star/disk systems.
