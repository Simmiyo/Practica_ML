The End of the White Dwarf Cooling Sequence in M4: an efficient approach
We use 14 orbits of ACS observations to reach the end of the white-dwarf
cooling sequence in the globular cluster M4. Our photometry and completeness
tests show that the end is located at magnitude m_F606W = 28.5+/-0.1, which
implies an age of 11.6+/-0.6 Gyr (internal errors only). This is consistent
with the age from fits to the main sequence turn-off (12.0+/-1.4 Gyr).
