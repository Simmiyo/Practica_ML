Global HI Kinematics in Dwarf Galaxies
HI line widths are typically interpreted as a measure of ISM turbulence,
which is potentially driven by star formation. In an effort to better
understand the possible connections between line widths and star formation, we
have characterized \hi{} kinematics in a sample of nearby dwarf galaxies by
co-adding line-of-sight spectra after removing the rotational velocity to
produce an average, global \hi{} line profile. These "superprofiles" are
composed of a central narrow peak (~6-10 km/s) with higher-velocity wings to
either side that contain ~10-15% of the total flux. The superprofiles are all
very similar, indicating a universal global HI profile for dwarf galaxies. We
compare characteristics of the superprofiles to various galaxy properties, such
as mass and measures of star formation (SF), with the assumption that the
superprofile represents a turbulent peak with energetic wings to either side.
We use these quantities to derive average scale heights for the sample
galaxies. When comparing to physical properties, we find that the velocity
dispersion of the central peak is correlated with $<\Sigma_\mathrm{HI}>$. The
fraction of mass and characteristic velocity of the high velocity wings are
correlated with measures of SF, consistent with the picture that SF drives
surrounding HI to higher velocities. While gravitational instabilities provide
too little energy, the SF in the sample galaxies does provide enough energy
through supernovae, with realistic estimates of the coupling efficiency, to
produce the observed superprofiles.
