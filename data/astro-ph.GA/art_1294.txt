Resonant relaxation and the warp of the stellar disc in the Galactic
  centre
Observations of the spatial distribution and kinematics of young stars in the
Galactic centre can be interpreted as showing that the stars occupy one, or
possibly two, discs of radii ~0.05-0.5 pc. The most prominent (`clockwise')
disc exhibits a strong warp: the normals to the mean orbital planes in the
inner and outer third of the disc differ by ~60 deg. Using an analytical model
based on Laplace-Lagrange theory, we show that such warps arise naturally and
inevitably through vector resonant relaxation between the disc and the
surrounding old stellar cluster.
