An X-ray upper limit on the presence of a Neutron Star for the Small
  Magellanic Cloud and Supernova Remnant 1E0102.2-7219
We present Chandra X-ray Observatory archival observations of the supernova
remnant 1E0102.2-7219, a young Oxygen-rich remnant in the Small Magellanic
Cloud. Combining 28 ObsIDs for 324 ks of total exposure time, we present an
ACIS image with an unprecedented signal-to-noise ratio (mean S/N ~ sqrt(S) ~6;
maximum S/N > 35) . We search within the remnant, using the source detection
software {\sc wavdetect}, for point sources which may indicate a compact
object. Despite finding numerous detections of high significance in both broad
and narrow band images of the remnant, we are unable to satisfactorily
distinguish whether these detections correspond to emission from a compact
object. We also present upper limits to the luminosity of an obscured compact
stellar object which were derived from an analysis of spectra extracted from
the high signal-to-noise image. We are able to further constrain the
characteristics of a potential neutron star for this remnant with the results
of the analysis presented here, though we cannot confirm the existence of such
an object for this remnant.
