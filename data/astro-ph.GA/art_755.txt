Diamonds on the Hat: Globular Clusters in The Sombrero Galaxy (M104)
Images from the HST ACS are used to carry out a new photometric study of the
globular clusters (GCs) in M104, the Sombrero galaxy. The primary focus of our
study is the characteristic distribution function of linear sizes (SDF) of the
GCs. We measure the effective radii for 652 clusters with PSF-convolved King
and Wilson dynamical model fits. The SDF is remarkably similar to those
measured for other large galaxies of all types, adding strong support to the
view that it is a "universal" feature of globular cluster systems.
  We develop a more general interpretation of the size distribution function
for globular clusters, proposing that the shape of the SDF that we see today
for GCs is strongly influenced by the early rapid mass loss during their star
forming stage, coupled with stochastic differences from cluster to cluster in
the star formation efficiency (SFE) and their initial sizes. We find that the
observed SDF shape can be accurately predicted by a simple model in which the
protocluster clouds had characteristic sizes of $0.9 \pm 0.1$ pc and SFEs of
$0.3 \pm 0.07$. The colors and luminosities of the M104 clusters show the
clearly defined classic bimodal form. The blue sequence exhibits a
mass/metallicity relation (MMR), following a scaling of heavy-element abundance
with luminosity of $Z \sim L^{0.3}$ very similar to what has been found in most
giant elliptical galaxies. A quantitative self-enrichment model provides a good
first-order match to the data for the same initial SFE and protocluster size
that were required to explain the SDF. We also discuss various forms of the
globular cluster Fundamental Plane (FP) of structural parameters, and show that
useful tests of it can be extended to galaxies beyond the Local Group.
