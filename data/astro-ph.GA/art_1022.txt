M31 pixel lensing: Observations at the Loiano telescope
We discuss pixel lensing observations towards M31 carried out at the Loiano
telescope. We have established a fully automatic pipeline for the detection and
the characterization of microlensing events. We have evaluated the efficiency
of the pipeline. We have estimated the expected signal by means of a Monte
Carlo simulation. As a result we select 2 microlensing candidates. This is
compatible with the expected M31 self-lensing signal. The small statistics of
events at disposal does not still allow us, however, to draw definite
conclusions on the content of compact halo objects.
