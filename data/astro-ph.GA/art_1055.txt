An X-ray Bright Nucleus in the Low Surface Brightness Galaxy UGC 6614
We report a study of the X-ray emission from the nuclear region of the low
surface brightness (LSB) galaxy UGC 6614. Very little is known about the
central objects in LSB galaxies especially their X-ray properties and X-ray
spectra. In this study we have used XMM-Newton archival data to study the
characteristics of the X-ray spectrum and the X-ray flux variability of the AGN
in the LSB galaxy UGC 6614. The nucleus of UGC 6614 is very bright in X-ray
emission with an absorption corrected 0.2-10.0 keV luminosity of ~1.1 x 10^{42}
erg s^{-1}. The X-ray spectrum is found to be power-law type with a moderate
column density. A short time scale of intensity variation and large X-ray flux
is indicative of the presence of a black hole at the centre of this galaxy.
Using the method of excess variance, we have determined the black hole mass to
be ~0.12 x 10^{6} solar mass. The X-ray spectral properties are similar to that
of the Seyfert I type AGNs. Our study thus demonstrates that although LSB
galaxies are poor in star formation, they may harbour AGNs with X-ray
properties comparable to that seen in more luminous spiral galaxies.
