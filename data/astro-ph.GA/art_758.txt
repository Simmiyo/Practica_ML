Dispersion of Magnetic Fields in Molecular Clouds. II
We expand our study on the dispersion of polarization angles in molecular
clouds. We show how the effect of signal integration through the thickness of
the cloud as well as across the area subtended by the telescope beam inherent
to dust continuum measurements can be incorporated in our analysis to correctly
account for its effect on the measured angular dispersion and inferred
turbulent to large-scale magnetic field strength ratio. We further show how to
evaluate the turbulent magnetic field correlation scale from polarization data
of sufficient spatial resolution and high enough spatial sampling rate. We
apply our results to the molecular cloud OMC-1, where we find a turbulent
correlation length of approximately 16 mpc, a turbulent to large-scale magnetic
field strength ratio of approximately 0.5, and a plane-of-the-sky large-scale
magnetic field strength of approximately 0.76 mG.
