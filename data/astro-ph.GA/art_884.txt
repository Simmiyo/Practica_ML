Origin(s) of the Highly Ionized High-Velocity Clouds Based on Their
  Distances
Previous HST and FUSE observations have revealed highly ionized high-velocity
clouds (HVCs) or more generally low HI column HVCs along extragalactic
sightlines over 70-90% of the sky. The distances of these HVCs have remained
largely unknown hampering to distinguish a "Galactic" origin (e.g., outflow,
inflow) from a "Local Group" origin (e.g., warm-hot intergalactic medium). We
present the first detection of highly ionized HVCs in the Cosmic Origins
Spectrograph (COS) spectrum of the early-type star HS1914+7134 (l = 103, b=+24)
located in the outer region of the Galaxy at 14.9 kpc. Two HVCs are detected in
absorption at v_LSR = -118 and -180 km/s in several species, including CIV,
SiIV, SiIII, CII, SiII, OI, but HI 21-cm emission is only seen at -118 \km.
Within 17 degrees of HS1914+7134, we found HVC absorption of low and high ions
at similar velocities toward 5 extragalactic sight lines, suggesting that these
HVCs are related. The component at -118 km/s is likely associated with the
Outer Arm of the Milky Way. The highly ionized HVC at -180 km/s is an HVC
plunging at high speed onto the thick disk of the Milky Way. This is the second
detection of highly ionized HVCs toward Galactic stars, supporting a "Galactic"
origin for at least some of these clouds.
