Highly Ionized Envelopes of High Velocity Clouds
We present recent results on highly ionized gas in Galactic High-Velocity
Clouds (HVCs), originally surveyed in OVI (Sembach et al. 2003). In a new
FUSE/HST survey of SiII/III/IV (Shull et al. 2009) toward 37 AGN, we detected
SiIII (lambda 1206.500 A) absorption with a sky coverage fraction 81 +/- 5% (61
HVCs along 30 of 37 high-latitude sight lines). The SiIII (lambda 1206.500 A)
line is typically 4-5 times stronger than OVI (lambda 1031.926 A). The mean HVC
column density of perhaps 10^19 cm^-2 of low-metallicity (0.1 - 0.2 Z_sun)
ionized gas in the low halo. Recent determinations of HVC distances allow us to
estimate a total reservoir of ~10^8 M_sun. Estimates of infall velocities
indicate an infall rate of around 1 M_sun yr^-1, comparable to the
replenishment rate for star formation in the disk. HVCs appear to be sheathed
by intermediate-temperature gas (10^4.0 - 10^4.5 K) detectable in SiIII and
SiIV, as well as hotter gas seen in OVI and other high ions. To prepare for HST
observations of 10 HVC-selected sight lines with the Cosmic Origins
Spectrograph (COS), we compile FUSE/STIS spectra of these ions, plus FeIII,
CIII, CIV, and SIV. Better constraints on the physical properties of HVC
envelopes and careful treatment of HVC kinematics and infall rates should come
from high-quality (S/N ~ 30-40) COS data.
