A systematic fitting scheme for caustic-crossing microlensing events
We outline a method for fitting binary-lens caustic-crossing microlensing
events based on the alternative model parameterisation proposed and detailed in
Cassan (2008). As an illustration of our methodology, we present an analysis of
OGLE-2007-BLG-472, a double-peaked Galactic microlensing event with a source
crossing the whole caustic structure in less than three days. In order to
identify all possible models we conduct an extensive search of the parameter
space, followed by a refinement of the parameters with a Markov Chain-Monte
Carlo algorithm. We find a number of low-chi2 regions in the parameter space,
which lead to several distinct competitive best models. We examine the
parameters for each of them, and estimate their physical properties. We find
that our fitting strategy locates several minima that are difficult to find
with other modelling strategies and is therefore a more appropriate method to
fit this type of events.
