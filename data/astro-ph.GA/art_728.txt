A Universal Vertical Stellar Density Distribution Law for the Galaxy
We reduced the observational logarithmic space densities in the vertical
direction up to 8 kpc from the galactic plane, for stars with absolute
magnitudes (5,6], (6,7] and [5,10] in the fields $#$0952+5245 and SA114, to a
single exponential density law. One of three parameters in the quadratic
expression of the density law corresponds to the local space density for stars
with absolute magnitudes in question. There is no need of any definition for
scaleheights or population types. We confirm with the arguments of non-discrete
thin and thick discs for our Galaxy and propose a single structure up to
several kiloparsecs from the galactic plane. The logarithmic space densities
evaluated by this law for the ELAIS field fit to the observational ones.
Whereas, there are considerable offsets for the logarithmic space densities
produced by two sets of classical galactic model parameters from the
observational ones, for the same field.
