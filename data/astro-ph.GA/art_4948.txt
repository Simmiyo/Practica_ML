Imaging polarimetry of the rotating Bok globule CB67
Polarimetric observations of about 50 stars located in a close vicinity of
the Bok globule CB67 having significantly nonspherical shape and rapid rotation
are performed. The data obtained are compared with the available observations
of this globule at radio and submillimeter wavelengths as well as some
theoretical calculations. It is found that the elongation and the rotation
moment of CB67 are oriented rather perpendicular to the magnetic fields, which
is unusual for Bok globules and is difficult to be explained from the
theoretical point of view.
