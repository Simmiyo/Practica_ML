Galactic Nuclei Formation Via Globular Cluster Merging
Preliminary results are presented about a fully self-consistent N-body
simulation of a sample of four massive globular clusters in close interaction
within the central region of a galaxy. The N-body representation (with
N=1.5x10^6 particles in total) of both the clusters and the galaxy allows to
include in a natural and self-consistent way dynamical friction and tidal
interactions. The results confirm the decay and merging of globulars as a
viable scenario for the formation/accretion of compact nuclear clusters.
Specifically: i) the frictional orbital decay is about 2 times faster than that
predicted by the generalized Chandrasekhar formula; ii) the progenitor clusters
merge in less than 20 galactic core-crossing times; iii) the NC configuration
keeps quasi-stable at least within 70 galactic core-crossing times.
