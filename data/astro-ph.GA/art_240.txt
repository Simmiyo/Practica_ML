Exploring the Partially-obscured BLR and Partially-covered NLR
We have conducted a series of investigations on the geometry of the reddening
material in AGNs, which have important implications to the AGN unification and
SMBH demography. According to our statistics of partially obscured quasars, we
found that SMBHs in partially obscured type/phase (i.e., intermediate type) are
at least as abundant as normal quasars in the local Universe; the reddening
material in most objects are located in between the BLR and NLR. According to
our comparison of narrow lines in type 1 and 2 AGNs, we found that for
high-ionization or high-critical density narrow lines (e.g. OIII 5007, Balmer
lines and FeII) a significant fraction of the emission arises from the inner
dense part of the NLR; this inner NLR is located very close to the central
engine and thus can be covered by the torus.
