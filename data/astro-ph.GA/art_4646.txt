The Supernova-ISM/Star formation Interplay
Supernovae are the most energetic stellar events and influence the
interstellar medium by their gasdynamics and energetics. By this, both also
affect the star formation positively and negatively. In this paper, we review
the complexity of investigations aiming at understanding the interchange
between supernova explosions with the star-forming molecular clouds. Commencing
from analytical studies the paper advances to numerical models of supernova
feedback from superbubble scales to galaxy structure. We also discuss
parametrizations of star-formation and supernova-energy transfer efficiencies.
Since evolutionary models from the interstellar medium to galaxies are numerous
and are applying multiple recipes of these parameters, only a representative
selection of studies can be discussed here.
