Dynamical mass segregation on a very short timescale
We discuss the observations and theory of star cluster formation to argue
that clusters form dynamically cool (subvirial) and with substructure. We then
perform an ensemble of simulations of cool, clumpy (fractal) clusters and show
that they often dynamically mass segregate on timescales far shorter than
expected from simple models. The mass segregation comes about through the
production of a short-lived, but very dense core. This shows that in clusters
like the Orion Nebula Cluster the stars >4 Msun can dynamically mass segregate
within the current age of the cluster. Therefore, the observed mass segregation
in apparently dynamically young clusters need not be primordial, but could be
the result of rapid and violent early dynamical evolution.
