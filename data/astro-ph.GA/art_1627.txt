The dynamical evolution of very-low mass binaries in open clusters
Very low-mass binaries (VLMBs), with system masses <0.2 Msun appear to have
very different properties to stellar binaries. This has led to the suggestion
that VLMBs form a distinct and different population. As most stars are born in
clusters, dynamical evolution can significantly alter any initial binary
population, preferentially destroying wide binaries. In this paper we examine
the dynamical evolution of initially different VLMB distributions in clusters
to investigate how different the initial and final distributions can be.
  We find that the majority of the observed VLMB systems, which have
separations <20 au, cannot be destroyed in even the densest clusters.
Therefore, the distribution of VLMBs with separations <20 au now must have been
the birth population (although we note that the observations of this population
may be very incomplete). Most VLMBs with separations >100 au can be destroyed
in high-density clusters, but are mainly unaffected in low-density clusters.
Therefore, the initial VLMB population must contain many more binaries with
these separations than now, or such systems must be made by capture during
cluster dissolution. M-dwarf binaries are processed in the same way as VLMBs
and so the difference in the current field populations either points to
fundamentally different birth populations, or significant observational
incompleteness in one or both samples.
