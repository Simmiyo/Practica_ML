Herschel observations of extra-ordinary sources: Detection of Hydrogen
  Fluoride in absorption towards Orion~KL
We report a detection of the fundamental rotational transition of hydrogen
fluoride in absorption towards Orion KL using Herschel/HIFI. After the removal
of contaminating features associated with common molecules ("weeds"), the HF
spectrum shows a P-Cygni profile, with weak redshifted emission and strong
blue-shifted absorption, associated with the low-velocity molecular outflow. We
derive an estimate of 2.9 x 10^13 cm^-2 for the HF column density responsible
for the broad absorption component. Using our best estimate of the H2 column
density within the low-velocity molecular outflow, we obtain a lower limit of
~1.6 x 10^-10 for the HF abundance relative to hydrogen nuclei, corresponding
to 0.6% of the solar abundance of fluorine. This value is close to that
inferred from previous ISO observations of HF J=2--1 absorption towards Sgr B2,
but is in sharp contrast to the lower limit of 6 x 10^-9 derived by Neufeld et
al. (2010) for cold, foreground clouds on the line of sight towards G10.6-0.4.
