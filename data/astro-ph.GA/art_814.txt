G 112-29 (=NLTT 18149), a Very Wide Companion to GJ 282 AB with a Common
  Proper Motion, Common Parallax, Common Radial Velocity and Common Age
We have made a search for common proper motion (CPM) companions to the wide
binaries in the solar vicinity. We found that the binary GJ 282AB has a very
distant CPM companion (NLTT 18149) at a separation $s=1.09 \arcdeg$. Improved
spectral types and radial velocities are obtained, and ages determined for the
three components. The Hipparcos trigonometric parallaxes and the new radial
velocities and ages turn out to be very similar for the three stars, and
provide strong evidence that they form a physical system. At a projected
separation of 55733AU from GJ 282AB, NLTT 18149 ranks among the widest physical
companions known.
