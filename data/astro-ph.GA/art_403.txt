Resolving the molecular environment of Super Star Clusters in Henize
  2-10
The rate of star formation both in the Galaxy and in external galaxies should
be related to the physical properties of the molecular clouds from which stars
form. This is expected for the starbursts found both in irregular galaxies and
in some mergers. The dwarf galaxy Henize 2-10 is particularly interesting in
this context as it shows a number of newly formed Super Star Clusters (SSCs)
associated with a very rich molecular environment. We present a high angular
resolution study of the molecular gas associated with the SSCs with the aim of
deriving the physical properties of the parent molecular clouds. The final goal
is to test the expectation that the formation of SSCs requires exceptionally
dense and massive clouds. We have used the Submillimeter Array with an angular
resolution of 1.9 X 1.3 to map the J=2-1 transition of CO in Henize 2-10.
Supplementary measurements of HCN(J=1-0), 13CO(J=2-1) and millimeter continuum
were obtained with the APEX, IRAM-30m and SEST single dish telescopes. Our
single dish observations confirm the association of the newly formed SSCs in
Henize 2-10 with dense molecular gas. Our interferometric observations resolve
the CO(2-1) emission in several giant molecular clouds. Overall the molecular
gas accounts for approximately half of the mass in the central regions of
Henize 2-10. Although we find indications that the molecular clouds associated
with the formation of SSCs in Henize 2-10 are massive and dense, the tracer we
used (CO) and the linear resolution of our observations (60 X 80 pc) are still
not adequate to test the expectation that exceptionally dense and massive cores
are required for SSCs formation.
