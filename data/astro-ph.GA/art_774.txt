The Effect of Tidal Stripping on Composite Stellar Populations in Dwarf
  Spheroidal Galaxies
We use N-body simulations to study the effects of tides on the kinematical
structure of satellite galaxies orbiting a Milky Way-like potential. Our work
is motivated by observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the Local Group,
for which often a distinction is possible between a cold centrally concentrated
metal rich and a hot, extended metal poor population. We find that an important
attenuation of the initial differences in the distribution of the two stellar
components occurs for orbits with small pericentric radii (r_per < 20 kpc).
This is mainly due to: i) the loss of the gravitational support provided by the
dark matter component after tidal stripping takes place, which forces a
re-configuration of the luminous components, and ii) tides preferentially
affect the more extended stellar component, leading to a net decrease in its
velocity dispersion as a response for the mass loss, which thus shrinks the
kinematical gap. We apply these ideas to the Sculptor and Carina dwarf
spheroidals. Differences in their orbits might help to explain, under the
assumption of similar initial configurations, why in the former a clear
kinematical separation between metal poor and metal rich stars is apparent,
while in Carina this segregation is significantly more subtle.
