A reassessment of the kinematics of PV Cephei based on accurate proper
  motion measurements
We present two Very Large Array observations of the pre-main-sequence star PV
Cephei, taken with a separation of 10.5 years. These data show that the proper
motions of this star are $\mu_\alpha \cos \delta = +10.9 \pm 3.0$ mas
yr$^{-1}$; $\mu_\delta = +0.2 \pm 1.8$ mas yr$^{-1}$, very similar to those
-previously known- of HD 200775, the B2Ve star that dominates the illumination
of the nearby reflection nebula NGC 7023. This result suggests that PV Cephei
is not a rapidly moving run-away star as suggested by previous studies. The
large velocity of PV Cephei had been inferred from the systematic eastward
displacement of the bisectors of successive pairs of Herbig Haro knots along
its flow. These systematic shifts might instead result from an intrinsic
dissymmetry in the ejection mechanisms, or from an asymmetric distribution of
the circumstellar material.
