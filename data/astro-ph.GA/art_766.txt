Large Eddy Simulations of Supersonic Turbulence
Based on ideas by Woodward et al., a subgrid scale model that is applicable
to highly compressible turbulence is presented. Applying the subgrid scale
model in large eddy simulations of forced supersonic turbulence, the bottleneck
effect is largely reduced and, thereby, approximate scaling laws can be
obtained at relatively low numerical resolution. In agreement with previous
results from PPM simulations without explicit subgrid scale model, it is found
that the energy spectrum function for the velocity field with fractional
density-weighing, rho^(1/3)u, varies substantially with the forcing, at least
for the decade of wavenumbers next to the energy-containing range.
Consequently, if universal scaling of compressible turbulence exists, it can be
found on length scales much smaller than the forcing scale only.
