The Origin of the Silicate Emission Features in the Seyfert 2 Galaxy,
  NGC 2110
The unified model of active galactic nuclei (AGN) predicts silicate emission
features at 10 and 18 microns in type 1 AGN, and such features have now been
observed in objects ranging from distant QSOs to nearby LINERs. More
surprising, however, is the detection of silicate emission in a few type 2 AGN.
By combining Gemini and Spitzer mid-infrared imaging and spectroscopy of NGC
2110, the closest known Seyfert 2 galaxy with silicate emission features, we
can constrain the location of the silicate emitting region to within 32 pc of
the nucleus. This is the strongest constraint yet on the size of the silicate
emitting region in a Seyfert galaxy of any type. While this result is
consistent with a narrow line region origin for the emission, comparison with
clumpy torus models demonstrates that emission from an edge-on torus can also
explain the silicate emission features and 2-20 micron spectral energy
distribution of this object. In many of the best-fitting models the torus has
only a small number of clouds along the line of sight, and does not extend far
above the equatorial plane. Extended silicate-emitting regions may well be
present in AGN, but this work establishes that emission from the torus itself
is also a viable option for the origin of silicate emission features in active
galaxies of both type 1 and type 2.
