GSH 91.5+2-114: A large HI shell in the outer part of the Galaxy
GSH91.5+2-114 is a large HI shell located in the outer Galaxy at a kinematic
distance of about 15 kpc. It was first identified in the Canadian Galactic
Plane Survey (CGPS) by Pineault et al. (2002) as being possibly associated with
objects possessing infrared colors which indicates strong stellar winds. The HI
shell has no obvious continuum counterpart in the CGPS radio images at 408 and
1420 MHz or in the IRAS images. We found no evidence for early-type massive
stars, most likely as a result of the large extinction that is expected for
this large distance. An analysis of the energetics and of the main physical
parameters of the HI shell shows that this shell is likely the result of the
combined action of the stellar winds and supernova explosions of many stars. We
investigate whether a number of slightly extended regions characterized by a
thermal radio continuum and located near the periphery of the HI shell could be
the result of star formation triggered by the expanding shell.
