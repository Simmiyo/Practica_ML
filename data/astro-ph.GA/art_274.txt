Gas infall towards Sgr A* from the clumpy circumnuclear disk
We present the first large-scale mosaic performed with the Submillimeter
Array (SMA) in the Galactic center. We have produced a 25-pointing mosaic,
covering a ~2' x 2' area around Sgr A*. We have detected emission from two
high-density molecular tracers, HCN(4-3) and CS(7-6), the latter never before
reported in this region. The data have an angular resolution of 4.6" x 3.1",
and the spectral window coverage is from -180 km/s to 1490 km/s for HCN(4-3)
and from -1605 km/s to 129 km/s for CS(7-6). Both molecular tracers present a
very clumpy distribution along the circumnuclear disk (CND), and are detected
with a high signal-to-noise ratio in the southern part of the CND, while they
are weaker towards the northern part. Assuming that the clumps are as close to
the Galactic center as their projected distances, they are still dense enough
to be gravitationally stable against the tidal shear produced by the
supermassive black hole. Therefore, the CND is a non-transient structure. This
geometrical distribution of both tracers suggests that the southern part of the
CND is denser than the northern part. Also, by comparing the HCN(4-3) results
with HCN(1-0) results we can see that the northern and the southern parts of
the CND have different excitation levels, with the southern part warmer than
the northern. Finally, we compare our results with those obtained with the
detection of NH3, which traces the warmer and less dense material detected in
the inner cavity of the CND. We suggest that we are detecting the origin point
where a portion of the CND becomes destabilized and approaches the dynamical
center of the Milky Way, possibly being impacted by the southern streamer and
heated on its way inwards.
