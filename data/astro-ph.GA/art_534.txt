Some orbits in various models of galactic gravitational field
We consider a gravitational field in steady state galaxy models of two kinds.
Some of them are axisymmetrical and others are triaxial. Equipotentials and
potential law are given separately in accordance to Kutuzov and Ossipkov
(1980). The relatively simple potential law is based on Kuzmin-Malasidze model
(1969). Two kinds of models contain four and five structural parameters
respectively. One composite model is suggested as well. Some examples of
trajectories are calculated in these models. The simplest method to describe
orbits is drawing their projections on coordinate planes. However it needs a
great amount of calculation and makes troubles in an interpretation of
information. In the case of axisymmetrical models a motion in co-moving
meridional plane (with cylindrical coordinates R, z) is considered as a common
way. In the case of triaxial models one can use three different co-moving
planes passing through moving star and corresponding coordinate axis. We
describe models in sections 2-4, calculated orbits are discussed in section 5.
