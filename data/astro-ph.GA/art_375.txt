From Protostars to Planetary Systems : FUV Spectroscopy of YSOs,
  Protoplanetary Disks, and Extrasolar Giant Planets
The last two decades have seen remarkable progress in our long-standing goal
of determining the abundance and diversity of worlds in the Galaxy.
Understanding of this subject involves tracing the path of interstellar
material from dense cloud cores, to young stellar objects, protoplanetary
disks, and finally extrasolar planets. Here we discuss the critical information
provided on these objects by point-source far-ultraviolet spectroscopy with a
large aperture, high resolution spectrograph of a large sample of unique
protostellar and protoplanetary objects that will leverage our existing
knowledge to lay out a path to new and powerful insight into the formation
process. We lay out a systematic case of coordinated observations that will
yield new knowledge about the process of assembly for both protostellar and
protoplanetary systems - that addresses specific uncertainties in our current
knowledge and takes advantage of potential new technologies to acquire the data
needed.
