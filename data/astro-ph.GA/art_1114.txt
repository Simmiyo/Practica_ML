Fermi Large Area Telescope observations of PSR J1836+5925
The discovery of the gamma-ray pulsar PSR J1836+5925, powering the formerly
unidentified EGRET source 3EG J1835+5918, was one of the early accomplishments
of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Sitting 25 degrees off the Galactic
plane, PSR J1836+5925 is a 173 ms pulsar with a characteristic age of 1.8
million years, a spindown luminosity of 1.1$\times10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and a
large off-peak emission component, making it quite unusual among the known
gamma-ray pulsar population. We present an analysis of one year of LAT data,
including an updated timing solution, detailed spectral results and a long-term
light curve showing no indication of variability. No evidence for a surrounding
pulsar wind nebula is seen and the spectral characteristics of the off-peak
emission indicate it is likely magnetospheric. Analysis of recent XMM
observations of the X-ray counterpart yields a detailed characterization of its
spectrum, which, like Geminga, is consistent with that of a neutron star
showing evidence for both magnetospheric and thermal emission.
