Unification of Luminous Type 1 Quasars through CIV Emission
Using a sample of 30,000 quasars from SDSS-DR7, we explore the range of
properties exhibited by high-ionization, broad emission lines, such as CIV
1549. Specifically we investigate the anti-correlation between L_UV and
emission line EQW (the Baldwin Effect) and the "blueshifting" of
high-ionization emission lines. The blueshift of the CIV emission line is
nearly ubiquitous, with a mean shift of 810 km/s for radio-quiet (RQ) quasars
and 360 km/s for radio-loud (RL) quasars, and the Baldwin Effect is present in
both RQ and RL samples. Composite spectra are constructed as a function of CIV
emission line properties in attempt to reveal empirical relationships between
different line species and the SED. Within a two-component disk+wind model of
the broad emission line region (BELR), where the wind filters the continuum
seen by the disk component, we find that RL quasars are consistent with being
dominated by the disk component, while BALQSOs are consistent with being
dominated by the wind component. Some RQ objects have emission line features
similar to RL quasars; they may simply have insufficient black hole (BH) spin
to form radio jets. Our results suggest that there could be significant
systematic errors in the determination of L_bol and BH mass that make it
difficult to place these findings in a more physical context. However, it is
possible to classify quasars in a paradigm where the diversity of BELR
parameters are due to differences in an accretion disk wind between quasars
(and over time); these differences are underlain primarily by the SED, which
ultimately must be tied to BH mass and accretion rate.
