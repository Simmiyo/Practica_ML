The ELM Survey. I. A Complete Sample of Extremely Low Mass White Dwarfs
We analyze radial velocity observations of the 12 extremely low-mass <0.25
Msol white dwarfs (WDs) in the MMT Hypervelocity Star Survey. Eleven of the 12
WDs are binaries with orbital periods shorter than 14 hours; the one
non-variable WD is possibly a pole-on system among our non-kinematically
selected targets. Our sample is unique: it is complete in a well-defined range
of apparent magnitude and color. The orbital mass functions imply that the
unseen companions are most likely other WDs, although neutron star companions
cannot be excluded. Six of the 11 systems with orbital solutions will merge
within a Hubble time due to the loss of angular momentum through gravitational
wave radiation. The quickest merger is J0923+3028, a g=15.7 ELM WD binary with
a 1.08 hr orbital period and a <130 Myr merger time. The chance of a supernova
Ia event among our ELM WDs is only 1%-7%, however. Three binary systems
(J0755+4906, J1233+1602, and J2119-0018) have extreme mass ratios and will most
likely form stable mass-transfer AM CVn systems. Two of these objects, SDSS
J1233+1602 and J2119-0018, are the lowest surface gravity WDs ever found; both
show Ca II absorption likely from accretion of circumbinary material. We
predict that at least one of our WDs is an eclipsing detached double WD system,
important for constraining helium core WD models.
