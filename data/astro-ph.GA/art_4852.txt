Stellar Signatures of AGN Jet Triggered Star Formation
To investigate feedback between relativistic jets emanating from Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and the stellar population of the host galaxy, we analyze
the long-term evolution of the galaxy-scale simulations by Gaibler et al.
(2012) of jets in massive, gas-rich galaxies at z ~ 2 - 3 and of stars formed
in the host galaxies. We find strong, jet-induced differences in the resulting
stellar populations of galaxies that host relativistic jets and galaxies that
do not, including correlations in stellar locations, velocities, and ages. Jets
are found to generate distributions of increased radial and vertical velocities
that persist long enough to effectively extend the stellar structure of the
host. The jets cause the formation of bow shocks that move out through the
disk, generating rings of star formation within the disk. The bow shock often
accelerates pockets of gas in which stars form, yielding populations of stars
with significant radial and vertical velocities, some of which have large
enough velocities to escape the galaxy. These stellar population signatures can
serve to identify past jet activity as well as jet-induced star formation.
