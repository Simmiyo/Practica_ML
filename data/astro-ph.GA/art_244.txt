Do high-velocity clouds form by thermal instability?
We examine the proposal that the HI "high-velocity" clouds (HVCs) surrounding
the Milky Way and other disc galaxies form by condensation of the hot galactic
corona via thermal instability. Under the assumption that the galactic corona
is well represented by a non-rotating, stratified atmosphere, we find that for
this formation mechanism to work the corona must have an almost perfectly flat
entropy profile. In all other cases the growth of thermal perturbations is
suppressed by a combination of buoyancy and thermal conduction. Even if the
entropy profile were nearly flat, cold clouds with sizes smaller than 10 kpc
could form in the corona of the Milky Way only at radii larger than 100 kpc, in
contradiction with the determined distances of the largest HVC complexes.
Clouds with sizes of a few kpc can form in the inner halo only in low-mass
systems. We conclude that unless even slow rotation qualitatively changes the
dynamics of a corona, thermal instability is unlikely to be a viable mechanism
for formation of cold clouds around disc galaxies.
