New knowledge of the Galactic magnetic fields
The magnetic fields of our Milky Way galaxy are the main agent for cosmic
rays to transport. In the last decade, much new knowledge has been gained from
measurements of the Galactic magnetic fields. In the Galactic disk, from the
RMs of a large number of newly discovered pulsars, the large-scale magnetic
fields along the spiral arms have been delineated in a much larger region than
ever before, with alternating directions in the arm and interarm regions. The
toroidal fields in the Galactic halo were revealed to have opposite directions
below and above the Galactic plane, which is an indication of an A0 mode dynamo
operating in the halo. The strength of large-scale fields obtained from pulsar
RM data has been found to increase exponentially towards the Galactic center.
Compared to the steep Kolmogorov spectrum of magnetic energy at small scales,
the large-scale magnetic fields show a shallow broken spatial magnetic energy
spectrum.
