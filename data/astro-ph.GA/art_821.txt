Towards a fully consistent Milky Way disc model: Part 1 The local model
  based on kinematic and photometric data
We present a fully consistent evolutionary disc model of the solar cylinder.
The model is based on a sequence of stellar sub-populations described by the
star formation history (SFR) and the dynamical heating law (given by the
age-velocity dispersion relation AVR). The combination of kinematic data from
Hipparcos and the finite lifetimes of main sequence (MS) stars enables us to
determine the detailed vertical disc structure independent of individual
stellar ages and only weakly dependent on the IMF. The disc parameters are
determined by applying a sophisticated best fit algorithm to the MS star
velocity distribution functions in magnitude bins. We find that the AVR is well
constrained by the local kinematics, whereas for the SFR the allowed range is
larger. A simple chemical enrichment model is included in order to fit the
local metallicity distribution of G dwarfs. In our favoured model A the power
law index of the AVR is 0.375 with a minimum and maximum velocity dispersion of
5.1 km/s and 25.0 km/s, respectively. The SFR shows a maximum 10 Gyr ago and
declines by a factor of four to the present day value of 1.5 M_sun/pc^2/Gyr. A
best fit of the IMF leads to power-law indices of -1.46 below and -4.16 above
1.72 M_sun avoiding a kink at 1 M_sun. An isothermal thick disc component with
local density of ~6% of the stellar density is included. A thick disc
containing more than 10% of local stellar mass is inconsistent with the local
kinematics of K and M dwarfs.
