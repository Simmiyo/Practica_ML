Imprints of feedback in young gasless clusters?
We present the results of N-body simulations in which we take the masses,
positions and velocities of sink particles from five pairs of hydrodynamical
simulations of star formation by Dale et al. (2012, 2013) and evolve them for a
further 10Myr. We compare the dynamical evolution of star clusters that formed
under the influence of mass-loss driven by photoionization feedback, to the
evolution of clusters that formed without feedback. We remove any remaining gas
and follow the evolution of structure in the clusters (measured by the
Q-parameter), half-mass radius, central density, surface density and the
fraction of bound stars. There is little discernible difference in the
evolution of clusters that formed with feedback compared to those that formed
without. The only clear trend is that all clusters which form without feedback
in the hydrodynamical simulations lose any initial structure over 10Myr,
whereas some of the clusters which form with feedback retain structure for the
duration of the subsequent N-body simulation. This is due to lower initial
densities (and hence longer relaxation times) in the clusters from Dale et al.
(2012, 2013) which formed with feedback, which prevents dynamical mixing from
erasing substructure. However, several other conditions (such as supervirial
initial velocities) also preserve substructure, so at a given epoch one would
require knowledge of the initial density and virial state of the cluster in
order to determine whether star formation in a cluster has been strongly
influenced by feedback.
