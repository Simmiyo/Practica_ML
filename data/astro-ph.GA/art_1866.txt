Correlation of Fermi photons with high-frequency radio giant pulses from
  the Crab pulsar
To constrain the giant pulse (GP) emission mechanism and test the model of
Lyutikov (2007) for GP emission, we have carried out a campaign of simultaneous
observations of the Crab pulsar at gamma-ray (Fermi) and radio (Green Bank
Telescope) wavelengths. Over 10 hours of simultaneous observations we obtained
a sample of 2.1x10^4 giant pulses, observed at a radio frequency of 9 GHz, and
77 Fermi photons, with energies between 100 MeV and 5 GeV. The majority of GPs
came from the interpulse (IP) phase window. We found no change in the GP
generation rate within 10-120 s windows at lags of up to +-40 min of observed
gamma-ray photons. The 95% upper limit for a gamma-ray flux enhancement in
pulsed emission phase window around all GPs is 4 times the average pulsed
gamma-ray flux from the Crab. For the subset of IP GPs, the enhancement upper
limit, within the IP emission window, is 12 times the average pulsed gamma-ray
flux. These results suggest that GPs, at least high-frequency IP GPs, are due
to changes in coherence of radio emission rather than an overall increase in
the magnetospheric particle density.
