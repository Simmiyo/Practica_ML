The Inner Envelope and Disk of L1527 Revealed: Gemini L'-band Scattered
  Light Imaging
We present high-resolution L'-band imaging of the inner scattered light
structure of Class 0 protostar L1527 IRS (IRAS 04368+2557) taken with the
Gemini North telescope. The central point-source like feature seen in Spitzer
Space Telescope IRAC images is resolved in the Gemini image into a compact
bipolar structure with a narrow dark lane in the center. Two scattered light
lobes are extended ~1.8" (200 AU) perpendicular to the direction of the outflow
and ~2.5" (350 AU) along the outflow axis; the narrow dark lane between the
scattered light lobes is ~0.45" (60 AU) thick. The observations are consistent
with our initial modeling of a bright inner cavity separated by a dark lane due
to extinction along the line of sight of the central protostar by the disk
(Tobin et al. 2008). The bright, compact scattered light might be due to
complex inner structure generated by the outflow, as suggested in our first
paper, or it may more likely be the upper layers of the disk forming from
infalling matter.
