Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the dwarf galaxy IC 10
Infrared observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope archive are used to
study the dust component of the interstellar medium in the IC~10 irregular
galaxy. Dust distribution in the galaxy is compared to the distributions of
H$\alpha$ and [SII] emission, neutral hydrogen and CO clouds, and ionizing
radiation sources. The distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)
in the galaxy is shown to be highly non-uniform with the mass fraction of these
particles in the total dust mass reaching 4%. PAHs tend to avoid bright HII
regions and correlate well with atomic and molecular gas. This pattern suggests
that PAHs form in the dense interstellar gas. We propose that the significant
decrease of the PAH abundance at low metallicity is observed not only globally
(at the level of entire galaxies), but also locally (at least, at the level of
individual HII regions). We compare the distribution of the PAH mass fraction
to the distribution of high-velocity features, that we have detected earlier in
wings of H$\alpha$ and SII lines, over the entire available galaxy area. No
conclusive evidence for shock destruction of PAHs in the IC~10 galaxy could be
found.
