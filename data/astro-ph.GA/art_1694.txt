High-resolution mapping of the physical conditions in two nearby active
  galaxies based on 12CO(1-0), (2-1) and (3-2) lines
We present a detailed analysis of high resolution observations of the three
lowest CO transitions in two nearby active galaxies, NGC4569 and NGC4826. The
CO(1-0) and (2-1) lines were observed with the Plateau de Bure Interferometer
and the CO(3-2) line with the Submillimeter Array. Combining these data allows
us to compare the emission in the three lines and to map the line ratios,
R21=I_{CO(2-1)}/I_{CO(1-0)} and R32=I_{CO(3-2)}/I_{CO(1-0)} at a resolution of
~2", i.e., a linear resolution of 160 pc for NGC4569 and 40 pc for NGC4826. In
both galaxies the emission in the three lines is similarly distributed
spatially and in velocity, and CO is less excited (R32<0.6) than in the
Galactic Center or the centers of other active galaxies studied so far.
According to a pseudo-LTE model the molecular gas in NGC4569 is cold and mainly
optically thick in the CO(1-0) and (2-1) lines; less than 50% of the gas is
optically thin in the CO(3-2) line. LVG modeling suggests the presence of an
elongated ring of cold and dense gas coinciding with the ILR of the stellar
bar. More excited gas is resolved in the circumnuclear disk of NGC4826.
According to our pseudo-LTE model this corresponds to warmer gas with a ~50% of
the CO(3-2) emission being optically thin. LVG modeling indicates the presence
of a semicircular arc of dense and cold gas centered on the dynamical center
and ~70 pc in radius. The gas temperature increases and its density decreases
toward the center. A near side/far side asymmetry noticeable in the CO, R32 and
Pa-alpha maps suggests that opacity effects play a role. Examining published CO
maps of nearby active galaxies we find similar asymmetries suggesting that this
could be a common phenomenon in active galaxies. These mainly qualitative
results open new perspectives for the study of active galaxies with the future
Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array.
