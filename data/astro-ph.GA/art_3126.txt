Kinematic groups beyond the Solar neighbourhood with RAVE
We analyse the kinematics of disc stars observed by the RAVE survey in and
beyond the Solar neighbourhood.We detect significant overdensities in the
velocity distributions using a technique based on the wavelet transform.We find
that the main local kinematic groups are large scale features, surviving at
least up to ~1 kpc from the Sun in the direction of anti-rotation, and also at
~700 pc below the Galactic plane.We also find that for regions located at
different radii than the Sun, the known groups appear shifted in the velocity
plane. For example, the Hercules group has a larger azimuthal velocity for
regions inside the Solar circle and a lower value outside. We have also
discovered a new group at (U, V) = (92,-22) km/s in the Solar neighbourhood and
confirmed the significance of other previously found groups. Some of these
trends detected for the first time are consistent with dynamical models of the
effects of the bar and the spiral arms. More modelling is required to
definitively characterise the non-axisymmetric components of our Galaxy using
these groups.
