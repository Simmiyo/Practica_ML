Constraining star cluster disruption mechanisms
Star clusters are found in all sorts of environments and their formation and
evolution is inextricably linked to the star formation process. Their eventual
destruction can result from a number of factors at different times, but the
process can be investigated as a whole through the study of the cluster age
distribution. Observations of populous cluster samples reveal a distribution
following a power law of index approximately -1. In this work we use M33 as a
test case to examine the age distribution of an archetypal cluster population
and show that it is in fact the evolving shape of the mass detection limit that
defines this trend. That is to say, any magnitude-limited sample will appear to
follow a dN/dt=1/t, while cutting the sample according to mass gives rise to a
composite structure, perhaps implying a dependence of the cluster disruption
process on mass. In the context of this framework, we examine different models
of cluster disruption from both theoretical and observational standpoints.
