The AMANOGAWA-2SB Galactic Plane Survey I: Data on the Galactic Equator
Using a waveguide-type sideband-separating receiver (2SB receiver) on the
Tokyo-NRO 60-cm telescope (renamed the AMANOGAWA telescope), we carried out
simultaneous observations in the 12CO(J = 2-1) and 13CO(J = 2-1) lines over the
Galactic plane l = 10-245 deg along b = 0 deg with a 3.75 arcmin grid. Using
the 12CO(J = 1-0) data of Dame et al. (2001), who used a beam size almost the
same as ours, we show 12CO(J = 2-1)/12CO(J = 1-0) and 13CO(J = 2-1)/12CO(J =
2-1) intensity ratios on the l-v map and the intensity correlations among the
three lines. As a result, a linear correlation between 12CO(J = 1-0) and 12CO(J
= 2-1) and a curve correlation between 12CO(J = 2-1) and 13CO(J = 2-1), as
produced by most of the data, are found. We investigate these correlations with
simple radiative transfer equations to ascertain a number of restrictions on
the physical quantities of molecular gas on a galactic scale.
