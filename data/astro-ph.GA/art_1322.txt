The Spitzer-IRAC Point Source Catalog of the Vela-D Cloud
This paper presents the observations of the Cloud D in the Vela Molecular
Ridge, obtained with the IRAC camera onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope at the
wavelengths \lambda = 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0 {\mu}m. A photometric catalog of point
sources, covering a field of approximately 1.2 square degrees, has been
extracted and complemented with additional available observational data in the
millimeter region. Previous observations of the same region, obtained with the
Spitzer MIPS camera in the photometric bands at 24 {\mu}m and 70 {\mu}m, have
also been reconsidered to allow an estimate of the spectral slope of the
sources in a wider spectral range. A total of 170,299 point sources, detected
at the 5-sigma sensitivity level in at least one of the IRAC bands, have been
reported in the catalog. There were 8796 sources for which good quality
photometry was obtained in all four IRAC bands. For this sample, a preliminary
characterization of the young stellar population based on the determination of
spectral slope is discussed; combining this with diagnostics in the
color-magnitude and color-color diagrams, the relative population of young
stellar objects in the different evolutionary classes has been estimated and a
total of 637 candidate YSOs have been selected. The main differences in their
relative abundances have been highlighted and a brief account for their spatial
distribution is given. The star formation rate has been also estimated and
compared with the values derived for other star forming regions. Finally, an
analysis of the spatial distribution of the sources by means of the two-point
correlation function shows that the younger population, constituted by the
Class I and flat-spectrum sources, is significantly more clustered than the
Class II and III sources.
