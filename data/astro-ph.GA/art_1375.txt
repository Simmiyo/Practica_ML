IC 3418: Star Formation in a Turbulent Wake
Galaxy Evolution Explorer observations of IC 3418, a low surface brightness
galaxy in the Virgo Cluster, revealed a striking 17 kpc UV tail of bright knots
and diffuse emission. H alpha imaging confirms that star formation is ongoing
in the tail. IC 3418 was likely recently ram pressure stripped on its first
pass through Virgo. We suggest that star formation is occurring in molecular
clouds that formed in IC 3418's turbulent stripped wake. Tides and ram pressure
stripping (RPS) of molecular clouds are both disfavored as tail formation
mechanisms. The tail is similar to the few other observed star-forming tails,
all of which likely formed during RPS. The tails' morphologies reflect the
forces present during their formation and can be used to test for dynamical
coupling between molecular and diffuse gas, thereby probing the origin of the
star forming molecular gas.
