Massive Young Stars in the Galactic Center
We summarize our latest observations of the nuclear star cluster in the
central parsec of the Galaxy with the adaptive optics assisted, integral field
spectrograph SINFONI on the ESO/VLT, which result in a total sample of 177 bona
fide early-type stars. We find that most of these Wolf Rayet (WR), O- and B-
stars reside in two strongly warped eccentric (<e> = 0.36+/-0.06) disks between
0.8" and 12" from SgrA*, as well as a central compact concentration (the S-star
cluster) centered on SgrA*. The later type B stars (mK>15) in the radial
interval between 0.8" and 12" seem to be in a more isotropic distribution
outside the disks. We observe a dearth of late-type stars in the central few
arcseconds, which is puzzling. The stellar mass function of the disk stars is
extremely top-heavy with a best fit power law of dN/dm~m^(-0.45+/-0.3). Since
at least the WR/O-stars were formed in situ in a single star formation event ~6
Myrs ago, this mass function probably reflects the initial mass function (IMF).
The mass functions of the S-stars inside 0.8" and of the early-type stars at
distances beyond 12" differ significantly from the disk IMF; they are
compatible with a standard Salpeter/Kroupa IMF (best fit power law of
dN/dm~m^(-2.15+/-0.3).
