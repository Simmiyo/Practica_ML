ATCA Detection of SiO Masers in the Inner Parsecs of the Galactic Center
We present sensitive Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) observations of
SiO masers in the inner parsecs of the Galactic center (GC). We detected five
SiO J=2-1, v=1 (86 GHz) masers in the innner 25 arcsec (1 pc) of the GC. All
the detected 86 GHz SiO masers are previously known SiO J=1-0, v=1 (43 GHz)
masers and associated with late-type stars. Eighteen 43 GHz SiO masers were
detected within 50 arcsec (2 pc) of Sagittarius A*. Among them, seven are
detected for the first time, which brings the total number of 43 GHz SiO masers
to 22 in this region.
