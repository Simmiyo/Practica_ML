Identification of New Near-Infrared DIBs in the Orion Nebula
Large organic molecules and carbon clusters are basic building blocks of
life, but their existence in the universe has not been confirmed beyond doubt.
A number of unidentified absorption features (arising in the diffuse
inter-stellar medium), usually called ``Diffuse Inter-stellar Bands (DIBs)'',
are hypothesized to be produced by large molecules. Among these,
buckminsterfullerene C_60 has gained much attention as a candidate for DIB
absorbers because of its high stability in space. Two DIBs at ~9577A and 9632A
have been reported as possible features of C_60^+. However, it is still not
clear how their existence depends on their environment. We obtained
high-resolution spectra of three stars in/around the Orion Nebula, to search
for any correlations of the DIB strength with carrier's physical conditions,
such as dust-abundance and UV radiation field. We find three DIBs at ~9017A,
9210A, and 9258A as additional C_60^+ feature candidates, which could support
this identification. These DIBs have asymmetric profiles similar to the longer
wavelength features. However, we also find that the relative strengths of DIBs
are close to unity and differ from laboratory measurements, a similar trend as
noticed for the 9577/9632 DIBs.
