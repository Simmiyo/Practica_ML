Hot Gas in the Galactic Thick Disk and Halo Near the Draco Cloud
This paper examines the ultraviolet and X-ray photons generated by hot gas in
the Galactic thick disk or halo in the Draco region of the northern hemisphere.
Our analysis uses the intensities from four ions, C IV, O VI, O VII, and O
VIII, sampling temperatures of ~100,000 to ~3,000,000 K. We measured the O VI,
O VII and O VIII intensities from FUSE and XMM-Newton data and subtracted off
the local contributions in order to deduce the thick disk/halo contributions.
These were supplemented with published C IV intensity and O VI column density
measurements. Our estimate of the thermal pressure in the O VI-rich thick
disk/halo gas, p_{th}/k = 6500^{+2500}_{-2600} K cm^{-3}, suggests that the
thick disk/halo is more highly pressurized than would be expected from
theoretical analyses. The ratios of C IV to O VI to O VII to O VIII,
intensities were compared with those predicted by theoretical models. Gas which
was heated to 3,000,000 K then allowed to cool radiatively cannot produce
enough C IV or O VI-generated photons per O VII or O VIII-generated photon.
Producing enough C IV and O VI emission requires heating additional gas to
100,000 < T < 1,000,000 K. However, shock heating, which provides heating
across this temperature range, overproduces O VI relative to the others.
Obtaining the observed mix may require a combination of several processes,
including some amount of shock heating, heat conduction, and mixing, as well as
radiative cooling of very hot gas.
