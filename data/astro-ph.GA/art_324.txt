Multiwavelength photometry in the Globular Cluster M2
We present a multiwavelength photometric analysis of the globular cluster M2.
The data-set has been obtained by combining high-resolution (HST/WFPC2 and ACS)
and wide-field (GALEX) space observations and ground based (MEGACAM-CFHT,
EMMI-NTT) images. The photometric sample covers the entire cluster extension
from the very central regions up to the tidal radius and beyond. It allows an
accurate determination of the cluster center of gravity and other structural
parameters derived from the star count density profile. Moreover we study the
BSS population and its radial distribution. A total of 123 BSS has been
selected, and their radial distribution has been found to be bimodal (highly
peaked in the center, decreasing at intermediate radii and rising outward), as
already found in a number of other clusters. The radial position of the minimum
of the BSS distribution is consistent with the radius of avoidance caused by
the dynamical friction of massive objects over the cluster age. We also
searched for gradients in the red giant branch (RGB) and the asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) populations. At the $2\sigma$ level we found an overabundance of
AGB stars within the core radius and confirmed the result of Sohn et al.(1996)
that the central region of M2 is bluer than the outer part. We show that the
latter is due to a deficit of very luminous RGB stars in the central region.
