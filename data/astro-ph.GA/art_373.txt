Observations of Polarized Dust Emission at Far-infrared through
  Millimeter Wavelengths
Interstellar polarization at far-infrared through millimeter wavelengths (0.1
- 1 mm) is primarily due to thermal emission from dust grains aligned with
magnetic fields. This mechanism has led to studies of magnetic fields in a
variety of celestial sources, as well as the physical characteristics of the
dust grains and their interaction with the field. Observations have covered a
diverse array of sources, from entire galaxies to molecular clouds and
proto-stellar disks. Maps have been generated on a wide range of angular
scales, from surveys covering large fractions of the sky, down to those with
arcsecond spatial resolution. Additionally, the increasing availability of
observations at multiple wavelengths in this band allows empirical tests of
models of grain alignment and cloud structure. I review some of the recent work
in this field, emphasizing comparisons of observations on multiple spatial
scales and at multiple wavelengths.
