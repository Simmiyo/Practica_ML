Disk formation during collapse of magnetized protostellar cores
In the context of star and planet formation, understanding the formation of
disks is of fundamental importance. Previous studies found that the magnetic
field has a very strong impact on the collapse of a prestellar cloud,
particularly in possibly suppressing the formation of a disk even for
relatively modest values of the magnetic intensity. Since observations infer
that cores have a substantial level of magnetization, this raises the question
of how disks form. However, most studies have been restricted to the case in
which the initial angle, $\alpha$, between the magnetic field and the rotation
axis equals 0$^\circ$. We explore and analyse the influence of non aligned
configurations on disk formation. We perform 3D ideal MHD, AMR numerical
simulations for various values of $\mu$, the ratio of the mass-to-flux to the
critical mass-to-flux, and various values of $\alpha$. We find that disks form
more easily as $\alpha$ increases from 0 to 90$^\circ$. We propose that as the
magnetized pseudo-disks become thicker with increasing $\alpha$, the magnetic
braking efficiency is lowered. We also find that even small values of $\alpha$
($\simeq$ 10-20$^\circ$) show significant differences with the alligned case.
Within the framework of ideal MHD and for our choice of initial conditions,
centrifugally supported disks cannot form for values of $\mu$ smaller than
$\simeq$3, if the magnetic field and the rotation axis are perpendicular, and
smaller than about $\simeq$5-10 when they are perfectly aligned.
