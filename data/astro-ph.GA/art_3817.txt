Automated measurements of diffuse interstellar bands in early-type star
  spectra Correlations with the Color Excess
Stellar spectroscopic surveys may bring useful statistical information on the
links between Diffuse Interstellar Bands (DIBs) and interstellar environment.
DIB databases can also be used as a complementary tool for locating
interstellar (IS) clouds. Our goal is to develop fully automated methods of DIB
measurements to be applied to extensive data from stellar surveys. We present a
method appropriate for early-type nearby stars, its application to
high-resolution spectra of 130 targets recorded with ESO FEROS spectrograph,
and comparisons with other determinations. Using a DIB average profile deduced
from the most reddened stars, we performed an automated fitting of a
combination of a smooth stellar continuum, the DIB profile, and, when
necessary, a synthetic telluric transmission. Measurements are presented for 16
DIBs in the optical domain that could be extracted automatically: 4726.8,
4762.6, 4963.9, 5780.4, 5797.1, 5849.8, 6089.8, 6196.0, 6203.0-6204.5, 6269.8,
6283.8, 6379.3, 6445.3, 6613.6, 6660.7, and 6699.3 {\AA}.
