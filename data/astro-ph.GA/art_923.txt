Direct evidence of dust growth in L183 from MIR light scattering
Theoretical arguments suggest that dust grains should grow in the dense cold
parts of molecular clouds. Evidence of larger grains has so far been gathered
in near/mid infrared extinction and millimeter observations. Interpreting the
data is, however, aggravated by the complex interplay of density and dust
properties (as well as temperature for thermal emission). We present new
Spitzer data of L183 in bands that are sensitive and insensitive to PAHs. The
visual extinction AV map derived in a former paper was fitted by a series of 3D
Gaussian distributions. For different dust models, we calculate the scattered
MIR radiation images of structures that agree agree with the AV map and compare
them to the Spitzer data. The Spitzer data of L183 show emission in the 3.6 and
4.5 micron bands, while the 5.8 micron band shows slight absorption. The
emission layer of stochastically heated particles should coincide with the
layer of strongest scattering of optical interstellar radiation, which is seen
as an outer surface on I band images different from the emission region seen in
the Spitzer images. Moreover, PAH emission is expected to strongly increase
from 4.5 to 5.8 micron, which is not seen. Hence, we interpret this emission to
be MIR cloudshine. Scattered light modeling when assuming interstellar medium
dust grains without growth does not reproduce flux measurable by Spitzer. In
contrast, models with grains growing with density yield images with a flux and
pattern comparable to the Spitzer images in the bands 3.6, 4.5, and 8.0 micron.
