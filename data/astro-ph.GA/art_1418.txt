Detection of hydrogen fluoride absorption in diffuse molecular clouds
  with Herschel/HIFI: a ubiquitous tracer of molecular gas
We discuss the detection of absorption by interstellar hydrogen fluoride (HF)
along the sight line to the submillimeter continuum sources W49N and W51. We
have used Herschel's HIFI instrument in dual beam switch mode to observe the
1232.4762 GHz J = 1 - 0 HF transition in the upper sideband of the band 5a
receiver. We detected foreground absorption by HF toward both sources over a
wide range of velocities. Optically thin absorption components were detected on
both sight lines, allowing us to measure - as opposed to obtain a lower limit
on - the column density of HF for the first time. As in previous observations
of HF toward the source G10.6-0.4, the derived HF column density is typically
comparable to that of water vapor, even though the elemental abundance of
oxygen is greater than that of fluorine by four orders of magnitude. We used
the rather uncertain N(CH)-N(H2) relationship derived previously toward diffuse
molecular clouds to infer the molecular hydrogen column density in the clouds
exhibiting HF absorption. Within the uncertainties, we find that the abundance
of HF with respect to H2 is consistent with the theoretical prediction that HF
is the main reservoir of gas-phase fluorine for these clouds. Thus, hydrogen
fluoride has the potential to become an excellent tracer of molecular hydrogen,
and provides a sensitive probe of clouds of small H2 column density. Indeed,
the observations of hydrogen fluoride reported here reveal the presence of a
low column density diffuse molecular cloud along the W51 sight line, at an LSR
velocity of ~ 24kms-1, that had not been identified in molecular absorption
line studies prior to the launch of Herschel.
