Dynamical stability of infinite homogeneous self-gravitating systems:
  application of the Nyquist method
We complete classical investigations concerning the dynamical stability of an
infinite homogeneous gaseous medium described by the Euler-Poisson system or an
infinite homogeneous stellar system described by the Vlasov-Poisson system
(Jeans problem). To determine the stability of an infinite homogeneous stellar
system with respect to a perturbation of wavenumber k, we apply the Nyquist
method. We first consider the case of single-humped distributions and show
that, for infinite homogeneous systems, the onset of instability is the same in
a stellar system and in the corresponding barotropic gas, contrary to the case
of inhomogeneous systems. We show that this result is true for any symmetric
single-humped velocity distribution, not only for the Maxwellian. If we
specialize on isothermal and polytropic distributions, analytical expressions
for the growth rate, damping rate and pulsation period of the perturbation can
be given. Then, we consider the Vlasov stability of symmetric and asymmetric
double-humped distributions (two-stream stellar systems) and determine the
stability diagrams depending on the degree of asymmetry. We compare these
results with the Euler stability of two self-gravitating gaseous streams.
Finally, we determine the corresponding stability diagrams in the case of
plasmas and compare the results with self-gravitating systems.
