The Nuclear Outflows and Feedback in the Seyfert 2 Galaxy Markarian 573
We present a study of outflow and feedback in the well-known Seyfert 2 galaxy
Markarian 573 using high angular resolution long-slit spectrophotometry
obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). Through
analysis of the kinematics and ionization state of a biconical outflow region
emanating from the nucleus, we find that the outflow does not significantly
accelerate the surrounding host-galaxy interstellar gas and is too weak to be a
strong ionization mechanism in the extended emission regions. Instead, the
excitation of the extended regions is consistent with photoionization by the
active nucleus. From energetics arguments we show that the nuclear outflow is
slow and heavy and has a mechanical luminosity that is only ~1% of the
estimated bolometric luminosity of the system. The energy in the outflow is
able to mildly shape the gas in the extended regions but appears to be
insufficient to unbind it, or even to plausibly disrupt star formation. These
results are at odds with the picture of strong AGN feedback that has been
invoked to explain certain aspects of galaxy evolution.
