The beam topology and dynamic emission properties of pulsar B0943+10 --
  VI. Discovery of a 'Q'-mode precursor and comparison with pulsar B1822-09
This paper reports new observations of pulsars B0943+10 and B1822--09 carried
out with the Arecibo Observatory (AO) and the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope
(GMRT), respectively. Both stars exhibit two stable emission modes. We report
the discovery in B0943+10 of a highly linearly polarized precursor component
that occurs primarily in only one mode. This emission feature closely resembles
B1822-09's precursor which also occurs brightly in only one mode. B0943+10's
other mode is well known for its highly regular drifting subpulses that are
apparently produced by a rotating carousel system of 20 beamlets. Similary,
B1822-09 exhibits subpulse-modulation behavior only in the mode where its
precursor is absent. We survey our 18 hours of B0943+10 observations and find
that the sideband-modulation features, from which the carousel-rotation time
can be directly determined, occur rarely--less than 5% of the time--but always
indicating 20 beamlets. We present an analysis of B1822-09's modal modulation
characteristics at 325-MHz and compare them in detail with B0943+10. The pulsar
never seems to null, and we find a 43-rotation-period feature in the star's Q
mode that modulates the interpulse as well as the conal features in the main
pulse. We conclude that B1822-09 must have a nearly orthogonal geometry and
that its carousel circulation time is long compared to the modal sub-sequences
available in our observations, and the mainpulse/interpulse separation is
almost exactly 180 degrees. We conclude the precursors for both stars are
incompatible with core-cone emission. We assess the interesting suggestion by
Dyks et al. that downward-going radiation produces B1822-09's precursor
emission.
