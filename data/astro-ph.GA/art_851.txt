IPHAS and the symbiotic stars. II. New discoveries and a sample of the
  most common mimics
In a previous paper [arXiv:0712.2391], we presented the selection criteria
needed to search for symbiotic stars in IPHAS, the INT Halpha survey of the
Northern Galactic plane. IPHAS gives us the opportunity to make a systematic,
complete search for symbiotic stars in a magnitude-limited volume. Follow-up
spectroscopy at different telescopes worldwide of a sample of sixty two
symbiotic star candidates is presented. Seven out of nineteen S-type candidates
observed spectroscopically are confirmed to be genuine symbiotic stars. The
spectral type of their red giant components, as well as reddening and distance,
were computed by modelling the spectra. Only one new D-type symbiotic system,
out of forty-three candidates observed, was found. This was as expected (see
discussion in our paper on the selection criteria). The object shows evidence
for a high density outflow expanding at a speed larger than 65 km/s. Most of
the other candidates are lightly reddened classical T Tauri stars and more
highly reddened young stellar objects that may be either more massive young
stars of HAeBe type or classical Be stars. In addition, a few notable objects
have been found, such as three new Wolf-Rayet stars and two relatively
high-luminosity evolved massive stars. We also found a helium-rich source,
possibly a dense ejecta hiding a WR star, which is surrounded by a large
ionized nebula.
