Testing fundamental physics with distant star clusters: theoretical
  models for pressure-supported stellar systems
We investigate the mean velocity dispersion and the velocity dispersion
profile of stellar systems in MOND, using the N-body code N-MODY, which is a
particle-mesh based code with a numerical MOND potential solver developed by
Ciotti, Londrillo and Nipoti (2006). We have calculated mean velocity
dispersions for stellar systems following Plummer density distributions with
masses in the range of $10^4 M_\odot$ to $10^9 M_\odot$ and which are either
isolated or immersed in an external field. Our integrations reproduce previous
analytic estimates for stellar velocities in systems in the deep MOND regime
($a_i, a_e \ll a_0$), where the motion of stars is either dominated by internal
accelerations ($a_i \gg a_e$) or constant external accelerations ($a_e \gg
a_i$). In addition, we derive for the first time analytic formulae for the
line-of-sight velocity dispersion in the intermediate regime ($a_i \sim a_e
\sim a_0$). This allows for a much improved comparison of MOND with observed
velocity dispersions of stellar systems. We finally derive the velocity
dispersion of the globular cluster Pal 14 as one of the outer Milky Way halo
globular clusters that have recently been proposed as a differentiator between
Newtonian and MONDian dynamics.
