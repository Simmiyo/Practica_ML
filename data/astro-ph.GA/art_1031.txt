350 micron Polarimetry from the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory
We present a summary of data obtained with the 350 micron polarimeter, Hertz,
at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory. We give tabulated results and maps
showing polarization vectors and flux contours. The summary includes over 4300
individual measurements in 56 Galactic sources and 2 galaxies. Of these
measurements, 2153 have P >= 3\sigma_p statistical significance. The median
polarization of the entire data set is 1.46%.
