PHL 932: when is a planetary nebula not a planetary nebula?
The emission nebula around the subdwarf B (sdB) star PHL 932 is currently
classified as a planetary nebula (PN) in the literature. Based on a large body
of multi-wavelength data, both new and previously published, we show here that
this low-excitation nebula is in fact a small Stromgren sphere (HII region) in
the interstellar medium around this star. We summarise the properties of the
nebula and its ionizing star, and discuss its evolutionary status. We find no
compelling evidence for close binarity, arguing that PHL 932 is an ordinary sdB
star. We also find that the emission nebulae around the hot DO stars PG
0108+101 and PG 0109+111 are also Stromgren spheres in the ISM, and along with
PHL 932, are probably associated with the same extensive region of
high-latitude molecular gas in Pisces-Pegasus.
