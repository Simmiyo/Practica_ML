Abundance Patterns in the Interstellar Medium of the S0 Galaxy NGC 1316
  (Fornax A) Revealed with Suzaku
The Suzaku X-ray satellite observed the nearby S0 galaxy NGC 1316, a merger
remnant aged 3 Gyr. The total good exposure time was 48.7 ksec. The spectra
were well represented by a two-temperature thermal model for the interstellar
medium (ISM) plus a power-law model. The cool and hot temperatures of the
thermal model were 0.48 +/- 0.03 and 0.92 +/- 0.04 keV, respectively. The
excellent spectral sensitivity of Suzaku enables for the first time to measure
the metal abundances of O, Ne, Mg, Si, and Fe in the ISM. The resultant
abundance pattern of O, Ne, Mg, Si, and Fe is close to that of the new solar
abundance determined by Lodders (2003). The measured abundance pattern is
compared with those of elliptical galaxies and an S0 galaxy, observed with
Suzaku. Considering the metal-enrichment from present Type Ia supernovae, the
near-solar abundance pattern of the ISM in NGC~1316 indicates an enhanced
{\alpha}/Fe ratio of stellar materials in the entire galaxy, like in giant
elliptical galaxies.
