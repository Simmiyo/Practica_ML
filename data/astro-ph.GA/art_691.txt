Synthetic Observations of the HI Line in SPH-Simulated Spiral Galaxies
Using the radiative transfer code Torus, we produce spectral-line cubes of
the predicted HI profile from global SPH simulations of spiral galaxies. Torus
grids the SPH galaxy using Adaptive Mesh Refinement, then applies a ray-tracing
method to infer the HI profile along the line(s) of sight. The gridded galaxy
can be observed from any direction, which enables us to model the observed HI
profile for galaxies of any orientation. We can also place the observer inside
the galaxy, to simulate HI observations taken from the Earth's position in the
Milky Way.
