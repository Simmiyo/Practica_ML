The role of the Galactic bar in the chemical evolution of the Milky Way
In the absence of an interaction, central bars might be the most effective
mechanism for radial motions of gas in barred spiral galaxies, which represent
two-thirds of disc galaxies. The dynamical effects induced by bars in the first
few kpc of discs might play an important role in the disc profiles in this
region. In this work, a chemical evolution model with radial gas flows is
proposed in order to mimic the effects of the Milky Way bar in the bulge and
inner disc. The model is an update of a chemical evolution model with the
inclusion of radial gas flows in the disc and bulge. The exchange of gas
between the cylindrical concentric regions that form the Galaxy is modelled
considering the flows of gas from and to the adjacent cylindrical regions. The
most recent data for the bulge metallicity distribution are reproduced by means
of a single and longer bulge collapse time-scale (2 Gyr) than other chemical
evolution models predict. The model is able to reproduce the peak in the
present star formation rate at 4 kpc and the formation of the molecular gas
ring. The model with a bar predicts a flattening of the oxygen radial gradient
of the disc. Additionally, models with radial gas flows predict a higher star
formation rate during the formation of the bulge. This is in agreement with the
most recent observations of the star formation rate at the centre of massive
barred spiral galaxies.
