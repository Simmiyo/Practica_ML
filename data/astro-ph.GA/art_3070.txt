Physical properties of interstellar filaments
We analyze the physical parameters of interstellar filaments that we describe
by an idealized model of isothermal self-gravitating infinite cylinder in
pressure equilibrium with the ambient medium. Their gravitational state is
characterized by the ratio f_cyl of their mass line density to the maximum
possible value for a cylinder in a vacuum. Equilibrium solutions exist only for
f_cyl < 1. This ratio is used in providing analytical expressions for the
central density, the radius, the profile of the column density, the column
density through the cloud centre, and the fwhm. The dependence of the physical
properties on external pressure and temperature is discussed and directly
compared to the case of pressure-confined isothermal self-gravitating spheres.
  Comparison with recent observations of the fwhm and the central column
density N_H(0) show good agreement and suggest a filament temperature of ~10 K
and an external pressure p_ext/k in the range 1.5x10^4 K/cm^3 to 5x10^4 K/cm^3.
  Stability considerations indicate that interstellar filaments become
increasingly gravitationally unstable with mass line ratio f_cyl approaching
unity. For intermediate f_cyl>0.5 the instabilities should promote core
formation through compression, with a separation of about five times the fwhm.
We discuss the nature of filaments with high mass line densities and their
relevance to gravitational fragmentation and star formation.
