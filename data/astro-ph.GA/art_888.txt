The Distance to NGC 5128 (Centaurus A)
In this paper we review the various high precision methods that are now
available to determine the distance to NGC 5128. These methods include:
Cepheids, TRGB (tip of the red giant branch), PNLF (planetary nebula luminosity
function), SBF (surface brightness fluctuations) and Long Period Variable (LPV)
Mira stars. From an evaluation of these methods and their uncertainties, we
derive a best-estimate distance of 3.8 +- 0.1 Mpc to NGC 5128 and find that
this mean is now well supported by the current data. We also discuss the role
of NGC 5128 more generally for the extragalactic distance scale as a testbed
for the most direct possible comparison among these key methods.
