Intrinsic Shapes of Elliptical Galaxies
Tests for the intrinsic shape of the luminosity distribution in elliptical
galaxies are discussed, with an emphasis on the uncertainties. Recent
determinations of the ellipticity frequency function imply a paucity of nearly
spherical galaxies, and may be inconsistent with the oblate hypothesis.
Statistical tests based on the correlation of surface brightness, isophotal
twisting, and minor axis rotation with ellipticity have so far not provided
strong evidence in favor of the nearly oblate or nearly prolate hypothesis, but
are at least qualitatively consistent with triaxiality. The possibility that
the observed deviations of elliptical galaxy isophotes form ellipses are due to
projection effects is evaluated. Dynamical instabilities may explain the
absence of elliptical galaxies flatter than about E6, and my also play a role
in the lack of nearly-spherical galaxies.
