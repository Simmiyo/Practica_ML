Unveiling the circumstellar environment towards a massive young stellar
  object
As a continuation of a previous work, in which we found strong evidence of
massive molecular outflows towards a massive star forming site, we present a
new study of this region based on very high angular resolution observations
with the aim of discovering the outflow driven mechanism. Using near-IR data
acquired with Gemini-NIRI at the broad H- and Ks-bands, we study a region of
22" x 22" around the UCHII region G045.47+0.05, a massive star forming site at
the distance of about 8 kpc. To image the source with the highest spatial
resolution possible we employed the adaptative optic system ALTAIR, achieving
an angular resolution of about 0.15". We discovered a cone-like shape nebula
with an opening angle of about 90 degree extending eastwards the IR source
2MASS J19142564+1109283, a very likely MYSO. This morphology suggests a cavity
that was cleared in the circumstellar material and its emission may arise from
scattered continuum light, warm dust, and likely emission lines from
shock-excited gas. The nebula, presenting arc-like features, is connected with
the IR source through a jet-like structure, which is aligned with the blue
shifted CO outflow found in a previous study. The near-IR structure lies ~3"
north of the radio continuum emission, revealing that it is not spatially
coincident with the UCHII region. The observed morphology and structure of the
near-IR nebula strongly suggest the presence of a precessing jet. In this study
we have resolved the circumstellar ambient (in scale of a thousand A.U.) of a
distant MYSO, indeed one of the farthest cases.
