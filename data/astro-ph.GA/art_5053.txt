YSO search toward the boundary of the Central Molecular Zone with
  near-infrared polarimetry
We have carried out near-infrared polarimetry toward the boundary of the
Central Molecular Zone, in the field of (-1.4 deg $\lesssim l \lesssim$ -0.3
deg and 1.0 deg $\lesssim l \lesssim$ 2.9 deg, $|b|\lesssim$ 0.1 deg), using
the near-infrared polarimetric camera SIRPOL on the 1.4 m Infrared Survey
Facility telescope. We have selected 112 intrinsically polarized sources on the
basis of the estimate of interstellar polarization on Stokes $Q/I-U/I$ planes.
The selected sources are brighter than $K_S=14.5$ mag and have polarimetric
uncertainty $\delta P<1\,%$. Ten of these distinctive polarized sources are fit
well with spectral energy distributions of young stellar objects when using the
photometry in the archive of the Spitzer Space Telescope mid-infrared data.
However, many sources have spectral energy distributions of normal stars
suffering heavy interstellar extinction; these might be stars behind dark
clouds. Due to the small number of distinctive polarized sources and candidates
of young stellar object, we cannot judge if there is a decline of them outside
the Central Molecular Zone. Many of massive candidates of young stellar object
in the literature have only small intrinsic polarization. This might suggest
that their masses are 4-15 M$_{{\rm sun}}$, whose intrinsic polarization has
been expected to be small.
