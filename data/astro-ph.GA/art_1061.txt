Composition of the galactic center star cluster
We present a population analysis of the nuclear stellar cluster of the Milky
Way based on adaptive optics narrow band spectral energy distributions. We find
strong evidence for the lack of a stellar cusp and a similarity of the late
type luminosity function to the bulge KLF.
