The impact of X-rays on molecular cloud fragmentation and the IMF
Star formation is regulated through a variety of feedback processes. In this
study, we treat feedback by X-rays and discuss its implications. Our aim is to
investigate whether star formation is significantly affected when a star
forming cloud resides in the vicinity of a strong X-ray source. We perform an
Eulerian grid simulation with embedded Lagrangian sink particles of a
collapsing molecular cloud near a massive, 10^7 M_o black hole. The chemical
and thermal changes caused by radiation are incorporated into the FLASH code.
When there is strong X-ray feedback the star forming cloud fragments into
larger clumps whereby fewer but more massive protostellar cores are formed.
Competitive accretion has a strong impact on the mass function and a near-flat,
non-Salpeter IMF results.
