An OSIRIS study of the gas kinematics in a sample of UV-selected
  galaxies: Evidence of "Hot and Bothered" starbursts in the local Universe
We present data from Integral Field Spectroscopy for 3 supercompact
UV-Luminous Galaxies (ScUVLGs). As nearby (z~0.2), compact (R_50~1-2 kpc),
bright Paschen-alpha sources, with unusually high star formation rates
(SFR=3-100 M_sun/yr), ScUVLGs are an ideal population for studying detailed
kinematics and dynamics in actively star-forming galaxies. In addition, ScUVLGs
appear to be excellent analogs to high redshift Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) and
our results may offer additional insight into the dynamics of LBGs. Previous
work by our team has shown that the morphologies of these galaxies exhibit
tidal features and companions, and in this study we find that the dynamics of
ScUVLGs are dominated by disturbed kinematics of the emission line gas--
suggestive that these galaxies have undergone recent feedback, interactions or
mergers. While 2 of the 3 galaxies do display rotation, v/sigma < 1 --
suggesting dispersion dominated kinematics rather than smooth rotation. We also
simulate how these observations would appear at z~2. Lower resolution and loss
of low surface brightness features causes some apparent discrepancies between
the low-z (observed) and high-z (simulated) interpretations and quantitatively
gives different values for v/sigma, yet simulations of these low-z analogs
manage to detect the brightest regions well and resemble actual high-z
observations of LBGs.
