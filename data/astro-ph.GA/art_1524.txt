Mass and Magnetic distributions in Self Gravitating Super Alfvenic
  Turbulence with AMR
In this work, we present the mass and magnetic distributions found in a
recent Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) MHD simulation of supersonic, \sa, self
gravitating turbulence. Powerlaw tails are found in both volume density and
magnetic field probability density functions, with $P(\rho) \propto
\rho^{-1.67}$ and $P(B)\propto B^{-2.74}$. A power law is also found between
magnetic field strength and density, with $B\propto \rho^{0.48}$, throughout
the collapsing gas. The mass distribution of gravitationally bound cores is
shown to be in excellent agreement with recent observation of prestellar cores.
The mass to flux distribution of cores is also found to be in excellent
agreement with recent Zeeman splitting measurements.
