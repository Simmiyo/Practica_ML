The distinguishing factor for gravity models: stellar population
  synthesis
Alternative gravitations of Milgrom (MOND), Moffat (MOG), and CDM scenarios
all simulate rotation curves of spirals with reasonable details. They display
significant disparities however in predicting the stellar mass-to-light
($M_*/L$) ratios of the galaxies. We maintain this feature could serve as a
distinguishing factor between different alternative theories. We analyze the
rotation curves of 46 low- and high-surface brightness galaxies and compare the
resulting $M_*/L$s with the predictions of the Stellar Population Synthesis
(SPS) scheme. The color-$M_*/L$ correlation obtained for MOND is consistent
with predictions of SPS models. MOG does not show this consistency, and the
$M_*/L$s of CDM model shows large dispersions. Furthermore, $M_*/L$ ratios of
MOND with Bekenstein interpolating function favor Kroupa's initial mass
function (IMF) of the SPS scheme, while those of MOND with standard and simple
interpolating functions are consistent with Salpeter's IMF. Here is another
indication to differentiate between different IMFs that are used in SPS
context.
