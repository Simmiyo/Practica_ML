A deep view of the Monoceros ring in the Anticenter direction: clues of
  its extra-Galactic origin
We present the results of deep imaging obtained at the CFHT with MegaCam in
the Anticenter direction at two different heights above the Galactic disk. We
detect the presence of the Monoceros ring in both fields as a conspicuous and
narrow Main Sequence feature which dominates star counts over a large portion
of the color-magnitude diagram down to g'~24. The comparison of the morphology
and density of this feature with a large variety of Galactic models excludes
the possibility that it can be due to a flare of the Galactic disk, supporting
an extra-Galactic origin for this ring-like structure.
