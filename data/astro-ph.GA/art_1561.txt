Compact Binaries in Star Clusters II - Escapers and Detection Rates
We use a self-consistent Monte Carlo treatment of stellar dynamics to
investigate black hole binaries that are dynamically ejected from globular
clusters to determine if they will be gravitational wave sources. We find that
many of the ejected binaries have initially short periods and will merge within
a Hubble time due to gravitational wave radiation. Thus they are potential
sources for ground-based gravitational wave detectors. We estimate the yearly
detection rate for current and advanced ground-based detectors and find a
modest enhancement over the rate predicted for binaries produced by pure
stellar evolution in galactic fields. We also find that many of the ejected
binaries will pass through the longer wavelength Laser Interferometer Space
Antenna (LISA) band and may be individually resolvable. We find a low
probability that the Galaxy will contain a binary in the LISA band during its
three-year mission. Some such binaries may, however, be detectable at Mpc
distances implying that there may be resolvable stellar-mass LISA sources
beyond our Galaxy. We conclude that globular clusters have a significant effect
on the detection rate of ground-based detectors and may produce interesting
LISA sources in local group galaxies.
