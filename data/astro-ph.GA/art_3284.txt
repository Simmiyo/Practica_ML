Simulation Study of Dust-Scattered Far-Ultraviolet Emission in the
  Orion-Eridanus Superbubble
We present the results of dust scattering simulations carried out for the
Orion Eridanus Superbubble region by comparing them with observations made in
the far-ultraviolet. The albedo and the phase function asymmetry factor
(g-factor) of interstellar grains were estimated, as were the distance and
thickness of the dust layers. The results are as follows:
0.43$^{+0.02}_{-0.04}$ for the albedo and 0.45$^{+0.2}_{-0.2}$ for the
g-factor, in good agreement with previous determinations and theoretical
predictions. The distance of the assumed single dust layer, modeled for the
Orion Molecular Cloud Complex, was estimated to be ~110 pc and the thickness
ranged from ~130 at the core to ~50 pc at the boundary for the region of the
present interest, implying that the dust cloud is located in front of the
superbubble. The simulation result also indicates that a thin (~10 pc) dust
shell surrounds the inner X-ray cavities of hot gas at a distance of ~70-90 pc.
