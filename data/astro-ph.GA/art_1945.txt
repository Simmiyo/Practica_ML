Interstellar Turbulence
The Interstellar Medium (ISM) is a complex, multi-phase system, where the
history of the stars occurs. The processes of birth and death of stars are
strongly coupled to the dynamics of the ISM. The observed chaotic and diffusive
motions of the gas characterize its turbulent nature. Understanding turbulence
is crucial for understanding the star-formation process and the energy-mass
feedback from evolved stars. Magnetic fields, threading the ISM, are also
observed, making this effort even more difficult. In this work, I briefly
review the main observations and the characterization of turbulence from these
observable quantities. Following on, I provide a review of the physics of
magnetized turbulence. Finally, I will show the main results from theoretical
and numerical simulations, which can be used to reconstruct observable
quantities, and compare these predictions to the observations.
