A Search for Small-Scale Clumpiness in Dense Cores of Molecular Clouds
We have analyzed HCN(1-0) and CS(2-1) line profiles obtained with high
signal-to-noise ratios toward distinct positions in three selected objects in
order to search for small-scale structure in molecular cloud cores associated
with regions of high-mass star formation. In some cases, ripples were detected
in the line profiles, which could be due to the presence of a large number of
unresolved small clumps in the telescope beam. The number of clumps for regions
with linear scales of ~0.2-0.5 pc is determined using an analytical model and
detailed calculations for a clumpy cloud model; this number varies in the
range: ~2 10^4-3 10^5, depending on the source. The clump densities range from
~3 10^5-10^6 cm^{-3}, and the sizes and volume filling factors of the clumps
are ~(1-3) 10^{-3} pc and ~0.03-0.12. The clumps are surrounded by inter-clump
gas with densities not lower than ~(2-7) 10^4 cm^{-3}. The internal thermal
energy of the gas in the model clumps is much higher than their gravitational
energy. Their mean lifetimes can depend on the inter-clump collisional rates,
and vary in the range ~10^4-10^5 yr. These structures are probably connected
with density fluctuations due to turbulence in high-mass star-forming regions.
