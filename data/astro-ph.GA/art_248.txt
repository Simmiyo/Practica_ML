Can the Known Millisecond Pulsars Help in the Detection of
  Intermediate-Mass Black Holes at the Centers of Globular Clusters?
We consider the possibility of detecting intermediate-mass ($10^3-10^4
M_{\odot}$) black holes, whose existence at the centers of globular clusters is
expected from optical and infrared observations, using precise pulse arrival
timing for the millisecond pulsars in globular clusters known to date. For some
of these pulsars closest to the cluster centers, we have calculated the
expected delay times of pulses as they pass in the gravitational field of the
central black hole. The detection of such a time delay by currently available
instruments for the known pulsars is shown to be impossible at a black hole
mass of $10^3 M_{\odot}$ and very problematic at a black hole mass of $10^4
M_{\odot}$. In addition, the signal delay will have a negligible effect on the
pulsar periods and their first derivatives compared to the current accuracy of
their measurements.
