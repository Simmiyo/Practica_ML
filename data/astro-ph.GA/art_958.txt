I-GALFA: The Inner-Galaxy ALFA Low-Latitude H I Survey
The I-GALFA survey is mapping all the HI in the inner Galactic disk visible
to the Arecibo 305m telescope within 10 degrees of the Galactic plane
(longitudes of 32 to 77 deg at b=0 deg). The survey, which will obtain 1.3
million independent spectra, became possible with the installation of the
7-beam Arecibo L-Band Feed Array (ALFA) receiver in 2004. ALFA's 3.4 arcmin
resolution and tremendous sensitivity offer a great opportunity to observe the
fine details of HI in the Galaxy. The I-GALFA survey began in 2008 May and will
be completed in 2009 September. The data will be made publicly available when
the calibrated and gridded cubes are completed. Further information on the
I-GALFA project may be found at www.naic.edu/~galfa.
