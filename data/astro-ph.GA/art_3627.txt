More Remote Globular Clusters in the Outer Halo of M31
We searched the Sloan Digital Sky Survey for outer halo globular clusters
(GCs) around M31. Our search of non-stellar objects, within the limits 0.3 <
(g-i)o < 1.5 and 14.0 < ro < 19.0 concentrated in some remote areas of the
extended halo, to a maximum projected distance of 240 kpc, for a total of
approximately 200 square degrees. Another roughly 50 square degrees,
approximately 5-75 kpc from M31, were surveyed as test areas. In these areas,
we identified 39 GCs and 2 GC candidates, 84% of the previously known GCs (93%
of the "classical GCs" and 40% of the "halo extended clusters", on the cluster
classification scheme of Huxor et al.). For the entire survey, we visually
inspected 78,516 objects for morphological evidence of cluster status, and we
identified 18 new clusters, and 75 candidate clusters. The new clusters include
15 classical globulars and three clusters of lower density. Six of the clusters
reside in the remote areas of the outer halo, beyond projected distances of 100
kpc. Previously, only MGC1 was found beyond this limit at 117 kpc. The farthest
cluster discovered in this survey lies at a projected radius of 158 kpc from
M31, assuming that the M31 distance is 780 kpc.
