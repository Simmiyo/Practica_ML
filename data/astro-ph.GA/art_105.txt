Exploring the formation of spheroidal galaxies out to z~1.5 in GOODS
(Abridged) The formation of massive spheroidal galaxies is studied on a
visually classified sample of 910 galaxies extracted from the ACS/HST images of
the GOODS North and South fields (0.4<z<.5). Three key observables are
considered: comoving number density, internal colour distribution; and the
Kormendy relation. The comoving number density of the most massive galaxies is
found not to change significantly with redshift. One quarter of the whole
sample of early-types are photometrically classified as blue galaxies. On a
volume-limited subset out to z<0.7, the average stellar mass of the blue
ellipticals is 5E9Msun compared to 4E10Msun for red ellipticals. On a
volume-limited subsample of bright galaxies (Mv<-21) out to z=1.4 we find only
4% are blue early-types, in contrast with 26% for the full sample. The
intrinsic colour distribution correlates overall bluer colours with **blue
cores** (positive radial gradients of colour), suggesting an inside-out process
of formation. The redshift evolution of the observed colour gradients is
incompatible with a significant variaton in stellar age within each galaxy. The
slope of the Kormendy relation in the subsample of massive galaxies does not
change between z=0 and z=1.4.
