Magnetic Field Structure of the HH 1-2 Region: Near-Infrared Polarimetry
  of Point-Like Sources
The HH 1-2 region in the L1641 molecular cloud was observed in the near-IR J,
H, and Ks bands, and imaging polarimetry was performed. Seventy six point-like
sources were detected in all three bands. The near-IR polarizations of these
sources seem to be caused mostly by the dichroic extinction. Using a
color-color diagram, reddened sources with little infrared excess were selected
to trace the magnetic field structure of the molecular cloud. The mean
polarization position angle of these sources is about 111 deg, which is
interpreted as the projected direction of the magnetic field in the observed
region of the cloud. The distribution of the polarization angle has a
dispersion of about 11 deg, which is smaller than what was measured in previous
studies. This small dispersion gives a rough estimate of the strength of the
magnetic field to be about 130 microG and suggests that the global magnetic
field in this region is quite regular and straight. In contrast, the outflows
driven by young stellar objects in this region seem to have no preferred
orientation. This discrepancy suggests that the magnetic field in the L1641
molecular cloud does not dictate the orientation of the protostars forming
inside.
