The evolution of M 2-9 from 2000 to 2010
M 2-9, the Butterfly nebula, is an outstanding representative of extreme
aspherical flows. It presents unique features such as a pair of high-velocity
dusty polar blobs and a mirror-symmetric rotating pattern in the inner lobes.
Imaging monitoring of the evolution of the nebula in the past decade is
presented. We determine the proper motions of the dusty blobs, which infer a
new distance estimate of 1.3+-0.2 kpc, a total nebular size of 0.8 pc, a speed
of 147 km/s, and a kinematical age of 2500 yr. The corkscrew geometry of the
inner rotating pattern is quantified. Different recombination timescales for
different ions explain the observed surface brightness distribution. According
to the images taken after 1999, the pattern rotates with a period of 92+-4 yr.
On the other hand, the analysis of images taken between 1952 and 1977 measures
a faster angular velocity. If the phenomenon were related to orbital motion,
this would correspond to a modest orbital eccentricity (e=0.10+-0.05), and a
slightly shorter period (86+-5 yr). New features have appeared after 2005 on
the west side of the lobes and at the base of the pattern. The geometry and
travelling times of the rotating pattern support our previous proposal that the
phenomenon is produced by a collimated spray of high velocity particles (jet)
from the central source, which excites the walls of the inner cavity of M 2-9,
rather than by a ionizing photon beam. The speed of such a jet would be
remarkable: between 11000 and 16000 km/s. The rotating-jet scenario may explain
the formation and excitation of most of the features observed in the inner
nebula, with no need for additional mechanisms, winds, or ionization sources.
All properties point to a symbiotic-like interacting binary as the central
source of M 2-9.
