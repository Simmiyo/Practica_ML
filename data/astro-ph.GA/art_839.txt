Near infrared imaging of the cometary globule CG12
Cometary globule 12 is a relatively little investigated medium- and low mass
star forming region 210 pc above the Galactic plane. NIR J, H, and Ks imaging
and stellar photometry is used to analyse the stellar content and the structure
of CG 12. Several new members and member candidates of the CG 12 stellar
cluster were found. The new members include in particular a highly embedded
source with a circumstellar disk or shell and a variable star with a
circumstellar disk which forms a binary with a previously known A spectral type
cluster member. The central source of the known collimated molecular outflow in
CG 12 and an associated "hourglass"-shaped object due to reflected light from
the source were also detected. HIRES-enhanced IRAS images are used together
with SOFI J,H,Ks imaging to study the two associated IRAS point sources,
13546-3941 and 13547-3944. Two new 12 micrometer sources coinciding with NIR
excess stars were detected in the direction of IRAS 13546-3941. The IRAS
13547-3944 emission at 12 and 25 micrometers originates in the Herbig AeBe star
h4636n and the 60 and 100 micrometer emission from an adjacent cold source.
