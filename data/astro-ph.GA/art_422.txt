Mass Loss History of the AGB star, R Cas
We report here on the discovery of an extended far-infrared shell around the
AGB star, R Cassiopeia, made by AKARI and Spitzer. The extended, cold
circumstellar shell of R Cas spans nearly 3 arcmin and is probably shaped by
interaction with the interstellar medium. This report is one of several studies
of well-resolved mass loss histories of AGB stars under AKARI and Spitzer
observing programs labeled "Excavating Mass Loss History in Extended Dust
Shells of Evolved Stars (MLHES)".
