Supernova-driven interstellar turbulence and the galactic dynamo
The fractal shape and multi-component nature of the interstellar medium
together with its vast range of dynamical scales provides one of the great
challenges in theoretical and numerical astrophysics. Here we will review
recent progress in the direct modelling of interstellar hydromagnetic
turbulence, focusing on the role of energy injection by supernova explosions.
The implications for dynamo theory will be discussed in the context of the
mean-field approach. Results obtained with the test field-method are confronted
with analytical predictions and estimates from quasilinear theory. The
simulation results enforce the classical understanding of a turbulent Galactic
dynamo and, more importantly, yield new quantitative insights. The derived
scaling relations enable confident global mean-field modelling.
