VLT Kinematics for omega Centauri: Further Support for a Central Black
  Hole
The Galactic globular cluster omega Centauri is a prime candidate for hosting
an intermediate mass black hole. Recent measurements lead to contradictory
conclusions on this issue. We use VLT-FLAMES to obtain new integrated spectra
for the central region of omega Centauri. We combine these data with existing
measurements of the radial velocity dispersion profile taking into account a
new derived center from kinematics and two different centers from the
literature. The data support previous measurements performed for a smaller
field of view and show a discrepancy with the results from a large proper
motion data set. We see a rise in the radial velocity dispersion in the central
region to 22.8+-1.2 km/s, which provides a strong sign for a central black
hole. Isotropic dynamical models for omega Centauri imply black hole masses
ranging from 3.0 to 5.2x10^4 solar masses depending on the center. The
best-fitted mass is 4.7+-1.0x10^4 solar masses.
