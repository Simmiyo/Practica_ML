Time-Variable Accretion in the TW Hya Star/Disk System
We present two epochs of observations of TW Hya from the high-dispersion
near-IR spectrograph ARIES at the MMT. We detect strong emission from the
Brackett gamma transition of hydrogen, indicating an accretion rate
substantially larger than previously estimated using hydrogen line emission.
The Brackett gamma line-strength varies across our two observed epochs. We also
measure circumstellar-to-stellar flux ratios (i.e., veilings) that appear close
to zero in both epochs. These findings suggest that TW Hya experiences episodes
of enhanced accretion while the inner disk remains largely devoid of dust. We
discuss several physical mechanisms that may explain these observations.
