Studying Large and Small Scale Environments of Ultraviolet Luminous
  Galaxies
Studying the environments of 0.4<z<1.2 UV-selected galaxies, as examples of
extreme star-forming galaxies (with star formation rates in the range of 3-30
M_sol/yr), we explore the relationship between high rates of star-formation,
host halo mass and pair fractions. We study the large-scale and small-scale
environments of local Ultraviolet Luminous Galaxies (UVLGs) by measuring
angular correlation functions. We cross-correlate these systems with other
galaxy samples: a volume-limited sample (ALL), a Blue Luminous Galaxy sample
(BLG) and a Luminous Red Galaxy sample (LRG). We determine the UVLG comoving
correlation length to be r_0=4.8(+11.6/-2.4) h^-1 Mpc at <z> =1.0, which is
unable to constrain the halo mass for this sample. However, we find that UVLGs
form close (separation < 30 kpc) pairs with the ALL sample, but do not
frequently form pairs with LRGs. A rare subset of UVLGs, those with the highest
FUV surface brightnesses, are believed to be local analogs of high redshift
Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) and are called Lyman Break Analogs (LBAs). LBGs and
LBAs share similar characteristics (i.e., color, size, surface brightness,
specific star formation rates, metallicities, and dust content). Recent HST
images of z~0.2 LBAs show disturbed morphologies, signs of mergers and
interactions. UVLGs may be influenced by interactions with other galaxies and
we discuss this result in terms of other high star-forming, merging systems.
