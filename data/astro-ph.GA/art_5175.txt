Comparing the Host Galaxies of Type Ia, Type II and Type Ibc Supernovae
We compare the host galaxies of 902 supernovae, including SNe Ia, SNe II and
SNe Ibc, which are selected by cross-matching the Asiago Supernova Catalog with
the SDSS Data Release 7. We further selected 213 galaxies by requiring the
light fraction of spectral observations $>$15%, which could represent well the
global properties of the galaxies. Among them, 135 galaxies appear on the
Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich diagram, which allows us to compare the hosts in
terms of star-forming, AGNs (including composites, LINERs and Seyfert 2s) and
"Absorp" (their related emission-lines are weak or non-existence) galaxies. The
diagrams related to parameters D$_n$(4000), H$\delta_A$, stellar masses, SFRs
and specific SFRs for the SNe hosts show that almost all SNe II and most of SNe
Ibc occur in SF galaxies, which have a wide range of stellar mass and low
D$_n$(4000). The SNe Ia hosts as SF galaxies follow similar trends. A
significant fraction of SNe Ia occurs in AGNs and Absorp galaxies, which are
massive and have high D$_n$(4000). The stellar population analysis from
spectral synthesis fitting shows that the hosts of SNe II have a younger
stellar population than hosts of SNe Ia. These results are compared with those
of the 689 comparison galaxies where the SDSS fiber captures less than 15% of
the total light. These comparison galaxies appear biased towards higher
12+log(O/H) ($\sim$0.1dex) at a given stellar mass. Therefore, we believe the
aperture effect should be kept in mind when the properties of the hosts for
different types of SNe are discussed.
