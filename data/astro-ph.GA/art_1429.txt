The role of turbulence in the warm ionized medium
We discuss the role of turbulence in establishing the observed emission
measures and ionization of the warm ionized medium. A Monte Carlo radiative
transfer code applied to a snapshot of a simulation of a supernova-driven,
multi-temperature, stratified ISM reproduces the essential observed features of
the WIM.
