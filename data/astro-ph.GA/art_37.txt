Interplay of CR-driven galactic wind, magnetic field, and galactic
  dynamo in spiral galaxies
From our radio observations of the magnetic field strength and large-scale
pattern of spiral galaxies of different Hubble types and star formation rates
(SFR) we conclude that - though a high SFR in the disk increases the total
magnetic field strength in the disk and the halo - the SFR does not change the
global field configuration nor influence the global scale heights of the radio
emission. The similar scale heights indicate that the total magnetic field
regulates the galactic wind velocities. The galactic wind itself may be
essential for an effective dynamo action.
