The Sparsest Clusters With O Stars
There is much debate on how high-mass star formation varies with environment,
and whether the sparsest star-forming environments are capable of forming
massive stars. To address this issue, we have observed eight apparently
isolated OB stars in the SMC using HST's Advanced Camera for Surveys. Five of
these objects appear as isolated stars, two of which are confirmed to be
runaways. The remaining three objects are found to exist in sparse clusters,
with <10 companion stars revealed, having masses of 1-4 solar mass. Stochastic
effects dominate in these sparse clusters, so we perform Monte Carlo
simulations to explore how our observations fit within the framework of
empirical, galactic cluster properties. We generate clusters using a simplistic
-2 power-law distribution for either the number of stars per cluster (N_*) or
cluster mass (M_cl). These clusters are then populated with stars randomly
chosen from a Kroupa IMF. We find that simulations with cluster lower-mass
limits of M_cl,lo >20 solar mass and N_*,lo >40 match best with observations of
SMC and Galactic OB star populations. We examine the mass ratio of the
second-most massive and most massive stars (m_max,2/m_max), finding that our
observations all exist below the 20th percentile of our simulated clusters.
However, all of our observed clusters lie within the parameter space spanned by
the simulated clusters, although some are in the lowest 5th percentile
frequency. These results suggest that clusters are built stochastically by
randomly sampling stars from a universal IMF with a fixed stellar upper-mass
limit. In particular, we see no evidence to suggest a m_max - M_cl relation.
Our results may be more consistent with core accretion models of star formation
than with competitive accretion models, and they are inconsistent with the
proposed steepening of the integrated galaxy IMF (IGIMF).
