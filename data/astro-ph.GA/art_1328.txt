The G305 star forming complex: Wide-Area molecular mapping of NH3 and
  H2O masers
We present wide area radio (12 mm) Mopra Telescope observations of the
complex and rich massive star forming region G305. Our goals are to determine
the reservoir for star formation within G305 using NH3 to trace the dense
molecular content, and thus, the gas available to form stars; estimate physical
parameters of detected NH3 clumps (temperature, column density, mass etc);
locate current areas of active star formation via the presence of H2O and
methanol masers and the distribution of YSOs and ultra compact HII regions
associated with this region. This paper details the NH3 (J,K), (1,1), (2,2) and
(3,3) inversion transition and 22 GHz H2O maser observations. We observed a
\sim 1.5\circ x 1\circ region with \sim 2' angular resolution and a sensitivity
of \sim 60 mK per 0.4 km s^-1 channel. We identify 15 NH3 (1,1), 12 NH3 (2,2)
and 6 NH3 (3,3) clumps surrounding the central HII region. The sizes of the
clumps vary between < 2.6 and 10.1 pc, the average kinetic temperature of the
gas is 25 K. We calculate clump masses of > 10^4 M\odot and find the total
molecular mass of the complex to be \sim 6x10^5 M\odot. We note the positions
of 56 star formation tracers, and discover a high degree of correlation with
detected NH3 clumps. We have detected 16 H2O masers, find they correlate with
the detected ammonia clumps and in general are found closer to the NH3 clump
cores than star formation tracers of later evolutionary stages.
