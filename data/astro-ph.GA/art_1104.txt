Stellar Population of the Irregular Galaxy IC 10
Based on our observations with the 6-m BTA telescope at the Special
Astrophysical Observatory, the Russian Academy of Sciences, and archival Hubble
Space Telescope images, we have performed stellar photometry for several
regions of the irregular galaxy IC 10, a member of the Local Group. Distance
moduli with a median value of (m-M)=24.47, D=780+/-40 kpc, have been obtained
by the TRGB method for several regions of IC 10. We have revealed 57 star
clusters with various masses and ages within the fields used. Comparison of the
Hertzsprung - Russell diagrams for star clusters in IC 10 with theoretical
isochrones has shown that this galaxy has an enhanced metallicity, which
probably explains the high ratio of the numbers of carbon and nitrogen
Wolf-Rayet stars (WC/WN). The size of the galaxy's thick disk along its minor
axis is 10'.5 and a more extended halo is observed outside this disk.
