Inverting the White Dwarf Luminosity Function: the Star Formation
  History of the Solar Neighbourhood
I present an algorithm for inverting the luminosity function for white dwarfs
to obtain a maximum likelihood estimate of the star formation rate of the host
stellar population. The algorithm is of the general class of Expectation
Maximization, and involves iteratively improving an initial guess of the star
formation rate. Tests show that the inversion results are quite sensitive to
the assumed metallicity and initial mass function, but relatively insensitive
to the initial-final mass relation and ratio of H/He atmosphere white dwarfs.
Application to two independent determinations of the Solar neighbourhood white
dwarf luminosity function gives similar results: the star formation rate is
characterised by an early burst, and more recent peak at 2-3 Gyr in the past.
