Astrophysical parameters of 14 open clusters projected close to the
  Galactic plane
Astrophysical parameters (\textit{age, reddening, distance, core and cluster
radii}) of 14 open clusters (OCs) projected close to the Galactic plane are
derived with 2MASS photometry. The OCs are Be 63, Be 84, Cz 6, Cz 7, Cz 12, Ru
141, Ru 144, Ru 172, FSR 101, FSR 1430, FSR 1471, FSR 162, FSR 178 and FSR 198.
The OCs Be 63, Be 84, Ru 141, Ru 144, and Ru 172 are studied in more detail
than in previous works, while the others have astrophysical parameters derived
for the first time. The open clusters of the sample are located at
$d_\odot=1.6-7.1$ kpc from the Sun and at Galactocentric distances $5.5-11.8$
kpc, with age in the range 10 Myr to 1.5 Gyr and reddening $E(B-V)$ in the
range $0.19-2.56$ mag. The core and cluster radii are in the range $0.27-1.88$
pc and $2.2-11.27$ pc, respectively. Cz 6 and FSR 198 are the youngest OCs of
this sample, with a population of pre-main sequence (PMS) stars, while FSR 178
is the oldest cluster.
