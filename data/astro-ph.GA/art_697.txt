Scattered Nebular Light in the Extended Orion Nebula
We have combined 327.5 MHz radio observations and optical spectroscopy to
study conditions in the Extended Orion Nebula. We see a steady progression of
characteristics with increasing distance from the dominant photoionizing star
Theta1OriC. This progression includes a decrease in the F(Halpha)/F(Hbeta)
ratio, an increase in the relative strength of scattered stellar continuum,
decrease in electron density determined from the [S II] doublet, and increase
in the ratio of Emission Measures derived from the Hbeta line and the 327.5 MHz
radio continuum. We conclude that beyond about 5' south of Theta1OriC that
scattered light from the much brighter central Huygens region of the nebula
significantly contaminates local emission. This strengthens earlier arguments
that wavelength and model dependent scattering of emission line radiation
imposes a fundamental limit on our ability to determine the physical conditions
and abundances in this and arguably other similar Galactic Nebulae. The
implications for the study of extra-galactic HII regions are even more severe.
We confirm the result of an earlier study that at least the eastern boundary of
the Extended Orion Nebula is dominated by scattered light from the Huygens
region.
