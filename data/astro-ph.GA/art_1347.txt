Far Ultraviolet Diffuse Emission from the Large Magellanic Cloud
We present the first observations of diffuse radiation in the far ultraviolet
(1000 -- 1150 \AA) from the Large Magellanic Cloud based on observations made
with the {\it Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer}. The fraction of the
total radiation in the field emitted as diffuse radiation is typically 5 --
20\% with a high of 45\% near N70 where there are few exciting stars,
indicating that much of the emission is not due to nearby stars. Much less
light is scattered in the far ultraviolet than at longer wavelengths with the
stellar radiation going into heating the interstellar dust.
