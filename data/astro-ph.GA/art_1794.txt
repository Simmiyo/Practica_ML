1.3 mm Wavelength VLBI of Sagittarius A*: Detection of Time-Variable
  Emission on Event Horizon Scales
Sagittarius A*, the ~4 x 10^6 solar mass black hole candidate at the Galactic
Center, can be studied on Schwarzschild radius scales with (sub)millimeter
wavelength Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). We report on 1.3 mm
wavelength observations of Sgr A* using a VLBI array consisting of the JCMT on
Mauna Kea, the ARO/SMT on Mt. Graham in Arizona, and two telescopes of the
CARMA array at Cedar Flat in California. Both Sgr A* and the quasar calibrator
1924-292 were observed over three consecutive nights, and both sources were
clearly detected on all baselines. For the first time, we are able to extract
1.3 mm VLBI interferometer phase information on Sgr A* through measurement of
closure phase on the triangle of baselines. On the third night of observing,
the correlated flux density of Sgr A* on all VLBI baselines increased relative
to the first two nights, providing strong evidence for time-variable change on
scales of a few Schwarzschild radii. These results suggest that future VLBI
observations with greater sensitivity and additional baselines will play a
valuable role in determining the structure of emission near the event horizon
of Sgr A*.
