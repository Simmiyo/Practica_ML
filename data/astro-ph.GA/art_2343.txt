The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in weakly ionised plasmas: Ambipolar
  dominated and Hall dominated flows
The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is well known to be capable of converting
well-ordered flows into more disordered, even turbulent, flows. As such it
could represent a path by which the energy in, for example, bowshocks from
stellar jets could be converted into turbulent energy thereby driving molecular
cloud turbulence. We present the results of a suite of fully multifluid
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of this instability using the HYDRA code. We
investigate the behaviour of the instability in a Hall dominated and an
ambipolar diffusion dominated plasma as might be expected in certain regions of
accretion disks and molecular clouds respectively.
  We find that, while the linear growth rates of the instability are unaffected
by multifluid effects, the non-linear behaviour is remarkably different with
ambipolar diffusion removing large quantities of magnetic energy while the Hall
effect, if strong enough, introduces a dynamo effect which leads to continuing
strong growth of the magnetic field well into the non-linear regime and a lack
of true saturation of the instability.
