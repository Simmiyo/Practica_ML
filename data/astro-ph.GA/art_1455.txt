Water abundances in high-mass protostellar envelopes: Herschel
  observations with HIFI
We derive the dense core structure and the water abundance in four massive
star-forming regions which may help understand the earliest stages of massive
star formation. We present Herschel-HIFI observations of the para-H2O 1_11-0_00
and 2_02-1_11 and the para-H2-18O 1_11-0_00 transitions. The envelope
contribution to the line profiles is separated from contributions by outflows
and foreground clouds. The envelope contribution is modelled using Monte-Carlo
radiative transfer codes for dust and molecular lines (MC3D and RATRAN), with
the water abundance and the turbulent velocity width as free parameters. While
the outflows are mostly seen in emission in high-J lines, envelopes are seen in
absorption in ground-state lines, which are almost saturated. The derived water
abundances range from 5E-10 to 4E-8 in the outer envelopes. We detect cold
clouds surrounding the protostar envelope, thanks to the very high quality of
the Herschel-HIFI data and the unique ability of water to probe them. Several
foreground clouds are also detected along the line of sight. The low H2O
abundances in massive dense cores are in accordance with the expectation that
high densities and low temperatures lead to freeze-out of water on dust grains.
The spread in abundance values is not clearly linked to physical properties of
the sources.
