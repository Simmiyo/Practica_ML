AKARI near-infrared spectroscopy of the aromatic and aliphatic
  hydrocarbon emission features in the galactic superwind of M 82
Aims. We investigate the properties of hydrocarbon grains in the galactic
superwind of M 82. Methods. With AKARI, we performed near-infrared (2.5 - 4.5
um) spectroscopic observations of 34 regions in M 82 including its northern and
southern halos. Results. Many of the spectra show strong emission at 3.3 um due
to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and relatively weak features at 3.4
- 3.6 um due to aliphatic hydrocarbons. In particular, we clearly detect the
PAH 3.3 um emission and the 3.4 - 3.6 um features in halo regions, which are
located at a distance of 2 kpc away from the galactic center. We find that the
ratios of the 3.4 - 3.6 um features to the 3.3 um feature intensity
significantly increase with distance from the galactic center, while the ratios
of the 3.3 um feature to the AKARI 7 um band intensity do not. Conclusions. Our
results clearly confirm the presence of small PAHs even in a harsh environment
of the halo of M 82. The results also reveal that the aliphatic hydrocarbons
emitting the 3.4 - 3.6 um features are unusually abundant in the halo,
suggesting that small carbonaceous grains are produced by shattering of larger
grains in the galactic superwind.
