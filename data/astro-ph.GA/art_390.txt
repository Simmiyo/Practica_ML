Galactic kinematics with modified Newtonian dynamics
We look for observational signatures that could discriminate between
Newtonian and modified Newtonian (MOND) dynamics in the Milky Way, in view of
the advent of large astrometric and spectroscopic surveys. Indeed, a typical
signature of MOND is an apparent disk of "phantom" dark matter, which is
uniquely correlated with the visible disk-density distribution. Due to this
phantom dark disk, Newtonian models with a spherical halo have different
signatures from MOND models close to the Galactic plane. The models can thus be
differentiated by measuring dynamically (within Newtonian dynamics) the disk
surface density at the solar radius, the radial mass gradient within the disk,
or the velocity ellipsoid tilt angle above the Galactic plane. Using the most
realistic possible baryonic mass model for the Milky Way, we predict that, if
MOND applies, the local surface density measured by a Newtonist will be
approximately 78 Msun/pc2 within 1.1 kpc of the Galactic plane, the dynamically
measured disk scale-length will be enhanced by a factor of 1.25 with respect to
the visible disk scale-length, and the local vertical tilt of the velocity
ellipsoid at 1 kpc above the plane will be approximately 6 degrees. None of
these tests can be conclusive for the present-day accuracy of Milky Way data,
but they will be of prime interest with the advent of large surveys such as
GAIA.
