The enormous outer Galaxy HII region CTB 102
We present new radio recombination line observations of the previously
unstudied HII region CTB 102. Line parameters are extracted and physical
parameters describing the gas are calculated. We estimate the distance to CTB
102 to be 4.3 kpc. Through comparisons with HI and 1.42 GHz radio continuum
data, we estimate the size of CTB 102 to be 100-130 pc, making it one of the
largest HII regions known, comparable to the W4 complex. A stellar wind blown
bubble model is presented as the best explanation for the observed morphology,
size and velocities.
