VLBI search for the radio counterpart of HESS J1943+213
HESS J1943+213, a TeV point source close to the Galactic plane recently
discovered by the H.E.S.S. collaboration, was proposed to be an extreme BL
Lacertae object, though a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) nature could not be
completely discarded. To investigate its nature, we performed high-resolution
radio observations with the European Very Long Baseline Interferometry Network
(EVN) and reanalyzed archival continuum and H {\sc i} data. The EVN
observations revealed a compact radio counterpart of the TeV source. The low
brightness temperature and the resolved nature of the radio source are
indications against the beamed BL Lacertae hypothesis. The radio/X-ray source
appears immersed in a $\sim$ 1\arcmin elliptical feature suggesting a possible
galactic origin (PWN nature) for the HESS source. We found that HESS\,J1943+213
is located in the interior of a $\sim1\degr$ diameter H {\sc i} feature, and
explored the possibility of they being physically related.
