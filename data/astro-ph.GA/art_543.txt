Evidence for dust evolution within the Taurus Complex from Spitzer
  images
We present Spitzer images of the Taurus Complex (TC) and take advantage of
the sensitivity and spatial resolution of the observations to characterize the
diffuse IR emission across the cloud. This work highlights evidence of dust
evolution within the translucent sections of the archetype reference for
studies of quiescent molecular clouds. We combine Spitzer 160 um and IRAS 100
um observations to produce a dust temperature map and a far-IR dust opacity map
at 5' resolution. The average dust temperature is about 14.5K with a dispersion
of +/-1K across the cloud. The far-IR dust opacity is a factor 2 larger than
the average value for the diffuse ISM. This opacity increase and the
attenuation of the radiation field (RF) both contribute to account for the
lower emission temperature of the large grains. The structure of the TC
significantly changes in the mid-IR images that trace emission from PAHs and
VSGs. We focus our analysis of the mid-IR emission to a range of ecliptic
latitudes where the zodiacal light residuals are small. Within this cloud area,
there are no 8 and 24 um counterparts to the brightest 160 um emission
features. Conversely, the 8 and 24 um images reveal filamentary structure that
is strikingly inconspicuous in the 160 um and extinction maps. The IR colors
vary over sub-parsec distances across this filamentary structure. We compare
the observed colors with model calculations quantifying the impact of the RF
intensity and the abundance of stochastically heated particles on the dust SED.
To match the range of observed colors, we have to invoke variations by a factor
of a few of both the interstellar RF and the abundance of PAHs and VSGs. We
conclude that within this filamentary structure a significant fraction of the
dust mass cycles in and out the small size end of the dust size distribution.
