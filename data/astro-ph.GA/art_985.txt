Main-Sequence and sub-giant stars in the Globular Cluster NGC6397: The
  complex evolution of the lithium abundance
Thanks to the high multiplex and efficiency of Giraffe at the VLT we have
been able for the first time to observe the Li I doublet in the Main Sequence
(MS) stars of a Globular Cluster. At the same time we observed Li in a sample
of Sub-Giant (SG) stars of the same B-V colour. Our final sample is composed of
84 SG stars and 79 MS stars. In spite of the fact that SG and MS span the same
temperature range we find that the equivalent widths of the Li I doublet in SG
stars are systematically larger than those in MS stars, suggesting a higher Li
content among SG stars. This is confirmed by our quantitative analysis. We
derived the effective temperatures, from H$\alpha$ fitting, and NLTE Li
abundances of the stars in our the sample, using 3D and 1D models. We find that
SG stars have a mean Li abundance higher by 0.1dex than MS stars, using both 1D
and 3D models. We also detect a positive slope of Li abundance with effective
temperature. These results provide an unambiguous evidence that the Li
abundance changes with evolutionary status. The physical mechanisms responsible
for this behaviour are not yet clear, and none of the existing models seems to
describe accurately these observations. Based on these conclusions, we believe
that the cosmological lithium problem still remains an open question.
