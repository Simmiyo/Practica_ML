Is Palomar 1 really associated with the Canis Major overdensity?
It has recently been suggested that the peculiar cluster Pal 1 is associated

debate. Our first measurement of the cluster's chemical abundance ratios allows
us to examine this association and to advance further in the clarification of
Pal 1 possible origin.
