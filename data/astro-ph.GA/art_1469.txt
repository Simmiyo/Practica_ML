Diluting the material forming the second generation stars in Globular
  Clusters: the contribution by unevolved stars
In this short communication we consider the possibility that stars less
evolved than the polluters are the source of the dilution needed to explain the
observed composition of second-generation globular cluster (GC) stars and the
Na-O and Mg-Al anticorrelations. If these stars can lose 0.5-1% of their mass
during the relevant epochs, there is enough diluting material to produce the
observed anticorrelations. In this case, the original mass of proto-GCs was
several tens times higher than the current mass of GCs. While not strictly
impossible, this is a stringent hypothesis that needs more support. Should this
scenario be found true, then the link between the primordial (first-generation)
population in GC and the field population would be very strong.
