Nearby Galaxies in More Distant Contexts
We use published reconstructions of the star formation history (SFH) of the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), Small Magellanic Cloud, and NGC 300 from the
analysis of resolved stellar populations to investigate where such galaxies
might land on well-known extragalactic diagnostic plots over the galaxies'
lifetime (assuming that nothing other than their stellar populations change).
For example, we find that the evolution of these galaxies implies a complex
evolution in the Tully-Fisher relation with lookback time and that the observed
scatter is consistent with excursions these galaxies take as their stellar
populations evolve. We find that the growth of stellar mass is weighted to
early times, despite the strongly star-forming current nature of the three
systems. Lastly, we find that these galaxies can take circuitous paths across
the color-magnitude diagram. For example, it is possible, within the
constraints provided by the current determination of its SFH, that the LMC
reached the red sequence at intermediate age prior to ending back up on the
blue cloud at the current time. Unfortunately, this behavior happens at
sufficiently early times that our resolved SFH is crude and insufficiently
constraining to convincingly demonstrate that this was the actual evolutionary
path. The limited sample size precludes any general conclusions, but we present
these as examples how we can bridge the study of resolved populations and the
more distant universe.
