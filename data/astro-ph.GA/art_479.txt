High-speed knots in the hourglass shaped planetary nebula Hubble 12
We present a detailed kinematical analysis of the young compact
hourglass-shaped planetary nebula Hb 12. We performed optical imaging and
longslit spectroscopy of Hb 12 using the Manchester echelle spectrometer with
the 2.1m San Pedro Martir telescope. We reveal, for the first time, the
presence of end caps (or knots) aligned with the bipolar lobes of the planetary
nebula shell in a deep [NII]6584 image of Hb 12. We measured from our
spectroscopy radial velocities of 120 km/s for these knots. We have derived the
inclination angle of the hourglass shaped nebular shell to be 65 degrees to the
line of sight. It has been suggested that Hb 12's central star system is an
eclipsing binary (Hsia et al. 2006) which would imply a binary inclination of
at least 80 degrees. However, if the central binary has been the major shaping
influence on the nebula then both nebula and binary would be expected to share
a common inclination angle. Finally, we report the discovery of high-velocity
knots with Hubble-type velocities, close to the core of Hb 12, observed in
Halpha and oriented in the same direction as the end caps. Very different
velocities and kinematical ages were calculated for the outer and inner knots
showing that they may originate from different outburst events.
