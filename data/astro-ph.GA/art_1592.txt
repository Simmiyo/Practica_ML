The BLAST View of the Star Forming Region in Aquila (ell=45deg,b=0deg)
We have carried out the first general submillimeter analysis of the field
towards GRSMC 45.46+0.05, a massive star forming region in Aquila. The
deconvolved 6 deg^2 (3\degree X 2\degree) maps provided by BLAST in 2005 at
250, 350, and 500 micron were used to perform a preliminary characterization of
the clump population previously investigated in the infrared, radio, and
molecular maps. Interferometric CORNISH data at 4.8 GHz have also been used to
characterize the Ultracompact HII regions (UCHIIRs) within the main clumps. By
means of the BLAST maps we have produced an initial census of the submillimeter
structures that will be observed by Herschel, several of which are known
Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs). Our spectral energy distributions of the main
clumps in the field, located at ~7 kpc, reveal an active population with
temperatures of T~35-40 K and masses of ~10^3 Msun for a dust emissivity index
beta=1.5. The clump evolutionary stages range from evolved sources, with
extended HII regions and prominent IR stellar population, to massive young
stellar objects, prior to the formation of an UCHIIR.The CORNISH data have
revealed the details of the stellar content and structure of the UCHIIRs. In
most cases, the ionizing stars corresponding to the brightest radio detections
are capable of accounting for the clump bolometric luminosity, in most cases
powered by embedded OB stellar clusters.
