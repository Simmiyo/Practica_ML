Polarized Emission of Sagittarius A*
We explore the parameter space of the two temperature pseudo-Newtonian
Keplerian accretion flow model for the millimeter and shorter wavelength
emission from Sagittarius A*. A general relativistic ray-tracing code is used
to treat the radiative transfer of polarized synchrotron emission from the
flow. The synchrotron self-Comptonization and bremsstrahlung emission
components are also included. It is shown that the model can readily account
for the millimeter to sub-millimeter emission characteristics with an accretion
rate of ~6x10^17g.s^-1 and an inclination angle of ~40 deg. However, the
corresponding model predicted near-infrared and X-ray fluxes are more than one
order of magnitude lower than the observed 'quiescent' state values. While the
extended quiescent-state X-ray emission has been attributed to thermal emission
from the large-scale accretion flow, the NIR emission and flares are likely
dominated by emission regions either within the last stable orbit of a
Schwarzschild black hole or associated with outflows. With the viscous
parameter derived from numerical simulations, there is still a degeneracy
between the electron heating rate and the magnetic parameter. A fully general
relativistic treatment with the black hole spin incorporated will resolve these
issues.
