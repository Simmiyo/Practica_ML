The Warped Disk of Centaurus A from a radius of 2 to 6500 pc
We compile position and inclination angles for tilted ring fits to the warped
dusty and gaseous disk spanning radius 1.8 to 6500 pc from recent observations.
For radii exterior to a kpc, tilted ring orientations lie on an arc on a polar
inclination versus position angle plot, suggesting that precession following a
merger can account for the ring morphology. Three kinks in the ring
orientations are seen on the polar plot, the one at radius of about 1.3 kpc we
suspect corresponds to the location where self-gravity in the disk affects the
ring precession rate. Another at a radius of about 600 pc may be associated
with a gap in the gas distribution. A third kink is seen at a radius of 100 pc.
A constant inclination tilted disk precessing about the jet axis may describe
the disk between 100 and 20 pc but not interior to this. A model with disk
orientation matching the molecular circumnuclear disk at 100 pc that decays at
smaller radii to an inner flat disk perpendicular to the jet may account for
disk orientations within 100 pc. Neither model would account for the cusps or
changes in disk orientation at 100 or 600 pc.
