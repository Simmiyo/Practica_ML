Non-similar collapse of singular isothermal spherical molecular cloud
  cores with nonzero initial velocities
Theoretically, stars have been formed from the collapse of cores in the
molecular clouds. Historically, the core had been assumed as an singular
isothermal sphere (SIS), and the collapse had been investigated by a
self-similar manner. This is while the rotation and magnetic field lead to
non-symmetric collapse so that a spheroid shape may be occurred. Here, the
resultant of the centrifugal force and magnetic field gradient is assumed to be
in the normal direction of the rotational axis, and its components are supposed
to be a fraction $\beta$ of the local gravitational force. In this research, a
collapsing SIS core is considered to find the importance of the parameter
$\beta$ for oblateness of the mass shells which are above the head of the
expansion wave. We apply the Adomian decomposition method to solve the system
of nonlinear partial differential equations because the collapse does not occur
in a spherical symmetry with self-similar behavior. In this way, we obtain a
semi-analytical relation for the mass infall rate $\dot{M}$ of the shells at
the envelope. Near the rotational axis, the $\dot{M}$ decreases with increasing
of the non-dimensional radius $\xi$, while a direct relation is observed
between $\dot{M}$ and $\xi$ in the equatorial regions. Also, the values of
$\dot{M}$ in the polar regions are greater than the equatorial values, and this
difference is more often at smaller values of $\xi$. Overall, the results show
that before reaching the head of expansion wave, the visible shape of the
molecular cloud cores can evolve to oblate spheroids. The ratio of major to
minor axes of oblate cores increases with increasing the parameter $\beta$, and
its value can approach to the apparently observed elongated shapes of cores in
the maps of molecular clouds such as Taurus and Perseus.
