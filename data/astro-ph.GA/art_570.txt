An HST/NICMOS view of the prototypical giant HII region NGC604 in M33
We present the first high-spatial resolution near-infrared (NIR) imaging of
NGC 604, obtained with the NICMOS camera aboard the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST). These NICMOS broadband images reveal new NIR point sources, clusters,
and diffuse structures. We found an excellent spatial correlation between the
8.4 GHz radio continuum and the 2.2mu-m nebular emission. Moreover, massive
young stellar object candidates appear aligned with these radio peaks,
reinforcing the idea that those areas are star-forming regions. Three different
scaled OB associations are recognized in the NICMOS images. The brightest NIR
sources in our images have properties that suggest that they are red supergiant
stars, of which one of them was previously known. This preliminary analysis of
the NICMOS images shows the complexity of the stellar content of the NGC 604
nebula.
