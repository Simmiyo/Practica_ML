Kinematics at the Edge of the Galactic Bulge: Evidence for Cylindrical
  Rotation
We present new results from BRAVA, a large scale radial velocity survey of
the Galactic bulge, using M giant stars selected from the Two Micron All Sky
Survey catalogue as targets for the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory 4m
Hydra multi-object spectrograph. The purpose of this survey is to construct a
new generation of self-consistent bar models that conform to these
observations. We report the dynamics for fields at the edge of the Galactic
bulge at latitudes b=-8 deg. and compare to the dynamics at b=-4 deg. We find
that the rotation curve V(r) is the same at b=-8 deg. as at b=-4 deg. That is,
the Galactic boxy bulge rotates cylindrically, as do boxy bulges of other
galaxies. The summed line of sight velocity distribution at b=-8 deg. is
Gaussian, and the binned longitude-velocity plot shows no evidence for either a
(disk) population with cold dynamics or for a (classical bulge) population with
hot dynamics. The observed kinematics are well modeled by an edge-on N-body
bar, in agreement with published structural evidence. Our kinematic
observations indicate that the Galactic bulge is a prototypical product of
secular evolution in galaxy disks, in contrast with stellar population results
that are most easily understood if major mergers were the dominant formation
process.
