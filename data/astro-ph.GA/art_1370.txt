The Primordial Origin Model of Magnetic Fields in Spiral Galaxies
We propose a primordial-origin model for the composite configurations of
global magnetic fields in spiral galaxies. We show that uniform tilted magnetic
field wound up into a rotating disk galaxy can evolve into composite magnetic
configurations comprising bisymmetric spiral (S=BSS), axisymmetric spiral
(A=ASS), plane-reversed spiral (PR), and/or ring (R) fields in the disk, and
vertical (V) fields in the center. By MHD simulations we show that these
composite galactic fields are indeed created from weak primordial uniform
field, and that the different configurations can co-exist in the same galaxy.
We show that spiral fields trigger the growth of two-armed gaseous arms. The
centrally accumulated vertical fields are twisted and produce jet toward the
halo. We find that the more vertical was the initial uniform field, the
stronger is the formed magnetic field in the galactic disk.
