HyperLEDA. III. The catalogue of extragalactic distances
We present the compilation catalogue of redshift-independent distances
included in the HyperLEDA database. It is actively maintained to be up-to-date,
and the current version counts 6640 distance measurements for 2335 galaxies
compiled from 430 published articles. Each individual series is recalibrated
onto a common distance scale based on a carefully selected set of high-quality
measurements. This information together with data on HI line-width, central
velocity dispersion, magnitudes, diameters, and redshift is used to derive a
homogeneous distance estimate and physical properties of galaxies, such as
their absolute magnitudes and intrinsic size.
