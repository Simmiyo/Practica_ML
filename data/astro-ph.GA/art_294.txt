A high-speed bi-polar outflow from the archetypical pulsating star Mira
  A
Optical images and high-dispersion spectra have been obtained of the ejected
material surrounding the pulsating AGB star Mira A. The two streams of knots on
either side of the star, found in far ultra-viollet (FUV) GALEX images, have
now been imaged clearly in the light of Halpha. Spatially resolved profiles of
the same line reveal that the bulk of these knots form a bi-polar outflow with
radial velocity extremes of +- 150 km/s with respect to the central star. The
South stream is approaching and the North stream receding from the observer. A
displacement away from Mira A between the position of one of the South stream
knots in the new Halpha image and its position in the previous Palomar
Observatory Sky Survey (POSS I) red plate has been noted. If interpreted as a
consequence of expansion proper motions the bipolar outflow is tilted at 69deg
+- 2deg to the plane of the sky, has an outflow velocity of 160 +- 10 km/s and
is ~1000 y old.
