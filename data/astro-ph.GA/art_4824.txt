Beyond the Brim of the Hat: Kinematics of Globular Clusters out to Large
  Radius in the Sombrero Galaxy
We have obtained radial velocity measurements for 51 new globular clusters
around the Sombrero galaxy. These measurements were obtained using
spectroscopic observations from the AAOmega spectrograph on the
Anglo-Australian Telescope and the Hydra spectrograph at WIYN. Combined with
our own past measurements and velocity measurements obtained from the
literature we have constructed a large database of radial velocities that
contains a total of 360 confirmed globular clusters. Previous studies' analyses
of the kinematics and mass profile of the Sombrero globular cluster system have
been constrained to the inner ~9' (~24 kpc or ~5 effective radii), but our new
measurements have increased the radial coverage of the data, allowing us to
determine the kinematic properties of M104 out to ~15' (~41 kpc or ~9 effective
radii). We use our set of radial velocities to study the GC system kinematics
and to determine the mass profile and V-band mass-to-light profile of the
galaxy. We find that the V-band mass-to-light ratio increases from 4.5 at the
center to a value of 20.9 at 41 kpc (~9 effective radii or 15'), which implies
that the dark matter halo extends to the edge of our available data set. We
compare our mass profile at 20 kpc (~4 effective radii or ~7.4') to the mass
computed from x-ray data and find good agreement. We also use our data to look
for rotation in the globular cluster system as a whole, as well as in the red
and blue subpopulations. We find no evidence for significant rotation in any of
these samples.
