Chemical abundances for 11 bulge stars from high-resolution, near-IR
  spectra
It is debated whether the Milky Way bulge has the characteristics of a
classical bulge sooner than those of a pseudobulge. Detailed abundance studies
of bulge stars is a key to investigate the origin, history, and classification
of the bulge. The aim is to add to the discussion on the origin of the bulge
and to study detailed abundances determined from near-IR spectra for bulge
giants already investigated with optical spectra, the latter also providing the
stellar parameters which are very significant for the results of the present
study. Especially, the important CNO elements are better determined in the
near-IR. High-resolution, near-infrared spectra in the H band are recorded
using the CRIRES spectrometer on the Very Large Telescope. The CNO abundances
can all be determined from the numerous molecular lines in the wavelength range
observed. Abundances of the alpha elements are also determined from the near-IR
spectra. [O/Fe], [Si/Fe] and [S/Fe] are enhanced up to metallicities of at
least [Fe/H]=-0.3, after which they decline. This suggests that the Milky Way
bulge experienced a rapid and early star-formation history like that of a
classical bulge. However, a similarity between the bulge trend and the trend of
the local thick disk seems present. Such a similarity could suggest that the
bulge has a pseudobulge origin. Our [C/Fe] trend does not show any increase
with [Fe/H] which could have been expected if W-R stars have contributed
substantially to the C abundances. No "cosmic scatter" can be traced around our
observed abundance trends; the scatter found is expected, given the
observational uncertainties.
