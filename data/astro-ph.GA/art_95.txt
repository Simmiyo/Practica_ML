Galactic outflows and the chemical evolution of dwarf galaxies
Galactic winds in dwarf galaxies are driven by the energy released by
supernova explosions and stellar winds following an intense episode of star
formation, which create an over-pressured cavity of hot gas. Although the
luminosity of the star formation episode and the mass of the galaxy play a key
role in determining the occurrence of the galactic winds and the fate of the
freshly produced metals, other parameters play an equally important role. In
this contribution we address the following questions (i) What is the late
evolution of superbubbles and what is the final fate of the superbubble
cavities? (ii) How does the multi-phase nature of the ISM, in particular the
coexistence of hot gas with embedded clouds, affect the development of galactic
winds? (iii) What is the relation between the flattening of a galaxy and the
development of bipolar galactic winds?
