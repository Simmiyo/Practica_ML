Gas morphology and energetics at the surface of PDRs: new insights with
  Herschel observations of NGC 7023
We investigate the physics and chemistry of the gas and dust in dense
photon-dominated regions (PDRs), along with their dependence on the
illuminating UV field. Using Herschel-HIFI observations, we study the gas
energetics in NGC 7023 in relation to the morphology of this nebula. NGC 7023
is the prototype of a PDR illuminated by a B2V star and is one of the key
targets of Herschel. Our approach consists in determining the energetics of the
region by combining the information carried by the mid-IR spectrum (extinction
by classical grains, emission from very small dust particles) with that of the
main gas coolant lines. In this letter, we discuss more specifically the
intensity and line profile of the 158 micron (1901 GHz) [CII] line measured by
HIFI and provide information on the emitting gas. We show that both the [CII]
emission and the mid-IR emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
arise from the regions located in the transition zone between atomic and
molecular gas. Using the Meudon PDR code and a simple transfer model, we find
good agreement between the calculated and observed [CII] intensities. HIFI
observations of NGC 7023 provide the opportunity to constrain the energetics at
the surface of PDRs. Future work will include analysis of the main coolant line
[OI] and use of a new PDR model that includes PAH-related species.
