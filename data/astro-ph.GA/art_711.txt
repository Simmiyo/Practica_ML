Globular clusters in modified Newtonian dynamics: velocity-dispersion
  profiles from self-consistent models
We test the modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) theory with the
velocity-dispersion profiles of Galactic globular clusters populating the
outermost region of the Milky Way halo, where the Galactic acceleration is
lower than the characteristic MOND acceleration a_0. For this purpose, we
constructed self-consistent, spherical models of stellar systems in MOND, which
are the analogues of the Newtonian King models. The models are spatially
limited, reproduce well the surface-brightness profiles of globular clusters,
and have velocity-dispersion profiles that differ remarkably in shape from the
corresponding Newtonian models. We present dynamical models of six globular
clusters, which can be used to efficiently test MOND with the available
observing facilities. A comparison with recent spectroscopic data obtained for
NGC2419 suggests that the kinematics of this cluster might be hard to explain
in MOND.
