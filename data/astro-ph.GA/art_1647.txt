Chemical abundances in the protoplanetary disk LV2 (Orion): clues to the
  causes of the abundance anomaly in HII regions
Optical integral field spectroscopy of the archetype protoplanetary disk LV2
in the Orion Nebula is presented, taken with the VLT FLAMES/Argus fibre array.
The detection of recombination lines of CII and OII from this class of objects
is reported, and the lines are utilized as abundance diagnostics. The study is
complemented with the analysis of HST Faint Object Spectrograph ultraviolet and
optical spectra of the target contained within the Argus field of view. By
subtracting the local nebula background the intrinsic spectrum of the proplyd
is obtained and its elemental composition is derived for the first time. The
proplyd is found to be overabundant in carbon, oxygen and neon compared to the
Orion Nebula and the sun. The simultaneous coverage over LV2 of the CIII]
1908-A and [OIII] 5007-A collisionally excited lines (CELs) and CII and OII
recombination lines (RLs) has enabled us to measure the abundances of C++ and
O++ for LV2 with both sets of lines. The two methods yield consistent results
for the intrinsic proplyd spectrum, but not for the proplyd spectrum
contaminated by the generic nebula spectrum, thus providing one example where
the long-standing abundance anomaly plaguing metallicity studies of HII regions
has been resolved. These results would indicate that the standard
forbidden-line methods used in the derivation of light metal abundances in HII
regions in our own and other galaxies underestimate the true gas metallicity.
