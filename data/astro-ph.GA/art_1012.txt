Observations and Modelling of Relativistic Spin Precession in PSR
  J1141-6545
Observations of the binary pulsar PSR J1141-6545 using the Parkes radio
telescope over 9.3 years show clear time-variations in pulse width, shape and
polarization. We interpret these variations in terms of relativistic precession
of the pulsar spin axis about the total angular momentum vector of the system.
Over the nine years, the pulse width at the 50% level has changed by more than
a factor of three. Large variations have also been observed in the 1400-MHz
mean flux density. The pulse polarization has been monitored since 2004 April
using digital filterbank systems and also shows large and systematic variations
in both linear and circular polarization. Position angle variations, both
across the pulse profile and over the data span, are complex, with major
differences between the central and outer parts of the pulse profile. Modelling
of the observed position angle variations by relativistic precession of the
pulsar spin axis shows that the spin-orbit misalignment angle is about 110 deg
and that the precessional phase has passed through 180 deg during the course of
our observations. At the start of our observations, the line-of-sight impact
parameter was about 4 deg in magnitude and it reached a minimum very close to 0
deg around early 2007, consistent with the observed pulse width variations. We
have therefore mapped approximately one half of the emission beam, showing that
it is very asymmetric with respect to the magnetic axis. The derived
precessional parameters imply that the pre-supernova star had a mass of about 2
Msun and that the supernova recoil kick velocity was relatively small. With the
reversal in the rate of change of the impact parameter, we predict that over
the next decade we will see a reversed "replay" of the variations observed in
the past decade.
