Maser maps and magnetic field of OH 300.969+1.147
The southern maser site OH 300.969+1.147 has been studied using the Long
Baseline Array of the Australia Telescope National Facility. The 1665- and
1667-MHz hydroxyl ground-state transitions were observed simultaneously. A
series of maps with tenth-arcsec spatial resolution, at velocity spacing 0.09
km/s, and in both senses of circular polarization, reveal 59 small diameter
maser spots. The spots are scattered over 2-arcsec, coincident with a strong
ultracompact HII region, at a distance of 4.3 kpc. 17 Zeeman pairs of
oppositely polarized spots were found, all yielding magnetic field estimates
towards us (negative), ranging from -1.1 to -4.7 mG, with a median value of
-3.5 mG. Excited state masers of OH at 6035 MHz and 6030 MHz at this site also
display Zeeman pairs revealing a magnetic field of -5.0 mG. Weak methanol maser
emission is intermingled with the OH masers, but there is no detectable closely
related water maser. The consistent magnetic field direction found within this
site is a striking feature of several other maser sites associated with strong
HII regions studied in comparable detail. We interpret the site as a mature
region nearing the end of the brief evolutionary stage that can support maser
emission.
