Tracing early evolutionary stages of high-mass star formation with
  molecular lines
Despite its major role in the evolution of the interstellar medium, the
formation of high-mass stars (M > 10 Msol) is still poorly understood. Two
types of massive star cluster precursors, the so-called Massive Dense Cores
(MDCs), have been observed, which differ in their mid-infrared brightness. The
origin of this difference is not established and could be the result of
evolution, density, geometry differences, or a combination of these. We compare
several molecular tracers of physical conditions (hot cores, shocks) observed
in a sample of mid-IR weak emitting MDCs with previous results obtained in a
sample of exclusively mid-IR bright MDCs. The aim is to understand the
differences between these two types of object. We present single-dish
observations of HDO, H2O-18, SO2 and CH3OH lines at lambda = 1.3 - 3.5 mm. We
study line profiles and estimate abundances of these molecules, and use a
partial correlation method to search for trends in the results. The detection
rates of thermal emission lines are found to be very similar between mid-IR
quiet and bright objects. The abundances of H2O, HDO (1E-13 to 1E-9 in the cold
outer envelopes), SO2 and CH3OH differ from source to source but independently
of their mid-IR flux. In contrast, the methanol class I maser emission, a
tracer of outflow shocks, is found to be strongly anti-correlated with the 12
micron source brightnesses. The enhancement of the methanol maser emission in
mid-IR quiet MDCs may indicate a more embedded nature. Since total masses are
similar between the two samples, we suggest that the matter distribution is
spherical around mid-IR quiet sources but flattened around mid-IR bright ones.
In contrast, water emission is associated with objects containing a hot
molecular core, irrespective of their mid-IR brightness. These results indicate
that the mid-IR brightness of MDCs is an indicator of their evolutionary stage.
