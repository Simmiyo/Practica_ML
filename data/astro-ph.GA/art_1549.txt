The ability of intermediate-band Stromgren photometry to correctly
  identify dwarf, subgiant, and giant stars and provide stellar metallicities
  and surface gravities
[Abridged] Several large scale photometric and spectroscopic surveys are
being undertaken to provide a more detailed picture of the Milky Way. Given the
necessity of generalisation in the determination of, e.g., stellar parameters
when tens and hundred of thousands of stars are considered it remains important
to provide independent, detailed studies to verify the methods used in the
surveys. We evaluate available calibrations for deriving [M/H] from Stromgren
photometry and develop the standard sequences for dwarf stars to reflect their
metallicity dependence and test how well metallicities derived from ugriz
photometry reproduce metallicities derived from the well-tested system of
Stromgren photometry. We use a catalogue of dwarf stars with both Stromgren
uvby photometry and spectroscopically determined iron abundances (in total 451
dwarf stars with 0.3<(b-y)_0<1.0). We also evaluate available calibrations that
determine log g. A larger catalogue, in which metallicity is determined
directly from uvby photometry, is used to trace metallicity-dependent standard
sequences for dwarf stars. We derive new standard sequences in the c_1,0 versus
(b-y)_0 plane and in the c_1,0 versus (v-y)_0 plane for dwarf stars with 0.40 <
(b-y)_0 < 0.95 and 1.10 < (v-y)_0 < 2.38. We recommend the calibrations by
Ramirez & Me'endez (2005) for deriving metallicities from Stromgren photometry
and find that intermediate band photometry, such as Stromgren photometry, more
accurately than broad band photometry reproduces spectroscopically determined
[Fe/H]. Stromgren photometry is also better at differentiating between dwarf
and giant stars. We conclude that additional investigations of the differences
between metallicities derived from ugriz photometry and intermediate-band
photometry, such as Stromgren photometry, are required.
