Faint emission lines in planetary nebulae with a [WC] nucleus
We present first results from the analysis of a sample of 14 planetary
nebulae with [WC] nucleus with detected faint carbon and oxygen recombination
lines (RLs). The results are based on deep echelle spectra obtained with MIKE
on the 6.5 m Magellan-Clay telescope in Chile.
