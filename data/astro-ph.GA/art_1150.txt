Looking into the hearts of Bok globules: MM and submm continuum images
  of isolated star-forming cores
We present the results of a comprehensive infrared, submillimetre, and
millimetre continuum emission study of isolated low-mass star-forming cores in
32 Bok globules, with the aim to investigate the process of star formation in
these regions. The submillimetre and millimetre dust continuum emission maps
together with the spectral energy distributions are used to model and derive
the physical properties of the star-forming cores, such as luminosities, sizes,
masses, densities, etc. Comparisons with ground-based near-infrared and
space-based mid and far-infrared images from Spitzer are used to reveal the
stellar content of the Bok globules, association of embedded young stellar
objects with the submm dust cores, and the evolutionary stages of the
individual sources. Submm dust continuum emission was detected in 26 out of the
32 globule cores observed. For 18 globules with detected (sub)mm cores we
derive evolutionary stages and physical parameters of the embedded sources. We
identify nine starless cores, most of which are presumably prestellar, nine
Class 0 protostars, and twelve Class I YSOs. Specific source properties like
bolometric temperature, core size, and central densities are discussed as
function of evolutionary stage. We find that at least two thirds (16 out of 24)
of the star-forming globules studied here show evidence of forming multiple
stars on scales between 1,000 and 50,000 AU. However, we also find that most of
these small prototstar and star groups are comprised of sources with different
evolutionary stages, suggesting a picture of slow and sequential star formation
in isolated globules
