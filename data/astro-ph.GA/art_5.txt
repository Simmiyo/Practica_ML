A Limit on the Polarized Anomalous Microwave Emission of Lynds 1622
The dark cloud Lynds 1622 is one of a few specific sites in the Galaxy where,
relative to observed free-free and vibrational dust emission, there is a clear
excess of microwave emission. In order to constrain models for this microwave
emission, and to better establish the contribution which it might make to
ongoing and near-future microwave background polarization experiments, we have
used the Green Bank Telescope to search for linear polarization at 9.65 Ghz
towards Lynds 1622. We place a 95.4% upper limit of 88 micro-Kelvin (123
micro-Kelvin at 99.7 confidence) on the total linear polarization of this
source averaged over a 1'.3 FWHM beam. Relative to the observed level of
anomalous emission in Stokes I these limits correspond to fractional linear
polarizations of 2.7% and 3.5%.
