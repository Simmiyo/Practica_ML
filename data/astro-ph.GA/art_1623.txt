The Balloon-Borne Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (BLAST) 2005: A
  10 deg^2 Survey of Star Formation in Cygnus X
We present Cygnus X in a new multi-wavelength perspective based on an
unbiased BLAST survey at 250, 350, and 500 micron, combined with rich datasets
for this well-studied region. Our primary goal is to investigate the early
stages of high mass star formation. We have detected 184 compact sources in
various stages of evolution across all three BLAST bands. From their
well-constrained spectral energy distributions, we obtain the physical
properties mass, surface density, bolometric luminosity, and dust temperature.
Some of the bright sources reaching 40 K contain well-known compact H II
regions. We relate these to other sources at earlier stages of evolution via
the energetics as deduced from their position in the luminosity-mass (L-M)
diagram. The BLAST spectral coverage, near the peak of the spectral energy
distribution of the dust, reveals fainter sources too cool (~ 10 K) to be seen
by earlier shorter-wavelength surveys like IRAS. We detect thermal emission
from infrared dark clouds and investigate the phenomenon of cold ``starless
cores" more generally. Spitzer images of these cold sources often show stellar
nurseries, but these potential sites for massive star formation are ``starless"
in the sense that to date there is no massive protostar in a vigorous accretion
phase. We discuss evolution in the context of the L-M diagram. Theory raises
some interesting possibilities: some cold massive compact sources might never
form a cluster containing massive stars; and clusters with massive stars might
not have an identifiable compact cold massive precursor.
