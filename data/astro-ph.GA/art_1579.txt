Calibration of radii and masses of open clusters with a simulation
Context: A recent new approach to apply a simple dynamical mass estimate of
tidally limited star clusters is based on the identification of the tidal
radius in a King profile with the dynamical Jacobi radius. The application to
an unbiased open cluster catalogue yields significantly higher cluster masses
compared to the classical methods. Aims: We quantify the bias in the mass
determination as function of projection direction and cluster age by analysing
a simulated star cluster. Methods: We use direct $N$-body simulations of a star
cluster including stellar evolution in an analytic Milky Way potential and
apply a best fit to the projected number density of cluster stars. Results: We
obtain significantly overestimated star cluster masses which depend strongly on
the viewing direction. The overestimation is typically in the range of 10-50
percent and reaches a factor of 3.5 for young clusters. Mass segregation
reduces the derived limiting radii systematically.
