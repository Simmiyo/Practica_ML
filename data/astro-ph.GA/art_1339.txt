NGC 765 - A disturbed H I giant
We present Hi spectral line and radio-continuum VLA data of the galaxy NGC
765, complemented by optical and Chandra X-ray maps. NGC 765 has the largest
Hi-to-optical ratio known to date of any spiral galaxy and one of the largest
known Hi discs in absolute size with a diameter of 240 kpc measured at a
surface density of 2e19 atoms/cm^2. We derive a total Hi mass of M_HI = 4.7e10
Msun, a dynamical mass of Mdyn - 5.1e11 Msun and an Hi mass to luminosity ratio
of M_HI/L_B = 1.6, making it the nearest and largest "crouching giant". Optical
images reveal evidence of a central bar with tightly wound low-surface
brightness spiral arms extending from it. Radio-continuum (L_1.4 GHz = 1.3e21
W/Hz) and X-ray (L_X ~ 1.7e40 erg/s) emission is found to coincide with the
optical core of the galaxy, compatible with nuclear activity powered by a
low-luminosity AGN. We may be dealing with a galaxy that has retained in its
current morphology traces of its formation history. In fact, it may still be
undergoing some accretion, as evidenced by the presence of Hi clumps the size <
10 kpc and mass (10e8-10e9 Msun) of small (dIrr) galaxies in the outskirts of
its Hi disc and by the presence of two similarly sized companions.
