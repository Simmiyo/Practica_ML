Disruption of Dwarf Satellite Galaxies without Dark Matter
The evolution of a satellite galaxy of a Milky Way like galaxy has been
studied using N-Body simulations. The initial satellites, containing one
million particles, have been simulated by a Plummer sphere, while the potential
of the host galaxy is a three component rigid potential: disc, bulge and dark
matter halo. It has been found that several orbits of the satellites allow for
the existence, for about 1 Gyr or more, of an out-of-equilibrium body that
could be interpreted as a dSph satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. In addition,
from the study of the evolution of the mass-to-light ratios of satellites that
show a disrupted phase it has been found that it is possible that some dSph
galaxies of the Milky Way with large M/L ratios might not be dark matter
dominated and that their high mass to light ratios are observed because they
are out of equilibrium objects.
