Review of results from EROS Microlensing search for Massive Compact
  Objects
We present the results of the EROS2 search for the hidden galactic matter of
the halo through the gravitational microlensing of stars in the Magellanic
clouds. Microlensing was also searched for and found in the Milky-Way plane,
where foreground faint stars are expected to lens background stars. A total of
67 million of stars were monitored over a period of about 7 years. Hundreds of
microlensing candidates have been found in the galactic plane, but only one was
found towards the subsample of bright --well measured-- Magellanic stars. This
result implies that massive compact halo objects (machos) in the mass range
$10^{-7}M_\odot<M<5M_{\odot}$ are ruled out as a major component of the Milky
Way Halo.
