Synchrotron Constraints on a Hybrid Cosmic-Ray and Thermally-Driven
  Galactic Wind
Cosmic rays and magnetic fields can substantially impact the launching of
large-scale galactic winds. Many researchers have investigated the role of
cosmic rays; our group previously showed that a cosmic-ray and thermally-driven
wind could explain soft X-ray emission towards the center of the Galaxy. In
this paper, we calculate the synchrotron emission from our original wind model
and compare it to observations; the synchrotron data shows that earlier
assumptions about the launching conditions of the wind must be changed: we are
required to improve that earlier model by restricting the launching region to
the domain of the inner "Molecular Ring", and by decreasing the magnetic field
strength from the previously assumed maximum strength. With these
physically-motived modifications, we find that a wind model can fit both the
radio synchrotron and the X-ray emission, although that model is required to
have a higher gas pressure and density than the previous model in order to
reproduce the observed X-ray emission measure within the smaller `footprint'.
The drop in magnetic field also decreases the effect of cosmic-ray heating,
requiring a higher temperature at the base of the wind than the previous model.
