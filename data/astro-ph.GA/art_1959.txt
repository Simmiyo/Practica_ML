Infrared photometric study of the massive star forming region S235 using
  Spitzer-IRAC and JHK observations
We present the {\it Spitzer}-IRAC images of the S235 star forming complex
that includes the East~1 & 2, Central and S235 A & B regions. In addition, we
present the near-infrared images of the S235 A & B regions. The IRAC photometry
reveals on-going star formation, with 86 Class 0/I and 144 Class II YSOs in the
entire S235 complex. Nearly 73% of these YSOs are present in clusters with a
maximum surface density of 120 YSOs/pc$^{2}$ (in the vicinity of S235A & B
regions). A few YSOs, possibly in an arc-like formation, are identified towards
the south of S235A region, which may be speculated as an evidence for
magnetically super-critical collapse. One of the sources in the arc-like
formation, namely S235AB-MIR, seems to be a young, massive star that is still
accreting matter. SED modeling of some of the newly identified YSOs confirms
the classification made on the basis of IRAC colours. The IRAC ratio map of
Ch2/Ch4 traces clearly the Br$\alpha$ emission associated with the HII region
of S235A within the horse-shoe envelope. Outside the horse-shoe structure, the
ratio map indicates shock-excited H$_{2}$ emission. Br$\alpha$ emission is also
seen around S235B (from the ratio map). The ratio map of Ch2/Ch4 reveals that
the source "e2s3" in the East~2 region may be associated with shock-excited
H$_2$ emission outflow or jet. The SED modeling of this new source indicates
that it is a very young massive star that is not yet able to drive an HII
region.
