Six more quasars at redshift 6 discovered by the Canada-France High-z
  Quasar Survey
We present imaging and spectroscopic observations for six quasars at z>5.9
discovered by the Canada-France High-z Quasar Survey (CFHQS). The CFHQS
contains sub-surveys with a range of flux and area combinations to sample a
wide range of quasar luminosities at z~6. The new quasars have luminosities 10
to 75 times lower than the most luminous SDSS quasars at this redshift. The
least luminous quasar, CFHQS J0216-0455 at z=6.01, has absolute magnitude
M_1450=-22.21, well below the likely break in the luminosity function. This
quasar is not detected in a deep XMM-Newton survey showing that optical
selection is still a very efficient tool for finding high redshift quasars.
