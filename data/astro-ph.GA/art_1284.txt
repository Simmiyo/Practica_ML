A Sample of Intermediate-Mass Star-Forming Regions: Making Stars at Mass
  Column Densities <1 g/cm^2
In an effort to understand the factors that govern the transition from low-
to high-mass star formation, we identify for the first time a sample of
intermediate-mass star-forming regions (IM SFRs) where stars up to - but not
exceeding - 8 solar masses are being produced. We use IRAS colors and Spitzer
Space Telescope mid-IR images, in conjunction with millimeter continuum and CO
maps, to compile a sample of 50 IM SFRs in the inner Galaxy. These are likely
to be precursors to Herbig AeBe stars and their associated clusters of low-mass
stars. IM SFRs constitute embedded clusters at an early evolutionary stage akin
to compact HII regions, but they lack the massive ionizing central star(s). The
photodissociation regions that demarcate IM SFRs have typical diameters of ~1
pc and luminosities of ~10^4 solar luminosities, making them an order of
magnitude less luminous than (ultra)compact HII regions. IM SFRs coincide with
molecular clumps of mass ~10^3 solar masses which, in turn, lie within larger
molecular clouds spanning the lower end of the giant molecular cloud mass
range, 10^4-10^5 solar masses. The IR luminosity and associated molecular mass
of IM SFRs are correlated, consistent with the known luminosity-mass
relationship of compact HII regions. Peak mass column densities within IM SFRs
are ~0.1-0.5 g/cm^2, a factor of several lower than ultra-compact HII regions,
supporting the proposition that there is a threshold for massive star formation
at ~1 g/cm^2.
