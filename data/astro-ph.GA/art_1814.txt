Fundamental Parameters of Some New Discovered Open star Clusters
We present here the fundamental properties of some newly discovered open star
clusters (Teutsch 144, Alessi 53, Riddle 4 and Juchrt 12) using the JHK Near-IR
photometry (2MASS survey) of Cutri et al. (2003). These clusters have been
selected from Kronberger et al. (2006) who presented some new discovered
stellar groups on the basis of 2MASS photometry and the DSS visual images. The
astrometry and photometric parameters are determined using the stellar density
distributions and color-magnitude diagrams fittings. Center, radius,
membership, distances, reddening, age, luminosity function, mass function,
total mass, and the dynamical relaxation time have been estimated for the first
time. This paper is a part of Reda's PhD project.
