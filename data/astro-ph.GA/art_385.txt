The stellar population of the star forming region G61.48+0.09
- Context: We present the results of a near-infrared photometric and
spectroscopic study of the star forming region G61.48+0.09. - Aims: The purpose
of this study is to characterize the stellar content of the cluster and to
determine its distance, extinction, age and mass. - Methods: The stellar
population was studied by using color-magnitude diagrams to select twenty
promising cluster members, for which follow up spectroscopy was done. The
observed spectra allowed a spectral classification of the stars. - Results: Two
stars have emission lines, twelve are G-type stars, and six are late-O or
early-B stars. - Conclusions: The cluster's extinction varies from A_{K_S} =
0.9 to A_{K_S} = 2.6, (or A_{V}~8 to A_{V}~23). G61.48+0.09 is a star forming
region located at 2.5+/-0.4 Kpc. The cluster is younger than 10 Myr and has a
minimum stellar mass of 1500+/-500 Solar masses. However, the actual total mass
of the cluster remains undetermined, as we cannot see its whole stellar
content.
