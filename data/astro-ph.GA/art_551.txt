Implications of Bulk Velocity Structures in AGN Jets
The synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) models and External Compton (EC) models of
AGN jets with continually longitudinal and transverse bulk velocity structures
are constructed. The observed spectra show complex and interesting patterns in
different velocity structures and viewing angles. These models are used to
calculate the synchrotron and inverse Compton spectra of two typical BL Lac
objects (BLO) (Mrk 421 and 0716+714) and one Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars
(FSRQs) (3c 279), and to discuss the implications of jet bulk velocity
structures in unification of the BLO and FR I radio galaxies (FRI). By
calculating the synchrotron spectra and SSC spectra of BL Lac object jets with
continually bulk velocity structures, we find that the spectra are much
different from ones in jets with uniform velocity structure under the increase
of viewing angles. The unification of BLO and FRI is less constrained by
viewing angles and would be imprinted by velocity structures intrinsic to the
jet themselves. By considering the jets with bulk velocity structures
constrained by apparent speed, we discuss the velocity structures imprinted on
the observed spectra for different viewing angles. We find that the spectra are
greatly impacted by longitudinal velocity structures, becasue the volume
elements are compressed or expanded. Finally, we present the EC spectra of
FSRQs and FR II radio galaxies (FRII) and find that they are weakly affected by
velocity structures compared to synchrotron and SSC spectra.
