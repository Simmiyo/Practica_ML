Extinction toward the Compact HII Regions G-0.02-0.07
The four HII regions in the Sgr A East complex: A, B, C, and D, represent
evidence of recent massive star formation in the central ten parsecs. Using
Paschen-alpha images taken with HST and 8.4 GHz VLA data, we construct an
extinction map of A-D, and briefly discuss their morphology and location.
