Topics on Galactic Chemical Evolution
I discuss three different topics in Galactic chemical evolution:the
"puzzling" absence of any observational signature of secondary elements ; the
building of the Galactic halo in the framework of hierarchical galaxy
formation, as evidenced from its metallicity distribution ; and the potentially
important role that radial migration may play in the evolution of galactic
disks, according to recent studies.
