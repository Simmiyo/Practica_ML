30 Years of Star Formation at UKIRT
It's safe to say that UKIRT's contribution to star formation at
near-infrared, mid-infrared, and even sub-millimetre wavelengths has been
considerable. From the early days of single-detector photometers, through the
development of 2-D arrays and complex multi-mode imager-spectrometers, to the
present-day large-format imager WFCAM, UKIRT has offered the international
community access to some of the world's most innovating, competitive, and
versatile instrumentation possible. Suffice to say, UKIRT users have made the
most of these instruments! In this article I try to give a taste of the variety
of star formation research that has come to pass at UKIRT (with apologies to
those whose important work I fail to mention).
