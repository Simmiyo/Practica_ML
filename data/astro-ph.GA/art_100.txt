A study of the kinematics near WR-stars in the IC10 galaxy
A study of the ionized and neutral gas kinematics near 23 WR stars in the Irr
galaxy IC10 are provided. For most of the stars sings of the WR winds impact on
the interstellar medium were detected. A rough estimate of the power of wind WR
stars is about ~(0.01-0.84) 10^38 erg / sec.
