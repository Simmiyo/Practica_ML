Testing stellar cusp formation theories with observations of the Milky
  Way nuclear star cluster
(Abridged) We report on the structure of the nuclear star cluster in the
innermost 0.16 pc of the Galaxy as measured by the number density profile of
late-type giants. Using laser guide star adaptive optics in conjunction with
the integral field spectrograph, OSIRIS, at the Keck II telescope, we are able
to differentiate between the older, late-type (~ 1 Gyr) stars, which are
presumed to be dynamically relaxed, and the unrelaxed young (~ 6 Myr)
population. This distinction is crucial for testing models of stellar cusp
formation in the vicinity of a black hole, as the models assume that the cusp
stars are in dynamical equilibrium in the black hole potential. We find that
contamination from young stars is significant, with more than twice as many
young stars as old stars in our sensitivity range (K < 15.5) within the central
arcsecond. Based on the late-type stars alone, the surface stellar number
density profile, is flat, with a projected power law slope of -0.26+-0.24.
These results are consistent with the nuclear star cluster having no cusp, with
a core profile that is significantly flatter than predicted by most cusp
formation theories. Here, we also review the methods for further constraining
the true three-dimensional radial profile using kinematic measurements. Precise
acceleration measurements in the plane of the sky as well as along the line of
sight has the potential to directly measure the density profile to establish
whether there is a "hole" in the distribution of late-type stars in the inner
0.1 pc.
