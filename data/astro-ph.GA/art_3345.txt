A search for mass segregation of stars and brown dwarfs in ρ\
  Ophiuchi
We apply two different algorithms to search for mass segregation to a recent
observational census of the rho Ophiuchi star forming region. Firstly, we apply
the Lambda_MSR method, which compares the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a
chosen subset of stars to MSTs of random subsets of stars in the cluster, and
determine the mass segregation ratio, Lambda_MSR. Secondly, we apply the
m-Sigma method, which calculates the local stellar surface density around each
star and determines the statistical significance of the average surface density
for a chosen mass bin, compared to the average surface density in the whole
cluster. Using both methods, we find no indication of mass segregation (normal
or inverse) in the spatial distribution of stars and brown dwarfs in rho
Ophiuchi. Although rho Ophiuchi suffers from high visual extinction, we show
that a significant mass segregation signature would be detectable, albeit
slightly diluted, despite dust obscuration of centrally located massive stars.
