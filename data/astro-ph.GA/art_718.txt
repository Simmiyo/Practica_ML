The Mid-Infrared Colours of Galactic Bulge, Disk and Magellanic
  Planetary Nebulae
We present mid-infrared (MIR) photometry for 367 Galactic disk, bulge and
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) planetary nebulae, determined using GLIMPSE II and
SAGE data acquired using the Spitzer Space Telescope. This has permitted us to
make a comparison between the luminosity functions of bulge and LMC planetary
nebulae, and between the MIR colours of all three categories of source. It is
determined that whilst the 3.6 microns luminosity function of the LMC and bulge
sources are likely to be closely similar, the [3.6]-[5.8] and [5.8]-[8-0]
indices of LMC nebulae are different from those of their disk and bulge
counterparts. This may arise because of enhanced 6.2 microns PAH emission
within the LMC sources, and/or as a result of differences between the spectra
of LMC PNe and those of their Galactic counterparts. We also determine that the
more evolved disk sources listed in the MASH catalogues of Parker et al. and
Miszalski et al. (2008) have similar colours to those of the less evolved (and
higher surface brightness) sources in the catalogue of Acker et al. (1992); a
result which appears at variance with previous studies of these sources.
