Multi-messenger model for the starburst galaxy M82
In this paper, a consistent model of the multifrequency emission of the
starburst galaxy M82, from radio to gamma-rays is presented and discussed.
Predictions for observations with Fermi, MAGIC II/VERITAS and CTA telescopes
are made. The model is also used to self-consistenty compute the (all flavors)
emission of neutrinos resulting from this starburst galaxy, what can be used in
considerations of the diffuse contributions of such objects.
