N-body simulations for testing the stability of triaxial galaxies in
  MOND
We perform a stability test of triaxial models in MOdified Newtonian Dynamics
(MOND) using N-body simulations. The triaxial models considered here have
densities that vary with $r^{-1}$ in the center and $r^{-4}$ at large radii.
The total mass of the model varies from $10^8\Msun$ to $10^{10}\Msun$,
representing the mass scale of dwarfs to medium-mass elliptical galaxies,
respectively, from deep MOND to quasi-Newtonian gravity. We build triaxial
galaxy models using the Schwarzschild technique, and evolve the systems for 200
Keplerian dynamical times (at the typical length scale of 1.0 kpc). We find
that the systems are virial overheating, and in quasi-equilibrium with the
relaxation taking approximately 5 Keplerian dynamical times (1.0 kpc). For all
systems, the change of the inertial (kinetic) energy is less than 10% (20%)
after relaxation. However, the central profile of the model is flattened during
the relaxation and the (overall) axis ratios change by roughly 10% within 200
Keplerian dynamical times (at 1.0kpc) in our simulations. We further find that
the systems are stable once they reach the equilibrium state.
