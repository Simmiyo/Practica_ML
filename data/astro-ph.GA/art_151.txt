Detection of the 3.3um PAH feature as well as water ice and HAC
  absorption in z~2 ULIRGs
We present preliminary results from the highest available signal-to-noise
rest-frame 2-8um spectra of z~2 ULIRGs. Our 10 targets are selected for their
deep silicate absorption features based on previous shallower IRS spectra. The
goal of this follow-up program is: 1) allow for a more accurate analysis of
inner/hot dust continuum, 2) detecting the 3.3um and 6.2um PAH features, and 3)
detecting molecular absorption features such as due to water ice and
hydrocarbons (HACs). We find that the 3.4um HAC absorption feature is observed
in four sources, while the 3.05um water ice feature is observed in three of the
sources. The HAC detectability is higher and ice detectability lower than
expected from local ULIRGs, but consistent with a more AGN-dominated sample
such as this one. Where ice is detected, the ice-to-silicate ratio is somewhat
lower than many local ULIRGs implying on average thinner ice mantles. One
source shows the, to our knowledge, highest redshift reported detection of the
3.3um PAH feature (along with a previously detected 6.2um feature). The
strength of the 3.3um feature is as expected for a starburst-dominated ULIRG.
