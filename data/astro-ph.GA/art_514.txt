A study of the Galactic plane towards l = 305
We present optical ($UBVI_C$) observations of a rich and complex field in the
Galactic plane towards $l \sim 305^{\circ}$ and $b \sim 0^{\circ}$. Our
analysis reveals a significantly high interstellar absorbtion ($A_V \sim 10$)
and an abnormal extinction law in this line of sight. Availing a considerable
number of color combinations, the photometric diagrams allow us to derive new
estimates of the fundamental parameters of the two open clusters Danks~1 and
Danks~2. Due to the derived abnormal reddening law in this line of sight, both
clusters appear much closer (to the Sun) than previously thought. %
Additionally, we present the optical colors and magnitudes of the WR~48a star
and its main parameters were estimated. The properties of the two embedded
clusters DBS2003~130 and 131, are also addressed. We identify a number of Young
Stellar Objects which are probable members of these clusters. This new material
is then used to revisit the spiral structure in this sector of the Galaxy
showing evidence of populations associated with the inner Galaxy Scutum-Crux
arm.
