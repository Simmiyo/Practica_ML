Photoionization of High Altitude Gas in a Supernova-Driven Turbulent
  Interstellar Medium
We investigate models for the photoionization of the widespread diffuse
ionized gas in galaxies. In particular we address the long standing question of
the penetration of Lyman continuum photons from sources close to the galactic
midplane to large heights in the galactic halo. We find that recent
hydrodynamical simulations of a supernova-driven interstellar medium have low
density paths and voids that allow for ionizing photons from midplane OB stars
to reach and ionize gas many kiloparsecs above the midplane. We find ionizing
fluxes throughout our simulation grids are larger than predicted by one
dimensional slab models, thus allowing for photoionization by O stars of low
altitude neutral clouds in the Galaxy that are also detected in Halpha. In
previous studies of such clouds the photoionization scenario had been rejected
and the Halpha had been attributed to enhanced cosmic ray ionization or
scattered light from midplane H II regions. We do find that the emission
measure distributions in our simulations are wider than those derived from
Halpha observations in the Milky Way. In addition, the horizontally averaged
height dependence of the gas density in the hydrodynamical models is lower than
inferred in the Galaxy. These discrepancies are likely due to the absence of
magnetic fields in the hydrodynamic simulations and we discuss how
magnetohydrodynamic effects may reconcile models and observations.
Nevertheless, we anticipate that the inclusion of magnetic fields in the
dynamical simulations will not alter our primary finding that midplane OB stars
are capable of producing high altitude diffuse ionized gas in a realistic
three-dimensional interstellar medium.
