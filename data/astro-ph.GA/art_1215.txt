Absolute proper motion of the Galactic open cluster M67
We derived the absolute proper motion (PM) of the old, solar-metallicity
Galactic open cluster M67 using observations collected with CFHT (1997) and
with LBT (2007). About 50 galaxies with relatively sharp nuclei allow us to
determine the absolute PM of the cluster. We find (mu_alpha
cos(delta),mu_delta)_J2000.0 = (-9.6+/-1.1,-3.7+/-0.8) mas/yr. By adopting a
line-of-sight velocity of 33.8+/-0.2 km/s, and assuming a distance of 815+/-50
pc, we explore the influence of the Galactic potential, with and without the
bar and/or spiral arms, on the galactic orbit of the cluster.
