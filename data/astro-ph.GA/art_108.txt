Stellar over-densities in the halo: the extent of the Virgo over-density
We map the three dimensional extent of the Virgo Over-density by combining
distance information from RR Lyrae variables and projected spatial information
from SEKBO (Keller et al. 2008) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR6
photometry. The Virgo Over-density is seen to comprise two filaments 14.5 x 3
degrees and 10 x 3 degrees and a circular structure 3 degrees in diameter.
Together the three features span 38 degrees of right ascension and declinations
of +2 to -15 degrees. RR Lyrae variables place the two filamentary features at
heliocentric distances of 20 and 17 kpc respectively, with projected dimensions
of 5 x 1 kpc and 3 x 1 kpc.
