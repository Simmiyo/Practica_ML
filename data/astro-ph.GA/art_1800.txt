Taurus stars membership in Pleiades open cluster
In this paper, we study the characteristics and physical properties of the
young open cluster Pleiades (NGC 1432; M45; Melotte 22; Seven Sisters) using
Near Infra Red, JHK pass bands. Our results have been compared with those found
in optical, UBV, newly observations. The membership validity of some variable
binary stars, which are Located in Taurus constellation, and their relation
with Pleiades cluster have been achieved.
