Expanded VLA Detection of 36.2 GHz Class I Methanol Masers in
  Sagittarius A
We report on the interferometric detection of 36.2 GHz Class I methanol
emission with the new 27-40 GHz Ka band receivers available on the Expanded
Very Large Array (EVLA). The brightness temperatures of the interferometric 36
GHz detections unambiguously indicate for the first time that the emission is
maser emission. The 36 GHz methanol masers are not co-spatial with 1720 MHz OH
masers, indicating that the two species trace different shocks. The 36 GHz and
44 GHz methanol masers, which both are collisionally pumped, do not necessarily
co-exist and may trace different methanol gas. The methanol masers seem
correlated with NH_3(3,3) density peaks. We favor an explanation in which the
36 GHz Class I methanol masers outline regions of cloud-cloud collisions,
perhaps just before the onset of the formation of individual massive stars.
  The transition of the Very Large Array (VLA) to the EVLA is well under way,
and these detections demonstrate the bright future of this completely renewed
instrument.
