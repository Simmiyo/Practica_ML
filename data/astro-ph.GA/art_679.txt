The Galactic thin and thick discs in the context of galaxy formation
We have obtained high-resolution spectra and carried out a detailed elemental
abundance analysis for a new sample of 899 F and G dwarf stars in the Solar
neighbourhood. The results allow us to, in a multi-dimensional space consisting
of stellar ages, detailed elemental abundances, and full kinematic information
for the stars, study and trace their respective origins. Here we briefly
address selection criteria and discuss how to define a thick disc star. The
results are discussed in the context of galaxy formation.
