The dynamics of the bulge dominated galaxy NGC 7814 in MOND
The bulge dominated galaxy NGC 7814 provides one of the strongest dynamical
tests possible for Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). Spitzer 3.6 micron
photometry fixes the bulge parameterisation and strongly constrains the
properties of the sub-dominant stellar disk. Furthermore, the distance is known
to better than 5 percent, virtually eliminating it as a free parameter. The
rotation curve is easily measured, since the H I (and stellar) disks are edge
on, and both the receding and approaching sides agree very well. In this paper
we explore the agreement between the model and observed rotation curves in MOND
given that the only two free parameters available are the mass-to-light ratios
of the bulge and disk. We use a grid based MOND Poisson solver that accurately
solves for the MOND gravity and produces our model rotation curves from a given
mass distribution. The input to the Poisson solver is a 3D distribution of N
particles which is generated from modelling the observed distribution of stars
and gas in the galaxy. By ensuring a superior fit to the radial surface
brightness profile than previous works, by virtue of a double Sersic fit to the
bulge, we were able to produce excellent fits to the rotation curve with
typical values for both mass-to-light ratios. We conclude that the model
rotation curve of a mass distribution in MOND is extremely sensitive to the
bulge-disk decomposition and even slight deviation from the observed mass
distribution can produce large differences in the model rotation curve.
