Indirect ultraviolet photodesorption from CO:N2 binary ices - an
  efficient grain-gas process
UV ice photodesorption is an important non-thermal desorption pathway in many
interstellar environments that has been invoked to explain observations of cold
molecules in disks, clouds and cloud cores. Systematic laboratory studies of
the photodesorption rates, between 7 and 14 eV, from CO:N2 binary ices, have
been performed at the DESIRS vacuum UV beamline of the synchrotron facility
SOLEIL. The photodesorption spectral analysis demonstrates that the
photodesorption process is indirect, i.e. the desorption is induced by a photon
absorption in sub-surface molecular layers, while only surface molecules are
actually desorbing. The photodesorption spectra of CO and N2 in binary ices
therefore depend on the absorption spectra of the dominant species in the
subsurface ice layer, which implies that the photodesorption efficiency and
energy dependence are dramatically different for mixed and layered ices
compared to pure ices. In particular, a thin (1-2 ML) N2 ice layer on top of CO
will effectively quench CO photodesorption, while enhancing N2 photodesorption
by a factors of a few (compared to the pure ices) when the ice is exposed to a
typical dark cloud UV field, which may help to explain the different
distributions of CO and N2H+ in molecular cloud cores. This indirect
photodesorption mechanism may also explain observations of small amounts of
complex organics in cold interstellar environments.
