Local stellar kinematics from RAVE data: III. Radial and Vertical
  Metallicity Gradients based on Red Clump Stars
We investigate radial and vertical metallicity gradients for a sample of red
clump stars from the RAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) Data Release 3. We
select a total of 6781 stars, using a selection of colour, surface gravity and
uncertainty in the derived space motion, and calculate for each star a
probabilistic (kinematic) population assignment to a thin or thick disc using
space motion and additionally another (dynamical) assignment using stellar
vertical orbital eccentricity. We derive almost equal metallicity gradients as
a function of Galactocentric distance for the high probability thin disc stars
and for stars with vertical orbital eccentricities consistent with being
dynamically young, e_v<=0.07, i.e. d[M/H]/dR_m = -0.041(0.003) and d[M/H]/dR_m
= -0.041(0.007) dex/kpc. Metallicity gradients as a function of distance from
the Galactic plane for the same populations are steeper, i.e. d[M/H]/dz_{max} =
-0.109(0.008) and d[M/H]/dz_{max} = -0.260(0.031) dex/kpc, respectively. R_m
and z_{max} are the arithmetic mean of the perigalactic and apogalactic
distances, and the maximum distance to the Galactic plane, respectively.
Samples including more thick disc red clump giant stars show systematically
shallower abundance gradients. These findings can be used to distinguish
between different formation scenarios of the thick and thin discs.
