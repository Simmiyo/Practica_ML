The nebulae around LBVs: a multiwavelength approach
We present first results of our study of a sample of Galactic LBV, aimed to
contribute to a better understanding of the LBV phenomenon, by recovering the
mass-loss history of the central object from the analysis of its associated
nebula. Mass-loss properties have been derived by a synergistic use of
different techniques, at different wavelengths, to obtain high-resolution,
multi-wavelength maps, tracing the different emitting components coexisting in
the stellar ejecta: the ionized/neutral gas and the dust. Evidence for
asymmetric mass-loss and observational evidence of possible mutual interaction
between gas and dust components have been observed by the comparison of mid-IR
(Spitzer/IRAC, VLT/VISIR) and radio (VLA) images of the nebulae, while
important information on the gas and dust composition have been derived from
Spitzer/IRS spectra.
