Interstellar Turbulence and Star Formation
We provide a brief overview of recent advances and outstanding issues in
simulations of interstellar turbulence, including isothermal models for
interior structure of molecular clouds and larger-scale multiphase models
designed to simulate the formation of molecular clouds. We show how
self-organization in highly compressible magnetized turbulence in the
multiphase ISM can be exploited in simple numerical models to generate
realistic initial conditions for star formation.
