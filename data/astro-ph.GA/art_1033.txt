Mopra line survey mapping of NGC6334I and I(N) at 3mm
A 5'x5' region encompassing NGC6334I and I(N) has been mapped at a wavelength
of 3mm (from 83.5 to 115.5GHz) with the Mopra telescope at an angular
resolution between 33 arcsec and 36 arcsec. This investigation has made use of
the recently installed 3mm MMIC receiver and the Mopra Spectrometer (MOPS) with
broadband capabilities permitting total coverage of the entire frequency range
with just five different observations. In total, the spatial distribution of
nineteen different molecules, ions and radicals, along with additional selected
isotopologues have been studied. Whilst most species trace the sites of star
formation, CH_3CN appears to be most closely associated with NGC6334I and I(N).
Both CN and C_2H appear to be widespread, tracing gas that is not associated
with active star formation. Both N_2H^+ and HC_3N closely resemble dust
continuum emission, showing they are reliable tracers of dense material, as
well as the youngest stages of high mass star formation. Hot (E_u/k>100K)
thermal CH_3OH emission is preferentially found towards NGC6334I, contrasting
with I(N), where only cold (E_u/k<22K) thermal CH_3OH emission is found.
