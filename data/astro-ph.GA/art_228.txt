Pre-nova X-ray observations of V2491 Cyg (Nova Cyg 2008b)
Classical novae are phenomena caused by explosive hydrogen burning on an
accreting white dwarf. So far, only one classical nova has been identified in
X-rays before the actual optical outburst occurred (V2487 Oph). The recently
discovered nova, V2491 Cyg, is one of the fastest (He/N) novae observed so far.
Using archival ROSAT, XMM-Newton and Swift data, we show that V2491 Cyg was a
persistent X-ray source during its quiescent time before the optical outburst.
We present the X-ray spectral characteristics and derive X-ray fluxes. The
pre-outburst X-ray emission is variable, and at least in one observation it
shows a very soft X-ray source.
