Ionized Gas in the Smith Cloud
We present WHAM observations of Halpha, [N II], and [S II] in the Smith
Cloud. A map of Halpha emission from the cloud shows ionized gas coincident
with the brightest H I emission, but nearly-as-bright Halpha in some regions
with faint H I. The ionized mass of the cloud is at least as large as the
neutral mass, > 10^6 M_sun. Ionized gas in the core of the Smith Cloud has an
electron temperature 6000 K < T < 16000 K. The observed ratio [N II] / Halpha =
0.39 \pm 0.09 shows that the cloud has a non-primordial nitrogen abundance, 0.1
- 1 times solar.
