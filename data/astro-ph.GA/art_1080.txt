The environment of the infrared dust bubble N65: a mutiwavelength study
AIMS: We investigate the environment of the infrared dust bubble N65 and
search for evidence of triggered star formation in its surroundings. METHODS:
We performed a multiwavelength study of the region around N65 with data taken
from large-scale surveys: Two Micron All Sky Survey, GLIMPSE, MIPSGAL, SCUBA,
and GRS. We analyzed the distribution of the molecular gas and dust in the
environment of N65 and performed infrared photometry and spectral analysis of
point sources to search for young stellar objects and identify the ionizing
star candidates. RESULTS: We found a molecular cloud that appears to be
fragmented into smaller clumps along the N65 PDR. This indicates that the
so-called collect and collapse process may be occurring. Several young stellar
objects are distributed among the molecular clumps. They may represent a second
generation of stars whose formation was triggered by the bubble expanding into
the molecular gas. We dentified O-type stars inside N65, which are the most
reliable ionizing star candidates.
