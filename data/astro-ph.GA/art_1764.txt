Estimation of C II and C II* column densities along Galactic sight-lines
We present interstellar C II (1334.5323 \AA) and C II* (1335.7077 \AA) column
density measurements along 14 Galactic sight-lines. These sight-lines sample a
variety of Galactic disk environments and include paths that range nearly two
orders of magnitude in average hydrogen densities (<n(H)>) along the lines of
sight. Five of the sight-lines show super-Solar gas phase abundances of carbon.
Our results show that the excess carbon along these sight-lines may result from
different mechanisms taking place in the regions associated with these stars.
