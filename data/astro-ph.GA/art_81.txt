Spatially Resolved Galaxy Star Formation and its Environmental
  Dependence II. Effect of the Morphology-Density Relation
In this second of a series of papers on spatially resolved star formation, we
investigate the impact of the density-morphology relation of galaxies on the
spatial variation of star formation (SF) and its dependence on environment. We
find that while a density-morphology relation is present for the sample, it
cannot solely explain the observed suppression of SF in galaxies in
high-density environments. We also find that early-type and late-type galaxies
exhibit distinct radial star formation rate (SFR) distributions, with
early-types having a SFR distribution that extends further relative to the
galaxy scale length, compared to late-types at all densities. We find that a
suppression of SF in the highest density environments is found in the highest
star forming galaxies for both galaxy types. This suppression occurs in the
innermost regions in late-types (r <= 0.125 Petrosian radii), and further out
in radius in early-types (0.125< r <= 0.25 Petrosian radii). When the full
sample is considered no clear suppression of SF is detected, indicating that
the environmental trends are driven only by the highest SF galaxies. We
demonstrate that the density-morphology relation alone cannot account for the
suppression of SF in the highest density environments. This points to an
environmentally-governed evolutionary mechanism that affects the SF in the
innermost regions in both early and late-type galaxies. We suggest that this is
a natural consequence of the "downsizing" of SF in galaxies.
