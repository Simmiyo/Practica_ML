CO J=1-0 observations of molecular gas interacting with galactic
  supernova remnants G5.4-1.2, G5.55+0.32 and G5.71-0.08
The field just West of the galactic supernova remnant W28
  (l=6.4\degr, b=-0.2\degr) harbors 3 of 5 newly-discovered 1720 OH maser spots
and two recently-discovered candidate supernova candidates (one of which is a
$\gamma$-ray source), as well as several compact and classical HII regions.
Here, we analyze a datacube of CO J=1-0 emission having 1\arcmin and 1 \kms
resolution, made with on-the-fly mapping over the region $5\degr \le l \le
6\degr, -1\degr \le b \le 0.5\degr$}. {Extended and often very bright CO
emission was detected at the velocities of the 1720 MHz OH masers and around
the supernova remnant G5.55+0.32 which lacks a maser. A new bipolar outflow
which is marginally resolved at 1\arcmin resolution and strong in CO (12K) was
detected at the periphery of G5.55+0.32, coincident with an MSX source; there
is also a bright rim of CO just beyond the periphery of the radio remnant. The
OH maser near G5.71-0.08 lies on a shell of strongly-emitting molecular gas (up
to 20K) . At the -21 \kms velocity of G5.4-1.2, CO covers much of the field but
is weak (3 K) and undisturbed near the remnant. The extended molecular gas
around the compact H II region and outflow in G5.89-0.39 (W28A2) is shown for
the first time.}
