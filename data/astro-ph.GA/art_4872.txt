Discovery of a tidal dwarf galaxy in the Leo Triplet
We report discovery of a dwarf galaxy in the Leo Triplet. Analysis of the
neutral hydrogen distribution shows that it rotates independently of the tidal
tail of NGC 3628, with a radial velocity gradient of 35-40 km s$^{-1}$ over
approximately 13 kpc. The galaxy has a very high neutral gas content,
explaining large part of its total dynamic mass - suggesting small dark matter
content. As it is located at the tip of the gaseous tail, this strongly
suggests its tidal origin. Should it be the case, it would be one of the most
confident and closest (to the Milky Way) detections of a tidal dwarf galaxy
and, at the same time, a most detached from its parent galaxy ($\approx$140
kpc) object of this type.
