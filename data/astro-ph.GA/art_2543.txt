A Photometric Study of Five Open Clusters in the SDSS
We present a photometric study of five open clusters (Czernik 5, Alessi 53,
Berkeley 49, Berkeley 84, and Pfleiderer 3) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
The position and size of these clusters are determined using the radial number
density profiles of the stars, and the member stars of the clusters are
selected using the proper motion data in the literature. We estimate the
reddening, distance, and age of the clusters based on the isochrone fitting in
the color-magnitude diagram. The foreground reddenings for these clusters are
estimated to be E(B-V) = 0.71 - 1.55 mag. The distances to these clusters are
derived to be 2.0 - 4.4 kpc, and their distances from the Galactic center range
from 7.57 kpc to 12.35 kpc. Their ages are in the range from 250 Myr to 1 Gyr.
Berkeley 49 and Berkeley 84 are located in the Orion spur, Czernik 5 is in the
Perseus arm, and Pfleiderer 3 and Alessi 53 are at beyond the Perseus arm.
