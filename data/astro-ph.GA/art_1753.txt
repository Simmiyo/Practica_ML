Physical Properties of Complex C Halo Clouds
Observations from the Galactic Arecibo L-Band Feed Array HI (GALFA-HI) Survey
of the tail of Complex C are presented and the halo clouds associated with this
complex cataloged. The properties of the Complex C clouds are compared to
clouds cataloged at the tail of the Magellanic Stream to provide insight into
the origin and destruction mechanism of Complex C. Magellanic Stream and
Complex C clouds show similarities in their mass distributions (slope = -0.7
and -0.6, respectively) and have a common linewidth of 20 - 30 km/s (indicative
of a warm component), which may indicate a common origin and/or physical
process breaking down the clouds. The clouds cataloged at the tail of Complex C
extend over a mass range of 10^1.1 to 10^4.8 solar masses, sizes of 10^1.2 to
10^2.6 pc, and have a median volume density of 0.065 cm^(-3) and median
pressure of (P/k) = 580 K cm^{-3}. We do not see a prominent two-phase
structure in Complex C, possibly due to its low metallicity and inefficient
cooling compared to other halo clouds. From assuming the Complex C clouds are
in pressure equilibrium with a hot halo medium, we find a median halo density
of 5.8 x 10^(-4) cm^(-3), which given a constant distance of 10 kpc, is at a
z-height of ~3 kpc. Using the same argument for the Stream results in a median
halo density of 8.4 x 10^(-5) x (60kpc/d) cm^(-3). These densities are
consistent with previous observational constraints and cosmological
simulations. We also assess the derived cloud and halo properties with three
dimensional grid simulations of halo HI clouds and find the temperature is
generally consistent within a factor of 1.5 and the volume densities, pressures
and halo densities are consistent within a factor of 3.
