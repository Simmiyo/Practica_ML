AKARI Infrared Observations of the Supernova Remnant G292.0+1.8:
  Unveiling Circumstellar Medium and Supernova Ejecta
We present the results of AKARI observations of the O-rich supernova remnant
G292.0+1.8 using six IRC and four FIS bands covering 2.7-26.5 um and 50-180 um,
respectively. The AKARI images show two prominent structures; a bright
equatorial ring structure and an outer elliptical shell structure. The
equatorial ring structure is clumpy and incomplete with its western end opened.
The outer shell is almost complete and slightly squeezed along the north-south
direction. The central position of the outer shell is ~ 1' northwest from the
embedded pulsar and coincides with the center of the equatorial ring structure.
The equatorial ring and the elliptical shell structures were partly visible in
optical and/or X-rays, but they are much more clearly revealed in our AKARI
images. There is no evident difference in infrared colors of the two prominent
structures, which is consistent with the previous proposition that both
structures are of circumstellar origin. However, we have detected faint
infrared emission of a considerably high 15 to 24 um ratio associated with the
supernova ejecta in the southeastern and northwestern areas. Our IRC spectra
show that the high ratio is at least partly due to the emission lines from Ne
ions in the supernova ejecta material. In addition we detect a narrow,
elongated feature outside the SNR shell. We derive the physical parameters of
the infrared-emitting dust grains in the shocked circumstellar medium and
compare the result with model calculations of dust destruction by a SN shock.
The AKARI results suggest that the progenitor was at the center of the infrared
circumstellar shell in red supergiant stage and that the observed asymmetry in
the SN ejecta could be a result of either a dense circumstellar medium in the
equatorial plane and/or an asymmetric explosion.
