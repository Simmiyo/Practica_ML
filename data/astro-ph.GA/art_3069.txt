A rotating molecular jet from a Perseus protostar
We present $^{12}$CO(2-1) line and 1.4 mm continuum archival observations,
made with the Submillimeter Array, of the outflow HH 797 located in the IC 348
cluster in Perseus. The continuum emission is associated with a circumstellar
disk surrounding the class 0 object IC 348-MMS/SMM2, a very young solar analog.
The line emission, on the other hand, delineates a collimated outflow, and
reveals velocity asymmetries about the flow axis over the entire length of the
flow. The amplitude of velocity differences is of order 2 km s$^{-1}$ over
distances of about 1000 AU, and we interpret them as evidence for jet rotation
--although we also discuss alternative possibilities. A comparison with
theoretical models suggests that the magnetic field lines threading the
protostellar jet might be anchored to the disk of a radius of about 20 AU.
