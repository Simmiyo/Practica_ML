An Anisotropic Propagation Model for Galactic Cosmic Rays
Isotropic diffusion models for Galactic cosmic ray transport put tight
constraints on the maximum convection velocity in the halo. For a half halo
height of 4 kpc the maximum convection speed is limited to 40 km/s in the halo,
since otherwise the constraints from local secondary to primary ratios and
radioactive isotopes cannot be met. The ROSAT Galactic wind observations of
wind speeds up to 760 km/s therefore constitute a problem for diffusion models.
It is shown that such wind speeds are possible, if the diffusion coefficient in
the halo is different from the diffusion coefficient in the disk. The radial
dependence of the wind velocity was taken to be proportional to the source
strength, as expected from winds which are sustained by cosmic ray pressure. In
this case the cosmic ray density and with it the diffuse $\gamma$-ray
production from nuclear interactions are suppressed near the sources. This
solves in a natural way the problem of the soft gradient in the radial
dependence of the $\gamma$-ray flux. Furthermore, the large bulge over disk
ratio in positron annihilation as observed by INTEGRAL, can be explained by
positron escape from the disk in such a model.
