29 Glitches Detected at Urumqi Observatory
Glitches detected in pulsar timing observations at the Nanshan radio
telescope of Urumqi Observatory between 2002 July and 2008 December are
presented. In total, 29 glitches were detected in 19 young pulsars, with this
being the first detection of a glitch in 12 of these pulsars. Fractional glitch
amplitudes range from a few parts in 10^{-11} to 3.9 x 10^{-6}. Three "slow"
glitches are identified in PSRs J0631+1036, B1822-09 and B1907+10. Post-glitch
recoveries differ greatly from pulsar to pulsar and for different glitches in
the same pulsar. Most large glitches show some evidence for exponential
post-glitch recovery on timescales of 100 -- 1000 days, but in some cases,
e.g., PSR B1758-23, there is little or no recovery. Beside exponential
recoveries, permanent increases in slowdown rate are seen for the two large
glitches in PSRs B1800-21 and B1823-13. These and several other pulsars also
show a linear increase in nudot following the partial exponential recovery,
which is similar to the Vela pulsar post-glitch behaviour. Analysis of the
whole sample of known glitches show that fractional glitch amplitudes are
correlated with characteristic age with a peak at about 10^5 years, but there
is a spread of two or three orders of magnitude at all ages. Glitch activity is
positively correlated with spin-down rate, again with a wide spread of values.
