Numerical study of Cosmic Ray Diffusion in MHD turbulence
We study diffusion of Cosmic Rays (CRs) in turbulent magnetic fields using
test particle simulations. Electromagnetic fields are produced in direct
numerical MHD simulations of turbulence and used as an input for particle
tracing, particle feedback on turbulence being ignored. Statistical transport
coefficients from the test particle runs are compared with earlier analytical
predictions. We find qualitative correspondence between them in various aspects
of CR diffusion. In the incompressible case, that we consider in this paper,
the dominant scattering mechanism occurs to be the non-resonant mirror
interactions with the slow-mode perturbations. Perpendicular transport roughly
agrees with being produced by magnetic field wandering.
