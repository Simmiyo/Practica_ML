MUSTANG 3.3 Millimeter Continuum Observations of Class 0 Protostars
We present observations of six Class 0 protostars at 3.3 mm (90 GHz) using
the 64-pixel MUSTANG bolometer camera on the 100-m Green Bank Telescope. The
3.3 mm photometry is analyzed along with shorter wavelength observations to
derive spectral indices (S_nu ~ nu^alpha) of the measured emission. We utilize
previously published dust continuum radiative transfer models to estimate the
characteristic dust temperature within the central beam of our observations. We
present constraints on the millimeter dust opacity index, beta, between 0.862
mm, 1.25 mm, and 3.3 mm. Beta_mm typically ranges from 1.0 to 2.4 for Class 0
sources. The relative contributions from disk emission and envelope emission
are estimated at 3.3 mm. L483 is found to have negligible disk emission at 3.3
mm while L1527 is dominated by disk emission within the central beam. The
beta_mm^disk <= 0.8 - 1.4 for L1527 indicates that grain growth is likely
occurring in the disk. The photometry presented in this paper may be combined
with future interferometric observations of Class 0 envelopes and disks.
