On the Distance and Age of the Pulsar Wind Nebula 3C58
There is a growing community of astronomers presenting evidence that the
pulsar wind nebula 3C58 is much older than the connection with the historical
supernova of A.D 1181 would indicate. Most of the strong evidence against a
young age for 3C58 relies heavily on the assumed distance of 3.2 kpc determined
with HI absorption measurements. I have revisited this distance determination
based on new HI data from the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey and added newly
determined distances to objects in the neighbourhood, which are based on direct
measurements by trigonometric parallax. This leads to a new more reliable
distance estimate of 2 kpc for 3C58 and makes the connection between the pulsar
wind nebula and the historical event from A.D. 1181 once again much more
compelling.
