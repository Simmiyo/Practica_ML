Two-component jet simulations: II. Combining analytical disk and stellar
  MHD outflow solutions
Theoretical arguments along with observational data of YSO jets suggest the
presence of two steady components: a disk wind type outflow needed to explain
the observed high mass loss rates and a stellar wind type outflow probably
accounting for the observed stellar spin down.
  Each component's contribution depends on the intrinsic physical properties of
the YSO-disk system and its evolutionary stage. The main goal of this paper is
to understand some of the basic features of the evolution, interaction and
co-existence of the two jet components over a parameter space and when time
variability is enforced. Having studied separately the numerical evolution of
each type of the complementary disk and stellar analytical wind solutions in
Paper I of this series, we proceed here to mix together the two models inside
the computational box. The evolution in time is performed with the PLUTO code,
investigating the dynamics of the two-component jets, the modifications each
solution undergoes and the potential steady state reached.
