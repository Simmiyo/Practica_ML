Self-organization in Turbulent Molecular Clouds: Compressional versus
  Solenoidal Modes
We use three-dimensional numerical simulations to study self-organization in
supersonic turbulence in molecular clouds. Our numerical experiments describe
decaying and driven turbulent flows with an isothermal equation of state, sonic
Mach numbers from 2 to 10, and various degrees of magnetization. We focus on
properties of the velocity field and, specifically, on the level of its
potential (dilatational) component as a function of turbulent Mach number,
magnetic field strength, and scale. We show how extreme choices of either
purely solenoidal or purely potential forcing can reduce the extent of the
inertial range in the context of periodic box models for molecular cloud
turbulence. We suggest an optimized forcing to maximize the effective Reynolds
number in numerical models.
