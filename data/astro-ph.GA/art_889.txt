Mapping the Asymmetric Thick Disk I. A Search for Triaxiality
A significant asymmetry in the distribution of faint blue stars in the inner
Galaxy, Quadrant 1 (l = 20 to 45 degrees) compared to Quadrant 4 was first
reported by Larsen & Humphreys (1996). Parker et al (2003, 2004) greatly
expanded the survey to determine its spatial extent and shape and the
kinematics of the affected stars. This excess in the star counts was
subsequently confirmed by Juric et al. (2008) using SDSS data. Possible
explanations for the asymmetry include a merger remnant, a triaxial Thick Disk,
and a possible interaction with the bar in the Disk. In this paper we describe
our program of wide field photometry to map the asymmetry to fainter magnitudes
and therefore larger distances. To search for the signature of triaxiality, we
extended our survey to higher Galactic longitudes. We find no evidence for an
excess of faint blue stars at l > 55 degrees including the faintest magnitude
interval. The asymmetry and star count excess in Quadrant 1 is thus not due to
a triaxial Thick Disk.
