Fundamental Properties of the Highly Ionized Plasmas in the Milky Way
The cooling transition temperature gas in the interstellar medium (ISM),
traced by the high ions, Si IV, C IV, N V, and O VI, helps to constrain the
flow of energy from the hot ISM with T >10^6 K to the warm ISM with T< 2x10^4
K. We investigate the properties of this gas along the lines of sight to 38
stars in the Milky Way disk using 1.5-2.7 km/s resolution spectra of Si IV, C
IV, and N V absorption from the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS),
and 15 km/s resolution spectra of O VI absorption from the Far Ultraviolet
Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE). The absorption by Si IV and C IV exhibits broad
and narrow components while only broad components are seen in N V and O VI. The
narrow components imply gas with T<7x10^4 K and trace two distinct types of
gas. The strong, saturated, and narrow Si IV and C IV components trace the gas
associated with the vicinities of O-type stars and their supershells. The
weaker narrow Si IV and C IV components trace gas in the general ISM that is
photoionized by the EUV radiation from cooling hot gas or has radiatively
cooled in a non-equilibrium manner from the transition temperature phase, but
rarely the warm ionized medium (WIM) probed by Al III. The broad Si IV, C IV, N
V, and O VI components trace collisionally ionized gas that is very likely
undergoing a cooling transition from the hot ISM to the warm ISM. The cooling
process possibly provides the regulation mechanism that produces N(C IV)/N(Si
IV) = 3.9 +/- 1.9. The cooling process also produces absorption lines where the
median and mean values of the line widths increase with the energy required to
create the ion.
