The Monoceros radio loop: temperature, brightness, spectral index and
  distance
In this paper we estimated the temperatures and brightnesses of the Monoceros
radio loop at 1420, 820 and 408 MHz. Linear spectrum is estimated for mean
temperatures versus frequency between 1420, 820 and 408 MHz. The spectral index
of Monoceros loop is also obtained. The brightness temperatures and surface
brightnesses of the loop are computed using data taken from radio-continuum
surveys at the three frequencies. The spectral index of the loop is also
obtained from $T-T$ plots between 1420 - 820, 1420 - 408 and 820 - 408 MHz. The
obtained results confirm non-thermal origin of the Monoceros radio loop.
