A Shared Tully-Fisher Relation for Spiral and S0 Galaxies
We measure the Tully-Fisher relations of 14 lenticular galaxies (S0s) and 14
spirals. We use two measures of rotational velocity. One is derived directly
from observed spatially-resolved stellar kinematics and the other from the
circular velocities of mass models that include a dark halo and whose
parameters are constrained by detailed kinematic modelling. Contrary to the
naive expectations of theories of S0 formation, we find no significant
difference between the Tully-Fisher relations of the two samples when plotted
as functions of both brightness and stellar mass.
