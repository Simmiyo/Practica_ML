Multiplicity of nuclear dust lanes and dust lane shocks in the Milky Way
  bar
Aims: We show the existence of a small family of inner-galaxy dust lanes and
dust lane standing shocks beyond the two major ones that were previously known
to exist Methods: We analyze images of CO emission in the inner regions of the
Galaxy Results: The peculiar kinematics of the major dust lane features are
repeated in several other distinct instances at l > 0deg, in one case at a
contrary location 100 pc above the galactic equator at l > 3degr at the upper
extremity of Clump 2. Like the previously-known dust lanes, these new examples
are alsoassociated with localized, exceptionally broad line profiles believed
to be characteristic of the shredding of neutral gas at the standing dust lane
shocks. Conclusions: There may be secondary dust lane and standing shocks in
the Milky Way bulge. The vertical structure provides a temporal sequence for
understanding the secular evolution of gas flow in the bar.
