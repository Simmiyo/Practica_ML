Aperiodic optical variability of intermediate polars - cataclysmic
  variables with truncated accretion disks
We study the power spectra of the variability of seven intermediate polars
containing magnetized asynchronous accreting white dwarfs, XSS J00564+4548,IGR
J00234+6141, DO Dra, V1223 Sgr, IGR J15094-6649, IGR J16500-3307 and IGR
J17195-4100, in the optical band and demonstrate that their variability can be
well described by a model based on fluctuations propagating in a truncated
accretion disk. The power spectra have breaks at Fourier frequencies, which we
associate with the Keplerian frequency of the disk at the boundary of the white
dwarfs' magnetospheres. We propose that the properties of the optical power
spectra can be used to deduce the geometry of the inner parts of the accretion
disk, in particular: 1) truncation radii of the magnetically disrupted
accretion disks in intermediate polars, 2) the truncation radii of the
accretion disk in quiescent states of dwarf novae
