A Corona Australis cloud filament seen in NIR scattered light II:
  Comparison with sub-millimeter data
We study a northern part of the Corona Australis molecular cloud that
consists of a filament and a dense sub-millimetre core inside the filament. Our
aim is to measure dust temperature and sub-mm emissivity within the region. We
also look for confirmation that near-infrared (NIR) surface brightness can be
used to study the structure of even very dense clouds. We extend our previous
NIR mapping south of the filament. The dust colour temperatures are estimated
using Spitzer 160um and APEX/Laboca 870um maps. The column densities derived
based on the reddening of background stars, NIR surface brightness, and thermal
sub-mm dust emission are compared. A three dimensional toy model of the
filament is used to study the effect of anisotropic illumination on
near-infrared surface brightness and the reliability of dust temperature
determination. Relative to visual extinction, the estimated emissivity at 870um
is kappa(870) = (1.3 +- 0.4) x 10^{-5} 1/mag. This is similar to the values
found in diffuse medium. A significant increase in the sub-millimetre
emissivity seems to be excluded. In spite of saturation, NIR surface brightness
was able to accurately pinpoint, and better than measurements of the colour
excesses of background stars, the exact location of the column density maximum.
Both near- and far-infrared data show that the intensity of the radiation field
is higher south of the filament.
