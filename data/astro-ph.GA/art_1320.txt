On the self-similar motion of a gravitating Chaplygin fluid
A self-similar motion of the generalized Chaplygin gas in its own
gravitational field is considered. The problem is being studied numerically and
analytically (in the limiting cases). It is shown that the model under
consideration admits only expanding solutions. As the astrophysical application
of the model, a description of rotating curves of spiral galaxies is suggested
by using the analytical solutions obtained in the paper.
