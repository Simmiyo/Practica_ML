SEGUE: A Spectroscopic Survey of 240,000 stars with g=14-20
The SEGUE survey obtained 240,000 moderate resolution (R = 1800) spectra from
3900 - 9000 Angstroms of fainter Milky Way stars (14.0 < g < 20.3) of a wide
variety of spectral types, both main sequence and evolved objects, with the
goal of studying the kinematics and populations of our Galaxy and its halo. The
spectra are clustered in 212 regions spaced over three-quarters of the sky.
Radial velocity accuracies for stars are 4 km/s at g < 18, degrading to 15 km/s
at g = 20. For stars with S/N > 10 per resolution element, stellar atmospheric
parameters are estimated, including metallicity, surface gravity, and effective
temperature. SEGUE obtained 3500 square degrees of additional ugriz imaging
(primarily at low Galactic latitudes) providing precise multi-color photometry
(g,r,i = 2%), (u,z = 3%) and astrometry (0.1 arcsec) for spectroscopic target
selection. The stellar spectra, imaging data, and derived parameter catalogs
for this survey are publicly available as part of SDSS Data Release 7 (DR7).
