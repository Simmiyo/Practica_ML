The origin of very wide binary systems
The majority of stars in the Galactic field and halo are part of binary or
multiple systems. A significant fraction of these systems have orbital
separations in excess of thousands of astronomical units, and systems wider
than a parsec have been identified in the Galactic halo. These binary systems
cannot have formed through the 'normal' star-formation process, nor by capture
processes in the Galactic field. We propose that these wide systems were formed
during the dissolution phase of young star clusters. We test this hypothesis
using N-body simulations of evolving star clusters and find wide binary
fractions of 1-30%, depending on initial conditions. Moreover, given that most
stars form as part of a binary system, our theory predicts that a large
fraction of the known wide 'binaries' are, in fact, multiple systems.
