Physical properties and evolutionary state of the Lyman alpha emitting
  starburst galaxy IRAS 08339+6517
Though Lyman alpha emission (Lya) is one of the most used tracers of massive
star formation at high redshift, a correct understanding of radiation transfer
effects by neutral gas is required to properly quantify the star formation rate
along the history of the Universe. We are embarked in a program to study the
properties of the Lya emission (spectral profile, spatial distribution,
relation to Balmer lines intensity,...) in several local starburst galaxies. We
present here the results obtained for IRAS 08339+6517.
  Using evolutionary population synthesis models, we have characterized the
properties of the starburst (UV continuum, Halpha, total infrared and X-ray
emissions, etc.), which transformed 1.4e+8 Mo of gas into stars around 5-6 Myr
ago. In addition to the central compact emission blob, we have identified a
diffuse Lya emission component smoothly distributed over the whole central area
of IRAS 08339+6517. This diffuse emission is spatially decoupled from the UV
continuum, the Halpha emission or the Halpha/Hbeta ratio. Both locally and
globally, the Lya/Halpha ratio is lower than the Case B predictions, even after
reddening correction, with an overall Lya escape fraction of only 4%.
  We conclude that in IRAS 08339+6517 the resonant scattering of Lya photons by
an outflowing shell of neutral gas causes their highly-efficient destruction by
dust, which explains the low Lya escape fraction measured. These results stress
again the importance of a proper correction of scattering and transfer effects
when using Lya to derive the star formation rate in high-redshift galaxies.
