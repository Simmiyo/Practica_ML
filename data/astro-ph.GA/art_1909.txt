Multifluid magnetohydrodynamic turbulent decay
It is generally believed that turbulence has a significant impact on the
dynamics and evolution of molecular clouds and the star formation which occurs
within them. Non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic effects are known to influence the
nature of this turbulence. We present the results of a suite of 512-cubed
resolution simulations of the decay of initially super-Alfvenic and supersonic
fully multifluid MHD turbulence. We find that ambipolar diffusion increases the
rate of decay of the turbulence while the Hall effect has virtually no impact.
The decay of the kinetic energy can be fitted as a power-law in time and the
exponent is found to be -1.34 for fully multifluid MHD turbulence. The power
spectra of density, velocity and magnetic field are all steepened significantly
by the inclusion of non-ideal terms. The dominant reason for this steepening is
ambipolar diffusion with the Hall effect again playing a minimal role except at
short length scales where it creates extra structure in the magnetic field.
Interestingly we find that, at least at these resolutions, the majority of the
physics of multifluid turbulence can be captured by simply introducing fixed
(in time and space) resistive terms into the induction equation without the
need for a full multifluid MHD treatment. The velocity dispersion is also
examined and, in common with previously published results, it is found not to
be power-law in nature.
