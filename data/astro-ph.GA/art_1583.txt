Group finding in the stellar halo using M-giants in 2MASS: An extended
  view of the Pisces Overdensity?
A density based hierarchical group-finding algorithm is used to identify
stellar halo structures in a catalog of M-giants from the Two Micron All Sky
Survey (2MASS). The intrinsic brightness of M-giant stars means that this
catalog probes deep into the halo where substructures are expected to be
abundant and easy to detect. Our analysis reveals 16 structures at high
Galactic latitude (greater than 15 degree), of which 10 have been previously
identified. Among the six new structures two could plausibly be due to masks
applied to the data, one is associated with a strong extinction region and one
is probably a part of the Monoceros ring. Another one originates at low
latitudes, suggesting some contamination from disk stars, but also shows
protrusions extending to high latitudes, implying that it could be a real
feature in the stellar halo. The last remaining structure is free from the
defects discussed above and hence is very likely a satellite remnant. Although
the extinction in the direction of the structure is very low, the structure
does match a low temperature feature in the dust maps. While this casts some
doubt on its origin, the low temperature feature could plausibly be due to real
dust in the structure itself. The angular position and distance of this
structure encompass the Pisces overdensity traced by RR Lyraes in Stripe 82 of
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). However, the 2MASS M-giants indicate that
the structure is much more extended than what is visible with the SDSS, with
the point of peak density lying just outside Stripe 82. The morphology of the
structure is more like a cloud than a stream and reminiscent of that seen in
simulations of satellites disrupting along highly eccentric orbits.
