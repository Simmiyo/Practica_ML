Themes and Questions about the Disk-Halo Interaction
The papers in this volume represent a broad spectrum of observational,
theoretical, and computational astrophysics, sharing as a unifying core the
Disk-Halo Interaction in the Milky Way and other spiral galaxies. This topic
covers a wide range of Galactic and extra-galactic research, built on a
foundation of numerous and diverse physical processes. This summary groups the
papers according to six themes, with some historical background and finally a
look to the future. The final message is that the astrophysical techniques
discussed and reviewed at this conference will grow over the next decade to
answer even more fundamental questions about galaxy evolution and the history
of the universe.
