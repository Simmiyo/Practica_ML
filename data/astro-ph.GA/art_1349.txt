New HST WFC3/UVIS observations augment the stellar-population complexity
  of omega Centauri
We used archival multi-band Hubble Space Telescope observations obtained with
the Wide-Field Camera 3 in the UV-optical channel to present new important
observational findings on the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of the Galactic
globular cluster omega Centauri. The ultraviolet WFC3 data have been coupled
with available WFC/ACS optical-band data. The new CMDs, obtained from the
combination of colors coming from eight different bands, disclose an even more
complex stellar population than previously identified. This paper discusses the
detailed morphology of the CMDs.
