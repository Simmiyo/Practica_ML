VLT/FLAMES-ARGUS observations of stellar wind--ISM cloud interactions in
  NGC 6357
We present optical/near-IR IFU observations of a gas pillar in the Galactic
HII region NGC 6357 containing the young open star cluster Pismis 24. These
observations have allowed us to examined in detail the gas conditions of the
strong wind-clump interactions taking place on its surface. We identify the
presence of a narrow (~20 km/s) and broad (50-150 km/s) component to the
H_alpha emission line, where the broadest broad component widths are found in a
region that follows the shape of the eastern pillar edge. These connections
have allowed us to firmly associate the broad component with emission from
ionized gas within turbulent mixing layers on the pillar's surface set up by
the shear flows of the O-star winds from the cluster. We discuss the
implications of our findings in terms of the broad emission line component that
is increasingly found in extragalactic starburst environments. Although the
broad line widths found here are narrower, we conclude that the mechanisms
producing both must be the same. The difference in line widths may result from
the lower total mechanical wind energy produced by the O stars in Pismis 24
compared to that from a typical young massive star cluster found in a starburst
galaxy. The pillar's edge is also clearly defined by dense (<5000 cm^-3), hot
(>20000 K), and excited (via [NII]/H_a and [SII]/H_a ratios) gas conditions,
implying the presence of a D-type ionization front propagating into the pillar
surface. Although there must be both photoevaporation outflows produced by the
ionization front, and mass-loss through mechanical ablation, we see no evidence
for any significant bulk gas motions on or around the pillar. We postulate that
the evaporated/ablated gas must be rapidly heated before being entrained.
