A Catalog of Moving Group Candidates in The Solar Neighborhood
Based on the kernel estimator and wavelet technique, we have identified 22
moving group candidates in the solar neighborhood from a sample which includes
around 14,000 dwarfs and 6000 giants. Six of them were previously known as the
Hercules stream, the Sirus-UMa stream, the Hyades stream, the Caster group, the
Pleiades stream, and the IC 2391; five of them have also been reported by other
authors. 11 moving group candidates, not previously reported in the literature,
showprominent structures in dwarf or giant samples.Acatalog of moving group
candidates in the solar neighborhood is presented in this work.
