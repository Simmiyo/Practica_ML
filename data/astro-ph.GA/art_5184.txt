The Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury. Progression of Large-Scale
  Star Formation across Space and Time in M31
We investigate the clustering of early-type stars younger than 300 Myr on
galactic scales in M31. Based on the stellar photometric catalogs of the
Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury program that also provides stellar
parameters derived from the individual energy distributions, our analysis is
focused on the young stars in three star-forming regions, located at
galactocentric distances of about 5, 10, and 15 kpc, corresponding to the inner
spiral arms, the ring structure, and the outer arm, respectively. We apply the
two-point correlation function to our selected sample to investigate the
clustering behavior of these stars across different time- and length-scales. We
find that young stellar structure survives across the whole extent of M31
longer than 300 Myr. Stellar distribution in all regions appears to be
self-similar, with younger stars being systematically more strongly clustered
than the older, which are more dispersed. The observed clustering is
interpreted as being induced by turbulence, the driving source for which is
probably gravitational instabilities driven by the spiral arms, which are
stronger closer to the galactic centre.
