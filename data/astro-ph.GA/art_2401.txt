Statistical Studies of Giant Pulse Emission from the Crab Pulsar
We have observed the Crab pulsar with the Deep Space Network (DSN) Goldstone
70 m antenna at 1664 MHz during three observing epochs for a total of 4 hours.
Our data analysis has detected more than 2500 giant pulses, with flux densities
ranging from 0.1 kJy to 150 kJy and pulse widths from 125 ns (limited by our
bandwidth) to as long as 100 microseconds, with median power amplitudes and
widths of 1 kJy and 2 microseconds respectively. The most energetic pulses in
our sample have energy fluxes of approximately 100 kJy-microsecond. We have
used this large sample to investigate a number of giant-pulse emission
properties in the Crab pulsar, including correlations among pulse flux density,
width, energy flux, phase and time of arrival. We present a consistent
accounting of the probability distributions and threshold cuts in order to
reduce pulse-width biases. The excellent sensitivity obtained has allowed us to
probe further into the population of giant pulses. We find that a significant
portion, no less than 50%, of the overall pulsed energy flux at our observing
frequency is emitted in the form of giant pulses.
