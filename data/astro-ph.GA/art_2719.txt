Uncloaking globular clusters in the inner Galaxy
Extensive photometric studies of the globular clusters located towards the
center of the Milky Way have been historically neglected. The presence of
patchy differential reddening in front of these clusters has proven to be a
significant obstacle to their detailed study. We present here a well-defined
and reasonably homogeneous photometric database for 25 of the brightest
Galactic globular clusters located in the direction of the inner Galaxy. These
data were obtained in the B, V, and I bands using the Magellan 6.5m telescope
and the Hubble Space Telescope. A new technique is extensively used in this
paper to map the differential reddening in the individual cluster fields, and
to produce cleaner, dereddened color-magnitude diagrams for all the clusters in
the database. Subsequent papers will detail the astrophysical analysis of the
cluster populations, and the properties of the obscuring material along the
clusters' lines of sight.
