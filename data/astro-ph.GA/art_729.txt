The Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey -- II. Catalog of the Image Data
We present a catalog of 8358 sources extracted from images produced by the
Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS). The BGPS is a survey of the millimeter
dust continuum emission from the northern Galactic plane. The catalog sources
are extracted using a custom algorithm, Bolocat, which was designed
specifically to identify and characterize objects in the large-area maps
generated from the Bolocam instrument. The catalog products are designed to
facilitate follow-up observations of these relatively unstudied objects. The
catalog is 98% complete from 0.4 Jy to 60 Jy over all object sizes for which
the survey is sensitive (<3.5'). We find that the sources extracted can best be
described as molecular clumps -- large dense regions in molecular clouds linked
to cluster formation. We find the flux density distribution of sources follows
a power law with dN/dS ~S^(-2.4 +/- 0.1) and that the mean Galactic latitude
for sources is significantly below the midplane: <b>=(-0.095 +/- 0.001) deg.
