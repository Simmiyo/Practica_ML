Debris discs around nearby Solar analogues
An unbiased search for debris discs around nearby Sun-like stars is reported.
Thirteen G-dwarfs at 12-15 parsecs distance were searched at 850 $\umu$m
wavelength, and a disc is confirmed around HD 30495. The estimated dust mass is
0.008 M$_{\oplus}$ with a net limit $\la 0.0025$ M$_{\oplus}$ for the average
disc of the other stars. The results suggest there is not a large missed
population of substantial cold discs around Sun-like stars -- HD 30495 is a
bright rather than unusually cool disc, and may belong to a few hundred Myr-old
population of greater dust luminosity. The far-infared and millimetre survey
data for Sun-like stars are well fitted by either steady state or stirred
models, provided that typical comet belts are comparable in size to that in the
Solar System.
