Star formation in the Cometary Globule Ori I-2
We investigate the young stellar population in and near the cometary globule
Ori,I-2. The analysis is based on deep Nordic Optical Telescope R-band and
H-alpha images, JCMT SCUBA 450 and 850 micron images combined with
near-infrared 2MASS photometry and mid-infrared archival Spitzer images
obtained with the IRAC (3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8 micron), and MIPS (24 and 70
micron) instruments. We identify a total of 125 sources within the 5'x5' region
imaged by IRAC. Of these sources 87 are detected in the R-band image and 51 are
detected in the 2MASS survey. The detailed physical properties of the sources
are explored using a combination of near/mid-infrared color-color diagrams,
greybody fitting of SEDs and an online SED fitting tool that uses a library of
2D radiation transfer based accretion models of young stellar objects with
disks. Ori I-2 shows clear evidence of triggered star formation with four young
low luminosity pre-main sequence stars embedded in the globule. At least two,
possibly as many as four, additional low-mass PMS objects, were discovered in
the field which are probably part of the young sigma-Orionis cluster. Among the
PMS stars which have formed in the globule, MIR-54 is a young, deeply embedded
Class 0/I object, MIR-51 and 52 are young Class II sources, while MIR-89 is a
more evolved, heavily extincted Class II object with its apparent colors
mimicking a Class 0/I object. The Class II source, MIR-52, which is strong a
H-alpha emission line star appears to drive an outflow approximately aligned
with the outflow from MIR-54, and because of the proximity of the two outflows,
either star could contribute. MIR-89 appears to excite a low excitation HH
object, HH 992, discovered for the first time in this study.
