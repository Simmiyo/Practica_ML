3D numerical simulations of photodissociated and photoionized disks
In this work we study the influence of the UV radiation field of a massive
star on the evolution of a disklike mass of gas and dust around a nearby star.
This system has similarities with the Orion proplyds. We study disks with
different inclinations and distances from the source, performing 3D numerical
simulations. We use the YGUAZ\'U-A adaptative grid code modified to account for
EUV/FUV fluxes and non-spherical mass distributions. We treat H and C
photoionization to reproduce the ionization fronts and photodissociation
regions observed in proplyds. We also incorporate a wind from the ionizing
source, to investigate the formation of the bow shock observed in several
proplyds. Our results show that a photoevaporated wind propagates from the disk
surface and becomes ionized after an ionization front (IF) seen as a bright
peak in Ha maps. We follow the development of an HI region inside the
photoevaporated wind which corresponds to a photodissociated region (PDR) for
most of our models, except those without a FUV flux. For disks that are at a
distance from the source d \geq 0.1 pc, the PDR is thick and the IF is detached
from the disk surface. In contrast, for disks that are closer to the source,
the PDR is thin and not resolved in our simulations. The IF then coincides with
the first grid points of the disk that are facing the ionizing photon source.
In both cases, the photoevaporated wind shocks (after the IF) with the wind
that comes from the ionizing source, and this interaction region is bright in
Ha. Our 3D models produce two emission features: a hemispherically shaped
structure (associated with the IF) and a detached bow shock where both winds
collide. A photodissociated region develops in all of the models exposed to the
FUV flux. More importantly, disks with different inclinations with respect to
the ionizating source have relatively similar photodissociation regions.
