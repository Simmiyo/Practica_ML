Variable stars, distance scale, globular clusters
Current state of the variable stars studies, including halo and
globular-cluster variables is briefly discussed, as well as the halo kinematics
and modern problems of the Universal distance scale. I propose new approach to
the projection factor (PF) calculation which takes into account its variation
with limb darkening, photosphere velocity and the intrinsic line width of the
spectrograph used for radial velocity measurements. Simple analytic
approximation for PF is given, useful for estimates of the pulsating variables
radii via Baade-Wesselink-Balona technique.
