Observability of pulsar beam bending by the Sgr~A* black hole
According to some models, there may be a significant population of radio
pulsars in the Galactic center. In principle, a beam from one of these pulsars
could pass close to the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center, be
deflected, and be detected by Earth telescopes. Such a configuration would be
an unprecedented probe of the properties of spacetime in the moderate- to
strong-field regime of the SMBH. We present here background on the problem, and
approximations for the probability of detection of such beams. We conclude that
detection is marginally probable with current telescopes, but that telescopes
that will be operating in the near future, with an appropriate multiyear
observational program, will have a good chance of detecting a beam deflected by
the SMBH.
