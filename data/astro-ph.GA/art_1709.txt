The global dust SED: Tracing the nature and evolution of dust with
  DustEM
The Planck and Herschel missions are currently measuring the farIR-mm
emission of dust, which combined with existing IR data, will for the first time
provide the full SED of the galactic ISM dust emission with an unprecedented
sensitivity and angular resolution. It will allow a systematic study of the
dust evolution processes that affect the SED. Here we present a versatile
numerical tool, DustEM, that predicts the emission and extinction of dust given
their size distribution and their optical and thermal properties. In order to
model dust evolution, DustEM has been designed to deal with a variety of grain
types, structures and size distributions and to be able to easily include new
dust physics. We use DustEM to model the dust SED and extinction in the diffuse
interstellar medium at high-galactic latitude (DHGL), a natural reference SED.
We present a coherent set of observations for the DHGL SED. The dust components
in our DHGL model are (i) PAHs, (ii) amorphous carbon and (iii) amorphous
silicates. We use amorphous carbon dust, rather than graphite, because it
better explains the observed high abundances of gas-phase carbon in shocked
regions of the interstellar medium. Using the DustEM model, we illustrate how,
in the optically thin limit, the IRAS/Planck HFI (and likewise Spitzer/Herschel
for smaller spatial scales) photometric band ratios of the dust SED can
disentangle the influence of the exciting radiation field intensity and
constrain the abundance of small grains relative to the larger grains. We also
discuss the contributions of the different grain populations to the IRAS,
Planck and Herschel channels. Such information is required to enable a study of
the evolution of dust as well as to systematically extract the dust thermal
emission from CMB data and to analyze the emission in the Planck polarized
channels. The DustEM code described in this paper is publically available.
