Wind-Swept Clouds and Possible Triggered Star-Formation associated with
  the Supernova Remnant G357.7+0.3
We present evidence for interaction between the supernova remnant (SNR)
G357.7+0.3 and nearby molecular clouds, leading to the formation of wind-swept
structures and bright emission rims. These features are not observed at visual
wavelengths, but are clearly visible in mid-infrared (MIR) mapping undertaken
using the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST). Analysis of one of these clouds, the
bright cometary structure G357.46+0.60, suggests that it contains strong
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features in the 5.8 and 8.0
microns photometric bands, and that these are highly variable over relatively
small spatial scales. This source also appears to contain a YSO within the
bright rim structure, with a steeply rising spectrum between 1.25 and 24
microns.
  Finally, it is noted that a further, conical emission region appears to be
associated with the Mira V1139 Sco, and it is suggested that this may represent
the case of a Mira outflow interacting with a SNR.
