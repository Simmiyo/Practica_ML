Stellar kinematics in blue compact galaxies
In a programme of observations of local luminous blue compact galaxies
(BCGs), we are investigating kinematics by using tracers of both stars and
ionized gas. Here we summarise our program and present new data on the local
Lyman break galaxy analogue Haro 11. From spatially-resolved spectroscopy
around the near-infrared Ca II triplet, we find that its stars and ionized gas
have similar velocity fields. Our programme so far indicates however that
emission line velocities can differ locally by a few tens of km/s from the Ca
II values. Comparing our data to simple stellar population models, we assess
which stellar population the Ca II triplet traces and its potential beyond the
local universe.
