UKIRT follow-up observations of the old open cluster FSR0358
  (Kirkpatrick1)
We aim to characterise the properties of the stellar clusters in the Milky
Way. Utilising an expectation-maximisation method we determined that the
cluster FSR0358, originally discovered by J.D.Kirkpatrick, is the most likely
real cluster amongst the cluster candidates from Froebrich et al.. Here we
present new deep high resolution near infrared imaging of this object obtained
with UKIRT. The analysis of the data reveals that FSR0358 (Kirkpatrick1) is a
5+-2Gyr old open cluster in the outer Milky Way. Its age, metallicity of
Z=0.008 and distance from the Galactic Centre of 11.2kpc are typical for the
known old open galactic clusters. So far six of the FSR cluster candidates have
been identified as having an age above 5Gyr. This shows the significance of
this catalogue in enhancing our knowledge of the oldest open clusters in the
Galaxy.
