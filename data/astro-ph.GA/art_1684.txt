A Catalog of CH_3OH 7_0-6_1 A^+ Maser Sources in Massive Star-Forming
  Regions. II. Masers in NGC 6334F, G8.67-0.36, and M17
We present Very Large Array observations of the 7_0-6_1 A^+ methanol maser
transition at 44 GHz towards NGC 6334F, G8.67-0.36, and M17. These arcsecond
resolution observations complete a previous, larger VLA survey of this maser
transition in high-mass star-forming regions reported by Kurtz et al. We
confirm the presence of 44 GHz methanol maser emission in all three sources,
detecting eight distinct maser components in NGC 6334F, twelve components in
G8.67-0.36 and one in M17.
