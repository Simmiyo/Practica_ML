A preliminary distance to W 75N in the Cygnus X star-forming region
Cygnus X is one of the closest giant molecular cloud complexes and therefore
an extensively studied region of ongoing high mass star formation. However, the
distance to this region has been a long-standing issue, since sources at
galactic longitude of ~80 degrees could be in the Local Arm nearby (1-2 kpc),
in the Perseus Arm at ~5 kpc, or even in the outer arm (~10 kpc). We use
combined observations of the EVN plus two Japanese stations to measure very
accurate parallaxes of methanol masers in five star-forming regions in Cygnus X
to understand if they belong to one large star-forming complex or if they are
separate entities located at different distances. Here we report our
preliminary result for W75N based on six epochs of VLBI observations: we find
that W75N is at a distance of 1.32^{+0.11}_{-0.09} kpc, which is significantly
closer than the reported values in the literature (1.5-2 kpc).
