Abundance structure and chemical evolution of the Galactic disc
We have obtained high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra for 899 F and
G dwarf stars in the Solar neighbourhood. The stars were selected on the basis
of their kinematic properties to trace the thin and thick discs, the Hercules
stream, and the metal-rich stellar halo. A significant number of stars with
kinematic properties 'in between' the thin and thick discs were also observed
in order to in greater detail investigate the dichotomy of the Galactic disc.
All stars have been homogeneously analysed, using the exact same methods,
atomic data, model atmospheres, etc., and also truly differentially to the Sun.
Hence, the sample is likely to be free from internal errors, allowing us to, in
a multi-dimensional space consisting of detailed elemental abundances, stellar
ages, and the full three-dimensional space velocities, reveal very small
differences between the stellar populations.
