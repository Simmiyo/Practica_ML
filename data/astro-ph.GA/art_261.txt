Observable consequences of kinetic and thermal AGN feedback in
  elliptical galaxies and galaxy clusters
We have constructed an analytical model of AGN feedback and studied its
implications for elliptical galaxies and galaxy clusters. The results show that
momentum injection above a critical value will eject material from low mass
elliptical galaxies, and leads to an X-ray luminosity, $L_{\rm X}$, that is
$\propto$ $\sigma^{8-10}$, depending on the AGN fuelling mechanism, where
$\sigma$ is the velocity dispersion of the hot gas. This result agrees well
with both observations and semi-analytic models. In more massive ellipticals
and clusters, AGN outflows quickly become buoyancy-dominated. This necessarily
means that heating by a central cluster AGN redistributes the intracluster
medium (ICM) such that the mass of hot gas, within the cooling radius, should
be $ \propto L_{\rm X}(<r_{\rm cool})/[g(r_{\rm cool})\sigma]$, where $g(r_{\rm
cool})$ is the gravitational acceleration at the cooling radius. This
prediction is confirmed using observations of seven clusters. The same
mechanism also defines a critical ICM cooling time of $\sim 0.5$ Gyr, which is
in reasonable agreement with recent observations showing that star formation
and AGN activity are triggered below a universal cooling time threshold.
