HAT Discovery of 76 Bright Periodic Variables Toward the Galactic Bulge
We report on photometric I-band observations of 147 bright (8<I<13) periodic
variables toward the Galactic bulge including 76 new discoveries. We used one
of the HATnet telescopes to obtain 151 exposures spanning 88 nights in 2005 of
an 8.4 x 8.4 deg^2 field of view (FOV) approximately centered on (l,b) = (1.73,
-4.68). We observed the galactic bulge in 2005 as part of a microlensing
feasibility study (Nataf et al. 2009), and here we discuss the periodic
variables we found in our data. Among our discoveries we count 52 new eclipsing
binaries and 24 other periodic variables.
