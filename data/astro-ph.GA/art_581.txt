The colour of the narrow line Sy1-blazar 0324+3410
Aims. We investigate the properties of the host galaxy of the blazar
J0324+3410 (B2 0321+33) by the analysis of B and R images obtained with the NOT
under good photometric conditions. Methods: The galaxy was studied using
different methods: Sersic model fitting, unsharp-masked images, B-R image and
B-R profile analysis. Results: The images show that the host galaxy has a
ring-like morphology. The B-R colour image reveals two bluish zones: one that
coincides with the nuclear region, interpreted as the signature of emission
related to the active nucleus, the other zone is extended and is located in the
host ring-structure. We discuss the hypothesis that the later is thermal
emission from a burst of star formation triggered by an interacting/merging
process.
