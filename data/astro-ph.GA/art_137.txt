The Ejecta Distributions of the Heavy Elements in the Cygnus Loop
We analyzed the metal distribution of the Cygnus Loop using 14 and 7
pointings observation data obtained by the \textit{Suzaku} and the
\textit{XMM-Newton} observatories. The spectral analysis shows that all the
spectra are well fitted by the two-$kT_e$ non-equilibrium ionization plasma
model as shown by the earlier observations. From the best-fit parameters of the
high-$kT_e$ component, we calculated the emission measures about various
elements and showed the metal distribution of the ejecta component. We found
that the distributions of Si and Fe are centered at the southwest of the
geometric center toward the blow-out region. From the best-fit parameters, we
also estimated the progenitor mass of the Cygnus Loop from our field of view
and the metal rich region with a radius of 25 arcmin from the metal center. The
result from the metal circle is similar to that from our entire FOV, which
suggests the mixing of the metal. From the results, we estimated the mass of
the progenitor star at 12-15\MO.
