The Rising Stellar Velocity Dispersion of M87 from Integrated Starlight
We have measured the line-of-sight velocity distribution from integrated
stellar light at two points in the outer halo of M87 (NGC 4486), the
second-rank galaxy in the Virgo Cluster. The data were taken at R = 480" ($\sim
41.5$ kpc) and R = 526" ($\sim 45.5$ kpc) along the SE major axis. The second
moment for a non-parametric estimate of the full velocity distribution is $420
\pm 23$ km/s and $577 \pm 35$ km/s respectively. There is intriguing evidence
in the velocity profiles for two kinematically distinct stellar components at
the position of our pointing. Under this assumption we employ a two-Gaussian
decomposition and find the primary Gaussian having rest velocities equal to M87
(consistent with zero rotation) and second moments of $383 \pm 32$ km/s and
$446 \pm 43$ km/s respectively. The asymmetry seen in the velocity profiles
suggests that the stellar halo of M87 is not in a relaxed state and confuses a
clean dynamical interpretation. That said, either measurement (full or two
component model) shows a rising velocity dispersion at large radii, consistent
with previous integrated light measurements, yet significantly higher than
globular cluster measurements at comparable radial positions. These integrated
light measurements at large radii, and the stark contrast they make to the
measurements of other kinematic tracers, highlight the rich kinematic
complexity of environments like the center of the Virgo Cluster and the need
for caution when interpreting kinematic measurements from various dynamical
tracers.
