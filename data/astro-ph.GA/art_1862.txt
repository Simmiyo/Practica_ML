Schwarzschild geodesics in terms of elliptic functions and the related
  red shift
Using Weierstrassian elliptic functions the exact geodesics in the
Schwarzschild metric are expressed in a simple and most transparent form. The
results are useful for analytical and numerical applications. For example we
calculate the perihelion precession and the light deflection in the
post-Einsteinian approximation. The bounded orbits are computed in the
post-Newtonian order. As a topical application we calculate the gravitational
red shift for a star moving in the Schwarzschild field.
