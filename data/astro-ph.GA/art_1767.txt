The Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey IV: 1.1 and 0.35 mm Dust Continuum
  Emission in the Galactic Center Region
The Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS) data for a six square degree region
of the Galactic plane containing the Galactic center is analyzed and compared
to infrared and radio continuum data. The BGPS 1.1 mm emission consists of
clumps interconnected by a network of fainter filaments surrounding cavities, a
few of which are filled with diffuse near-IR emission indicating the presence
of warm dust or with radio continuum characteristic of HII regions or supernova
remnants. New 350 {\mu}m images of the environments of the two brightest
regions, Sgr A and B, are presented. Sgr B2 is the brightest mm-emitting clump
in the Central Molecular Zone and may be forming the closest analog to a super
star cluster in the Galaxy. The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) contains the
highest concentration of mm and sub-mm emitting dense clumps in the Galaxy.
Most 1.1 mm features at positive longitudes are seen in silhouette against the
3.6 to 24 {\mu}m background observed by the Spitzer Space Telescope. However,
only a few clumps at negative longitudes are seen in absorption, confirming the
hypothesis that positive longitude clumps in the CMZ tend to be on the
near-side of the Galactic center, consistent with the suspected orientation of
the central bar in our Galaxy. Some 1.1 mm cloud surfaces are seen in emission
at 8 {\mu}m, presumably due to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). A
~0.2\degree (~30 pc) diameter cavity and infrared bubble between l \approx
0.0\degree and 0.2\degree surrounds the Arches and Quintuplet clusters and Sgr
A. The bubble contains several clumpy dust filaments that point toward Sgr
A\ast; its potential role in their formation is explored. [abstract truncated]
