DEFPOS H$α$ Observations of W80 Complex
We present H${\alpha}$ emission line measurements of the W80 nebular complex.
A total of 26 regions have been observed inside the nebula with the Dual Etalon
Fabry-Perot Optical Spectrometer (DEFPOS) system at the f/48 Coude focus of 150
cm RTT150 telescope located at TUBITAK National Observatory (TUG) in
Antalya/Turkey. The intensities, the local standard of rest (LSR) velocities
($V_{LSR}$), heliocentric radial velocities ($V_{HEL}$) and the linewidths at
Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the H${\alpha}$ emission lines have been
determined from these observations. They lie in the range of 259 to 1159
Rayleigh {1R = 10$^{6}/4\pi$ photons cm$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ =
2.4110$^{-7}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ at H${\alpha}$.} (R), 4 to 12 km
s$^{-1}$ and 44 to 55 km s$^{-1}$, respectively. The radial velocity
measurements show that there are several maxima and minima inside the W80. The
new results confirm the literature that complex seems to be rather a uniform in
radial velocity and no seen turbulent motion inside the complex. The average
value of the calculated the Emission Measure (EM) for the regions is 3.1 pc
cm$^{-6}$.
