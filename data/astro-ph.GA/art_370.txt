Periodical component found in the space maser signal and its
  interpretation
The periodical component predicted by the theory of optic-metrical parametric
resonance was recently found in the signal of Sep A radio source. If such
observations performed independently give similar results, they would provide
another evidence of the gravitational waves (GW) existence and the perspectives
of the GW astronomy could be discussed.
