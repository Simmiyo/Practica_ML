A law of motion for spherical shells in special relativity
Self-similar solutions to the problem of a special relativistic law of motion
for thin shells of matter are calculated. These solutions represent the special
relativistic generalization of momentum conservation for the thin layer
approximation in classical physics. The analytical and numerical results are
applied to Supernova Remnant 1987 A.
