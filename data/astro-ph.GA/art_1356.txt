Galactic Spiral Shocks with Thermal Instability in Vertically Stratified
  Galactic Disks
Galactic spiral shocks are dominant morphological features and believed to be
responsible for substructure formation within spiral arms in disk galaxies.
They can also contribute a substantial amount of kinetic energy to the
interstellar gas by tapping the (differential) rotational motion. We use
numerical hydrodynamic simulations to investigate dynamics and structure of
spiral shocks with thermal instability in vertically stratified galactic disks,
focusing on environmental conditions (of heating and the galactic potential)
similar to the Solar neighborhood. We initially consider an isothermal disk in
vertical hydrostatic equilibrium and let it evolve subject to interstellar
cooling and heating as well as a stellar spiral potential. Due to thermal
instability, a disk with surface density $\Sigma_0 \geq 6.7\Surf$ rapidly turns
to a thin dense slab near the midplane sandwiched between layers of rarefied
gas. The imposed spiral potential leads to a vertically curved shock that
exhibits strong flapping motions in the plane perpendicular to the arm. The
overall flow structure at saturation is comprised of arm, postshock expansion
zone, and interarm regions that occupy typically 10\%, 20\%, and 70\% of the
arm-to-arm distance, in which the gas resides for 15\%, 30\%, and 55\% of the
arm-to-arm crossing time, respectively. The flows are characterized by
transitions from rarefied to dense phases at the shock and from dense to
rarefied phases in the postshock expansion zone, although gas with too-large
postshock-density does not undergo this return phase transition, instead
forming dense condensations. If self-gravity is omitted, the shock flapping
drives random motions in the gas, but only up to $\sim 2-3 \kms$ in the
in-plane direction and less than $2\kms$ in the vertical direction.
