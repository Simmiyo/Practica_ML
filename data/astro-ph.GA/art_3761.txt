Systematic variations of interstellar linear polarization and growth of
  dust grains
A quantitative interpretation of the observed relation between the
interstellar linear polarization curve parameters $K$ and $\lambda_{\max}$
characterizing the width and the wavelength of a polarization maximum,
respectively, is given. The observational data available for 57 stars located
in the dark clouds in Taurus, Chamaeleon, around the stars $\rho$ Oph and R CrA
are considered. The spheroidal particle model of interstellar dust grains
earlier applied to simultaneously interpret the interstellar extinction and
polarization curves in a wide spectral range is utilized. The observed trend $K
\approx 1.7 \lambda_{\max}$ is shown to be most likely related to a growth of
dust grains due to coagulation rather than mantle accretion. The relation of
the parameters $K$ and $\lambda_{\max}$ with an average size of silicate dust
grains is discussed.
