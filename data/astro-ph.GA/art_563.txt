Pfleiderer2: identification of a new globular cluster in the Galaxy
We provide evidence that indicate the star cluster Pfleiderer 2, which is
projected in a rich field, as a newly identified Galactic globular cluster.
Since it is located in a crowded field, core extraction and decontamination
tools were applied to reveal the cluster sequences in B, V and I
Color-Magnitude Diagrams (CMDs). The main CMD features of Pfleiderer 2 are a
tilted Red Giant Branch, and a red Horizontal Branch, indicating a high
metallicity around solar. The reddening is E(B-V)=1.01. The globular cluster is
located at a distance from the Sun d$_{\odot}$ = 16$\pm$2 kpc.
  The cluster is located at 2.7 kpc above the Galactic plane and at a distance
from the Galactic center of R$_{\rm GC}$=9.7 kpc, which is unusual for a
metal-rich globular cluster.
