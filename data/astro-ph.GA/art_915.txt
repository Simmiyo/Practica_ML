CCD BV and 2MASS photometric study of the open cluster NGC 1513
We present CCD BV and JHK$_{s}$ 2MASS photometric data for the open cluster
NGC 1513. We observed 609 stars in the direction of the cluster up to a
limiting magnitude of $V\sim19$ mag. The star count method shows that the
centre of the cluster lies at $\alpha_{2000}=04^{h}09^{m}36^{s}$,
$\delta_{2000}=49^{\circ}28^{'}43^{''}$ and its angular size is $r=10$ arcmin.
The optical and near-infrared two-colour diagrams reveal the colour excesses in
the direction of the cluster as $E(B-V)=0.68\pm0.06$, $E(J-H)=0.21\pm0.02$ and
$E(J-K_{s})=0.33\pm0.04$ mag. These results are consistent with normal
interstellar extinction values. Optical and near-infrared Zero Age
Main-Sequences (ZAMS) provided an average distance modulus of
$(m-M)_{0}=10.80\pm0.13$ mag, which can be translated into a distance of
$1440\pm80$ pc. Finally, using Padova isochrones we determined the metallicity
and age of the cluster as $Z=0.015\pm 0.004$ ($[M/H]=-0.10 \pm 0.10$ dex) and
$\log (t/yr) = 8.40\pm0.04$, respectively.
