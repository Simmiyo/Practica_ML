Acceleration and ejection of ring vortexes by a convergent flow as a
  probable mechanism of arising jet components of AGN
Exact solutions of two-dimensional hydrodynamics equations for the symmetric
configurations of two and four vortices in the presence of an arbitrary flow
with a singular point are found. The solutions describe the dynamics of the
dipole toroidal vortex in accretion and wind flows in active galactic nuclei.
It is shown that the toroidal vortices in a converging (accretion) flow, being
compressed along the large radius, are ejected with acceleration along the axis
of symmetry of the nucleus, forming the components of two-sided jet. The
increment of velocities of the vortices is determined by the monopole component
of the flow only. The dipole component of the flow determines the asymmetry of
ejections in the case of an asymmetric flow.
