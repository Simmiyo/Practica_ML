C IV Emission-line Detection of the Supernova Remnant RCW 114
We report the detection of the C IV 1548, 1551 emission line in the region of
the RCW 114 nebula using the FIMS/SPEAR data. The observed C IV line intensity
indicates that RCW 114 is much closer to us than WR 90, a Wolf-Rayet star that
was thought to be associated with RCW 114 in some of the previous studies. We
also found the existence of a small H I bubble centered on WR 90, with a
different local standard of rest velocity range from that of the large H I
bubble which was identified previously as related to RCW 114. These findings
imply that the RCW 114 nebula is an old supernova remnant which is not
associated with WR 90. Additionally, the global morphologies of the C IV,
H-alpha, and H I emissions show that RCW 114 has evolved in a non-uniform
interstellar medium.
