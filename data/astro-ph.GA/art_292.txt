Estimating black hole masses in young radio sources using CFHT
  spectroscopy
The correlation between black hole masses and stellar velocity dispersions
provides an efficient method to determine the masses of black holes in active
galaxies. We obtained optical spectra of a Compact-Steep-Spectrum (CSS) galaxy
4C +29.70, using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) equipped with OSIS,
in August 6, 2003. Several stellar absorption features, such as Mg I (5175\AA),
Ca E band (5269\AA) and Na D (5890\AA), were detected in the spectra. The
stellar velocity dispersion, $\sigma$, of the host galaxy, measured from
absorption features is $\rm \approx 250 km s^{-1}$. If 4C +29.70 follows the
$\rm M_{BH}-\sigma$ relation established for nearby galaxies, then its central
black hole has a mass of $\rm \approx3.3\times10^{8}M_{\odot}$. In combination
with the black hole masses of seven GPS galaxies in Snellen et al. (2003), we
find that the average black hole mass of these eight young radio sources is
smaller than that of the Bettoni et al. (2003) sample of extended radio
galaxies. This may indicate that young radio sources are likely at the early
evolutionary stage of radio galaxies, at which the central black holes may
still undergo rapid growth. However, this needs further investigations.
