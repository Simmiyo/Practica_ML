The Quest for the Sun's Siblings: an Exploratory Search in the Hipparcos
  Catalogue
We describe the results of a search for the remnants of the Sun's birth
cluster among stars in the Hipparcos Catalogue. This search is based on the
predicted phase space distribution of the Sun's siblings from simple
simulations of the orbits of the cluster stars in a smooth Galactic potential.
For stars within 100 pc the simulations show that it is interesting to examine
those that have small space motions relative to the Sun. From amongst the
candidate siblings thus selected there are six stars with ages consistent with
that of the Sun. Considering their radial velocities and abundances only one
potential candidate, HIP 21158, remains but essentially the result of the
search is negative. This is consistent with predictions by Portegies Zwart
(2009) on the number of siblings near the Sun. We discuss the steps that should
be taken in anticipation of the data from the Gaia mission in order to conduct
fruitful searches for the Sun's siblings in the future.
