Particle Dark Matter and DAMA/LIBRA
The DAMA/LIBRA set-up (about 250 kg highly radiopure NaI(Tl) sensitive mass)
is running at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory of the I.N.F.N.. The first
DAMA/LIBRA results confirm the evidence for the presence of a Dark Matter
particle component in the galactic halo, as pointed out by the former DAMA/NaI
set-up; cumulatively the data support such evidence at 8.2 sigma C.L. and
satisfy all the many peculiarities of the Dark Matter annual modulation
signature. The main aspects and prospects of this model independent
experimental approach will be outlined.
