High-Mass Star Formation in the Near and Far 3-KPC Arms
We report on the presence of 6.7-GHz methanol masers, known tracers of
high-mass star formation, in the 3-kpc arms of the inner Galaxy. We present 49
detections from the Methanol Multibeam Survey, the largest Galactic plane
survey for 6.7-GHz methanol masers, which coincide in longitude, latitude and
velocity with the recently discovered far-side 3-kpc arm and the well known
near-side 3-kpc arm. The presence of these masers is significant evidence for
high-mass star formation actively occurring in both 3-kpc arms.
