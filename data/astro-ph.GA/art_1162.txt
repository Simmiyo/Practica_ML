The complex structure of HH 110 as revealed from Integral Field
  Spectroscopy
HH 110 is a rather peculiar Herbig-Haro object in Orion that originates due
to the deflection of another jet (HH 270) by a dense molecular clump, instead
of being directly ejected from a young stellar object. Here we present new
results on the kinematics and physical conditions of HH 110 based on Integral
Field Spectroscopy. The 3D spectral data cover the whole outflow extent (~4.5
arcmin, ~0.6 pc at a distance of 460 pc) in the spectral range 6500-7000 \AA.
We built emission-line intensity maps of H$\alpha$, [NII] and [SII] and of
their radial velocity channels. Furthermore, we analysed the spatial
distribution of the excitation and electron density from [NII]/H$\alpha$,
[SII]/H$\alpha$, and [SII] 6716/6731 integrated line-ratio maps, as well as
their behaviour as a function of velocity, from line-ratio channel maps. Our
results fully reproduce the morphology and kinematics obtained from previous
imaging and long-slit data. In addition, the IFS data revealed, for the first
time, the complex spatial distribution of the physical conditions (excitation
and density) in the whole jet, and their behaviour as a function of the
kinematics. The results here derived give further support to the more recent
model simulations that involve deflection of a pulsed jet propagating in an
inhomogeneous ambient medium. The IFS data give richer information than that
provided by current model simulations or laboratory jet experiments. Hence,
they could provide valuable clues to constrain the space parameters in future
theoretical works.
