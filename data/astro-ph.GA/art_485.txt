Discovery of three new pulsars in a 610 MHz pulsar survey with the GMRT
We report on the discovery of three new pulsars in the first blind survey of
the north Galactic plane (45 degrees < l < 135 degrees; |b| < 1 degrees with
the Giant Meterwave Radio telescope (GMRT) at an intermediate frequency of 610
MHz. The survey covered 106 square degrees with a sensitivity of roughly 1 mJy
to long-period pulsars (pulsars with period longer than 1 s). The three new
pulsars have periods of 318, 933, and 1056 ms. Their timing parameters and flux
densities, obtained in follow up observations with the Lovell Telescope at
Jodrell Bank and the GMRT, are presented. We also report on pulse nulling
behaviour in one of the newly discovered pulsars, PSR J2208+5500.
