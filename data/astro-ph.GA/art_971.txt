Galactic tide
Equation of motion for the galactic tide is derived under the assumption of
cylindrically symmetric gravitational potential of the Galaxy. The paper
considers galactic tide both for the galactic plane $x-$ and $y-$ components
and also for the normal $z-$ component. The $x-$ and $y-$ components of the
acceleration come not only from the $x-$ and $y-$ components of the position of
a body, but also from its $z-$component of the position vector.
  Values of the Oort constants are $A$ $=$ (14.2 $\pm$ 0.5) $km s^{-1}
kpc^{-1}$ and $B$ $=$ ($-$ 12.4 $\pm$ 0.5) $km s^{-1} kpc^{-1}$. %(the values
hold for the galactocentric distance of the Sun). Mass density in the solar
neighborhood, 30 $pc$ above the galactic equatorial plane, equals to (0.117
$\pm$ 0.005) $M_{\odot} pc^{-3}$. The result for the acceleration is written in
the form easily applicable to Solar System studies, to the evolution of comets
in the Oort cloud.
