Non-exponential hydrodynamical growth in density-stratified thin
  Keplerian discs
The short time evolution of three dimensional small perturbations is studied.
Exhibiting spectral asymptotic stability, thin discs are nonetheless shown to
host intensive hydrodynamical activity in the shape of non modal growth of
initial small perturbations. Two mechanisms that lead to such behavior are
identified and studied, namely, non-resonant excitation of vertically confined
sound waves by stable planar inertia-coriolis modes that results in linear
growth with time, as well as resonant coupling of those two modes that leads to
a quadratic growth of the initial perturbations. It is further speculated that
the non modal growth can give rise to secondary strato-rotational instabilities
and thus lead to a new route to turbulence generation in thin discs.
