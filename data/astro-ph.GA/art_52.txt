IR Dust Bubbles II: Probing the Detailed Structure and Young Massive
  Stellar Populations of Galactic HII Regions
We present an analysis of late-O/early-B-powered, parsec-sized bubbles and
associated star-formation using 2MASS, GLIMPSE, MIPSGAL and MAGPIS surveys.
Three bubbles were selected from the Churchwell et al. (2007) catalog. We
confirm that the structure identified in Watson et al. (2008) holds in less
energetic bubbles, i.e. a PDR, identified by 8 um emission due to PAHs
surrounds hot dust, identified by 24 um emission and ionized gas, identified by
20 cm continuum. We estimate the dynamical age of two bubbles by comparing
bubble sizes to numerical models of Hosokawa & Inutsuka (2006). We also
identify and analyze candidate young stellar objects (YSOs) using SED fitting
and identify sites of possible triggered star-formation. Lastly, we identify
likely ionizing sources for two sources based on SED fitting.
