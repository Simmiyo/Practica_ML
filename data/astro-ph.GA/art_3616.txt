The Supershell-Molecular Cloud Connection: Large-Scale Stellar Feedback
  and the Formation of the Molecular ISM
The accumulation, compression and cooling of the ambient interstellar medium
(ISM) in large-scale flows powered by OB cluster feedback can drive the
production of dense molecular clouds. We review the current state of the field,
with a strong focus on the explicit modelling and observation of the neutral
interstellar medium. Magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of colliding ISM flows
provide a strong theoretical framework in which to view feedback-driven cloud
formation, as do models of the gravitational fragmentation of expanding shells.
Rapid theoretical developments are accompanied by growing body of observational
work that provides good evidence for the formation of molecular gas via stellar
feedback - both in the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud. The importance
of stellar feedback compared to other major astrophysical drivers of dense gas
formation remains to be investigated further, and will be an important target
for future work.
