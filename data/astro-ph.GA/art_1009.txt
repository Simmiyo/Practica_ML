The extreme luminosity states of Sagittarius A*
We discuss mm-wavelength radio, 2.2-11.8um NIR and 2-10 keV X-ray light
curves of the super massive black hole (SMBH) counterpart of Sagittarius A*
(SgrA*) near its lowest and highest observed luminosity states. The luminosity
during the low state can be interpreted as synchrotron emission from a
continuous or even spotted accretion disk. For the high luminosity state SSC
emission from THz peaked source components can fully account for the flux
density variations observed in the NIR and X-ray domain. We conclude that at
near-infrared wavelengths the SSC mechanism is responsible for all emission
from the lowest to the brightest flare from SgrA*. For the bright flare event
of 4 April 2007 that was covered from the radio to the X-ray domain, the SSC
model combined with adiabatic expansion can explain the related peak
luminosities and different widths of the flare profiles obtained in the NIR and
X-ray regime as well as the non detection in the radio domain.
