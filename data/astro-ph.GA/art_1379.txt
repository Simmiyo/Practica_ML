On the radial distribution of stars of different stellar generations in
  the globular cluster NGC 3201
We study the radial distribution of stars of different stellar generations in
the globular cluster NGC 3201. From recently published multicolour photometry,
a radial dependence of the location of stars on the giant branch was found. We
coupled the photometric information to our sample of 100 red giants with Na, O
abundances and known classification as first or second-generation stars. We
find that giants stars of the second generation in NGC 3201 show a tendency to
be more centrally concentrated than stars of the first generation, supporting
less robust results from our spectroscopic analysis.
