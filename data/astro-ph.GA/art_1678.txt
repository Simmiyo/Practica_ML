Discovery of two Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars in Circinus
I report the discovery of two new Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars in Circinus via
detection of their C, N and He Near-Infrared emission lines, using ESO-NTT-SOFI
archival data. The H- and K-band spectra of WR67a and WR67b, indicate that they
are Wolf-Rayet stars of WN6h and WC8 sub-types, respectively. WR67a presents a
weak-lined spectrum probably reminiscent of young hydrogen rich main-sequence
stars such as WR25 in Car OB1 and HD97950 in NGC3603. Indeed, this conclusion
is reinforced by the close morphological match of the WR67a H- and K-band
spectra with that for WR21a, a known extremely massive binary system. WR67b is
probably a non-dusty WC8 Wolf-Rayet star that has a estimated heliocentric
distance of 2.7(0.9) kpc, which for its Galactic coordinates, puts the star
probably in the near portion of the Scutum-Centaurus arm.
