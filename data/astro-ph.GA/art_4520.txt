Do Most Active Galactic Nuclei Live in High Star Formation Nuclear
  Cusps?
We present early results of the Herschel PACS (70 and 160 \micron{}) and
SPIRE (250, 350, and 500 \micron{}) survey of 313 low redshift ($\rm{z} <
0.05$), ultra-hard X-ray (14--195 keV) selected AGN from the 58 month Swift/BAT
catalog. Selection of AGN from ultra-hard X-rays avoids bias from obscuration
providing a complete sample of AGN to study the connection between nuclear
activity and star formation in host galaxies. With the high angular resolution
of PACS, we find that $>$35\%$ and $>$20\%$ of the sources are "point-like" at
70 and 160 \micron{} respectively and many more that have their flux dominated
by a point source located at the nucleus. The inferred star formation rates
(SFR) of 0.1 - 100 M$_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$ using the 70 and 160 \micron{} flux
densities as SFR indicators are consistent with those inferred from Spitzer
NeII fluxes, but we find that 11.25 \micron{} PAH data give $\sim$3x lower SFR.
Using GALFIT to measure the size of the FIR emitting regions, we determined the
SFR surface density [M$_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$] for our sample, finding a
significant fraction of these sources exceed the threshold for star formation
driven winds (0.1 M$_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$).
