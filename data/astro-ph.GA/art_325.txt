A new perspective on GCRT J1745-3009
Two WSRT observations were performed and five archival VLA data were reduced
in order to redetect the enigmatic radio transient GCRT J1745-3009. The source
was not redetected. We were, however, able to extract important new information
from the discovery dataset. Our reanalysis excludes models that predict
symmetric bursts, but the transient white dwarf pulsar is favoured. Although we
now have more contraints on the properties of this source, we are still unsure
about its basic model.
