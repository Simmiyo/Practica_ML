Predicted Colors and Flux Densities of Protostars in the Herschel PACS
  and SPIRE Filters
Upcoming surveys with the Herschel Space Observatory will yield far-IR
photometry of large samples of young stellar objects, which will require
careful interpretation. We investigate the color and luminosity diagnostics
based on Herschel broad-band filters to identify and discern the properties of
low-mass protostars. We compute a grid of 2,016 protostars in various physical
congurations, present the expected flux densities and flux density ratios for
this grid of protostars, and compare Herschel observations of three protostars
to the model results. These provide useful constraints on the range of colors
and fluxes of protostar in the Herschel filters. We find that Herschel data
alone is likely a useful diagnostic of the envelope properties of young stars
