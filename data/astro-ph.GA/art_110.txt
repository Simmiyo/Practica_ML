Evidence for an InterMediate Line Region in AGN's Inner Torus Region and
  Its Evolution from Narrow to Broad Line Seyfert I Galaxies
We have decomposed the broad H-alpha, H-beta and H-gamma lines of 90 Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) into a superposition of a very broad and an intermediate
Gaussian components (VBGC and IMGC) and discovered that the two Gaussian
components evolve with FWHM of the whole emission lines. We suggest that the
VBGC and the IMGC are produced in different emission regions, namely, Very
Broad Line Region (VBLR) and Intermediate Line Region (IMLR). The details of
the two components of H-alpha, H-beta and H-gamma lines indicate that the
radius obtained from the emission line reverberation mapping normally
corresponds to the radius of the VBLR, but the radius obtained from the
infrared reverberation mapping corresponding to IMLR, i.e., the inner boundary
of the dusty torus. The existence of the IMGC may affect the measurement of the
black hole mass in AGNs. Therefore, the deviation of NLS1s from the M-sigma
relation may be explained naturally in this way. The evolution of the two
emission line regions may be related to the evolutionary stages of the broad
line regions of AGNs from NLS1s to BLS1s. Other evidences for the existence of
the IMLR are also presented.
