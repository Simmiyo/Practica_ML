Diffuse UV Background: GALEX Results
A bright UV GALEX image in the direction of a dense high galactic latitude
interstellar dust cloud is examined to test (and to reject) the idea that a
bright extragalactic UV background radiation field exists. A GALEX "Deep
Imaging Survey" image of a second high latitude region (a region almost totally
free of dust) shows a similar bright background, which, clearly, cannot be due
to starlight scattered from interstellar dust. I speculate that the background
is due to dark matter particles interacting with interstellar gas/dust
nucleons.
