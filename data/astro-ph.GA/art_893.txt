Characterizing Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence in the Small Magellanic
  Cloud
We investigate the nature and spatial variations of turbulence in the Small
Magellanic Cloud (SMC) by applying several statistical methods on the neutral
hydrogen (HI) column density image of the SMC and a database of isothermal
numerical simulations. By using the 3rd and 4th statistical moments we derive
the spatial distribution of the sonic Mach number (M_s) across the SMC. We find
that about 90% of the HI in the SMC is subsonic or transonic. However, edges of
the SMC `bar' have M_s=4 and may be tracing shearing or turbulent flows. Using
numerical simulations we also investigate how the slope of the spatial power
spectrum depends on both sonic and Alfven Mach numbers. This allows us to gauge
the Alfven Mach number of the SMC and conclude that its gas pressure dominates
over the magnetic pressure. The super-Alfvenic nature of the HI gas in the SMC
is also highlighted by the bispectrum, a three-point correlation function which
characterizes the level of non-Gaussianity in wave modes. We find that the
bispectrum of the SMC HI column density displays similar large-scale
correlations as numerical simulations, however it has localized enhancements of
correlations. In addition, we find a break in correlations at a scale of 160
pc. This may be caused by numerous expanding shells of a similar size.
