Infrared extinction in the Inner Milky Way through the red clump giants
While the shape of the extinction curve on the infrared is considered to be
set and the extinction ratios between infrared bands are usually taken to be
approximately constant, a recent number of studies point either to a spatially
variable behavior on the exponent of the power law or to a different extinction
law altogether. In this paper, we propose a method to analyze the overall
behavior of the interstellar extinction by means of the red-clump population,
and we apply it to those areas of the Milky Way where the presence of
interstellar matter is heavily felt: areas located in 5 deg<l<30 deg and b=0
deg. We show that the extinction ratios traditionally used for the near
infrared could be inappropriate for the inner Galaxy and we analyze the
behavior of the extinction law from 1 to 8 microns.
