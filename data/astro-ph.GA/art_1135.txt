Ionized gas, molecules, and dust in Sh2-132
We analyze the various interstellar components of the HII region Sh2-132. The
main stellar source is the double binary system that includes the Wolf-Rayet
star WR153ab. We use radio continuum images at 408 and 1420 MHz, and HI 21cm
line data taken from the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey, molecular observations
of the 12CO(1-0) line at 115 GHz from the Five College Radio Astronomy
Observatory, and available mid and far IR observations obtained with the MSX
and IRAS satellites, respectively.
  Sh2-132 is composed of two shells showing radio continuum counterparts at
both frequencies. The emission is thermal in nature. The estimated rms electron
density and ionized mass of the nebula are n_e = 20 cm^{-3} and M_HII = 1500
Mo. The distribution of the CO emission shows molecular gas bordering the
ionized nebula and interacting with it. The velocities of the molecular gas is
in the range --38 to --53 km/s, similar to the velocity of the ionized gas. The
emission at 8.3 mic. reveals a ring like feature of about 15' that encircles
the bright optical regions. This emission is due to the PAHs and marks the
location of photodissociation regions.
  The gas distribution in the environs of Sh2-132 can be explained in a
scenario where the massive stars in the region photodissociated, ionized, and
swept-up the dense molecular material from the parental cloud through their
strong stellar winds and intense UV photon flux.
