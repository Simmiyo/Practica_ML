Discovery of a Gas-Rich Companion to the Extremely Metal-Poor Galaxy DDO
  68
We present HI spectral-line imaging of the extremely metal-poor galaxy DDO
68. This system has a nebular oxygen abundance of only 3% Z$_{\odot}$, making
it one of the most metal-deficient galaxies known in the local volume.
Surprisingly, DDO 68 is a relatively massive and luminous galaxy for its metal
content, making it a significant outlier in the mass-metallicity and
luminosity-metallicity relationships. The origin of such a low oxygen abundance
in DDO 68 presents a challenge for models of the chemical evolution of
galaxies. One possible solution to this problem is the infall of pristine
neutral gas, potentially initiated during a gravitational interaction. Using
archival HI spectral-line imaging obtained with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large
Array, we have discovered a previously unknown companion of DDO 68. This
low-mass (M$_{\rm HI}$ $=$ 2.8$\times$10$^{7}$ M$_{\odot}$), recently
star-forming (SFR$_{\rm FUV}$ $=$ 1.4$\times$10$^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$,
SFR$_{\rm H\alpha}$ $<$ 7$\times$10$^{-5}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) companion has
the same systemic velocity as DDO 68 (V$_{\rm sys}$ $=$ 506 km s$^{-1}$; D $=$
12.74$\pm$0.27 Mpc) and is located at a projected distance of 42 kpc. New HI
maps obtained with the 100m Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope provide
evidence that DDO 68 and this companion are gravitationally interacting at the
present time. Low surface brightness HI gas forms a bridge between these
objects.
