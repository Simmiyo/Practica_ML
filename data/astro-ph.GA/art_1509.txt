Compact HI clouds from the GALFA-HI survey
The Galactic Arecibo L-band Feed Array HI (GALFA-HI) survey is mapping the
entire Arecibo sky at 21-cm, over a velocity range of -700 to +700 km/s (LSR),
at a velocity resolution of 0.18 km/s and a spatial resolution of 3.5 arcmin.
The unprecedented resolution and sensitivity of the GALFA-HI survey have
resulted in the detection of numerous isolated, very compact HI clouds at low
Galactic velocities, which are distinctly separated from the HI disk emission.
In the limited area of ~4600 deg$^2$ surveyed so far, we have detected 96 of
such compact clouds. The detected clouds are cold with a median T$_{k,max}$
(the kinetic temperature in the case in which there is no non-thermal
broadening) of 300 K. Moreover, these clouds are quite compact and faint, with
median values of 5 arcmin in angular size, 0.75 K in peak brightness
temperature, and $5 \times 10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$ in HI column density. Most of the
clouds deviate from Galactic rotation at the 20-30 km/s level, and a
significant fraction show evidence for a multiphase medium and velocity
gradients. No counterparts for these clouds were found in other wavebands. From
the modeling of spatial and velocity distributions of the whole compact cloud
population, we find that the bulk of the compact clouds are related to the
Galactic disk, and their distances are likely to be in the range of 0.1 to a
few kpc. We discuss various possible scenarios for the formation and
maintenance of this cloud population and its significance for Galactic ISM
studies.
