Ultra-Compact Dwarfs around NGC 3268
We present radial velocities (from Gemini/GMOS) of the second sample of
ultra-compact dwarfs (UCDs) and bright globular clusters (GCs) in the Antlia
cluster. Twenty-three objects are located around the giant elliptical NGC 3268,
and one is close to the fainter lenticular NGC 3273. Together with previously
found UCDs around NGC 3258 a total of 35 UCDs and bright GCs has been now
identified in the Antlia cluster. Their colours and magnitudes are compared
with those of the nuclei of dE,N galaxies already confirmed as Antlia members.
For a subsample that lie on ACS images and are brighter than M_V = -9 mag, the
effective radii (R_eff) have been measured, the maximum radius being
approximately 10 pc. In addition to the radial velocity sample, we find 10
objects in the magnitude range corresponding to GCs but with 10 < R_eff < 17
pc, resembling the so-called `extended clusters'. By number and magnitude, the
new UCDs fit to the GC luminosity function, supporting their interpretation as
bright GCs. Additionally, we use a tracer mass estimator to calculate the mass
enclosed up to ~47 kpc from NGC 3268, which results in 2.7 x 10^12 M_o.
