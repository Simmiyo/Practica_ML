Spitzer reveals what's behind Orion's Bar
We present Spitzer Space Telescope observations of 11 regions SE of the
Bright Bar in the Orion Nebula, along a radial from the exciting star
theta1OriC, extending from 2.6 to 12.1'. Our Cycle 5 programme obtained deep
spectra with matching IRS short-high (SH) and long-high (LH) aperture grid
patterns. Most previous IR missions observed only the inner few arcmin. Orion
is the benchmark for studies of the ISM particularly for elemental abundances.
Spitzer observations provide a unique perspective on the Ne and S abundances by
virtue of observing the dominant ionization states of Ne (Ne+, Ne++) and S
(S++, S3+) in Orion and H II regions in general. The Ne/H abundance ratio is
especially well determined, with a value of (1.01+/-0.08)E-4. We obtained
corresponding new ground-based spectra at CTIO. These optical data are used to
estimate the electron temperature, electron density, optical extinction, and
the S+/S++ ratio at each of our Spitzer positions. That permits an adjustment
for the total gas-phase S abundance because no S+ line is observed by Spitzer.
The gas-phase S/H abundance ratio is (7.68+/-0.30)E-6. The Ne/S abundance ratio
may be determined even when the weaker hydrogen line, H(7-6) here, is not
measured. The mean value, adjusted for the optical S+/S++ ratio, is Ne/S =
13.0+/-0.6. We derive the electron density versus distance from theta1OriC for
[S III] and [S II]. Both distributions are for the most part decreasing with
increasing distance. A dramatic find is the presence of high-ionization Ne++
all the way to the outer optical boundary ~12' from theta1OriC. This IR result
is robust, whereas the optical evidence from observations of high-ionization
species (e.g. O++) at the outer optical boundary suffers uncertainty because of
scattering of emission from the much brighter inner Huygens Region.
