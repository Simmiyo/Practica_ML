High Excitation Molecular Gas in the Galactic Center Loops; 12CO(J =2-1
  and J =3-2) Observations
We have carried out 12CO(J =2-1) and 12CO(J =3-2) observations at spatial
resolutions of 1.0-3.8 pc toward the entirety of loops 1 and 2 and part of loop
3 in the Galactic center with NANTEN2 and ASTE. These new results revealed
detailed distributions of the molecular gas and the line intensity ratio of the
two transitions, R3-2/2-1. In the three loops, R3-2/2-1 is in a range from 0.1
to 2.5 with a peak at ~ 0.7 while that in the disk molecular gas is in a range
from 0.1 to 1.2 with a peak at 0.4. This supports that the loops are more
highly excited than the disk molecular gas. An LVG analysis of three
transitions, 12CO J =3-2 and 2-1 and 13CO J =2-1, toward six positions in loops
1 and 2 shows density and temperature are in a range 102.2 - 104.7 cm-3 and
15-100 K or higher, respectively. Three regions extended by 50-100 pc in the
loops tend to have higher excitation conditions as characterized by R3-2/2-1
greater than 1.2. The highest ratio of 2.5 is found in the most developed foot
points between loops 1 and 2. This is interpreted that the foot points indicate
strongly shocked conditions as inferred from their large linewidths of 50-100
km s-1, confirming the suggestion by Torii et al. (2010b). The other two
regions outside the foot points suggest that the molecular gas is heated up by
some additional heating mechanisms possibly including magnetic reconnection. A
detailed analysis of four foot points have shown a U shape, an L shape or a
mirrored-L shape in the b-v distribution. It is shown that a simple kinematical
model which incorporates global rotation and expansion of the loops is able to
explain these characteristic shapes.
