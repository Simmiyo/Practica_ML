Quasar Metal Abundance and FIR Luminosity
We compare the metallicities in high-redshift quasars to the star formation
rates (SFR) in their host galaxies using measurements of broad emission lines
and far-infrared (FIR) luminosities. The FIR emission indicates the level of
ongoing massive starbursts in the galaxy, whereas the abundance of metals in
the gas surrounding the quasar indicates the amount of star formation which
occurred before the visible quasar phase began. The results of this study can
be used to constrain the late stages of starburst-quasar evolution. We detect
high metallicities throughout the sample, up to several times solar, confirming
that star formation must have begun before the visible quasar phase. However,
we do not detect a trend in metallicity versus current SFR.
