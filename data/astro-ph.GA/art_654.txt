Dynamics and Depletion in Thermally Supercritical Starless Cores
In previous studies we identified two classes of starless cores, thermally
subcritical and supercritical, distinguished by different dynamical behavior
and internal structure. Here we study the evolution of the
dynamically-unstable, thermally-supercritical cores by means of a numerical
hydrodynamic simulation that includes radiative equilibrium and simple
molecular chemistry. We use our non-LTE radiative transfer code MOLLIE to
predict observable CO and N2H+ line spectra, including the non-LTE hyperfine
ratios of N2H+, during the contraction. These are compared against observations
of the starless core L1544.
