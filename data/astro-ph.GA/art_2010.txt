VLA Observations of the Infrared Dark Cloud G19.30+0.07
We present Very Large Array observations of ammonia (NH3) (1,1), (2,2), and
CCS (2_1-1_0) emission toward the Infrared Dark Cloud (IRDC) G19.30+0.07 at
~22GHz. The NH3 emission closely follows the 8 micron extinction. The NH3 (1,1)
and (2,2) lines provide diagnostics of the temperature and density structure
within the IRDC, with typical rotation temperatures of ~10 to 20K and NH3
column densities of ~10^15 cm^-2. The estimated total mass of G19.30+0.07 is
~1130 Msun. The cloud comprises four compact NH3 clumps of mass ~30 to 160
Msun. Two coincide with 24 micron emission, indicating heating by protostars,
and show evidence of outflow in the NH3 emission. We report a water maser
associated with a third clump; the fourth clump is apparently starless. A
non-detection of 8.4GHz emission suggests that the IRDC contains no bright HII
regions, and places a limit on the spectral type of an embedded ZAMS star to
early-B or later. From the NH3 emission we find G19.30+0.07 is composed of
three distinct velocity components, or "subclouds." One velocity component
contains the two 24 micron sources and the starless clump, another contains the
clump with the water maser, while the third velocity component is diffuse, with
no significant high-density peaks. The spatial distribution of NH3 and CCS
emission from G19.30+0.07 is highly anti-correlated, with the NH3 predominantly
in the high-density clumps, and the CCS tracing lower-density envelopes around
those clumps. This spatial distribution is consistent with theories of
evolution for chemically young low-mass cores, in which CCS has not yet been
processed to other species and/or depleted in high-density regions.
