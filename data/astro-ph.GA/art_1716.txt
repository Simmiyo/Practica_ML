A model of Mira's cometary head/tail entering the Local Bubble
We model the cometary structure around Mira as the interaction of an AGB wind
from Mira A, and a streaming environment. Our simulations introduce the
following new element: we assume that after 200 kyr of evolution in a dense
environment Mira entered the Local Bubble (low density coronal gas). As Mira
enters the bubble, the head of the comet expands quite rapidly, while the tail
remains well collimated for a 100 kyr timescale. The result is a
broad-head/narrow-tail structure that resembles the observed morphology of
Mira's comet. The simulations were carried out with our new adaptive grid code
WALICXE, which is described in detail.
