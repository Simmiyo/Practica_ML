The bulk kinetic power of radio jets in active galactic nuclei
Based on the K\"onigl's inhomogeneous jet model, we estimate the jet
parameters, such as bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma$, viewing angle $\theta$ and
electron number density $n_{\rm e}$ from radio VLBI and X-ray data for a sample
of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) assuming that the X-rays are from the jet
rather than the intracluster gas. The bulk kinetic power of jets is then
calculated using the derived jet parameters. We find a strong correlation
between the total luminosity of broad emission lines and the bulk kinetic power
of the jets. This result supports the scenario that the accretion process are
tightly linked with the radio jets, though how the disk and jet are coupled is
not revealed by present correlation analysis. Moreover, we find a significant
correlation between the bulk kinetic power and radio extended luminosity. This
implies that the emission from the radio lobes are closely related with the
energy flux transported through jets from the central part of AGNs.
