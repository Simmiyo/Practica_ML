Gas and Dust in the Magellanic Clouds
The far-ultraviolet (FUV) diffuse emission is predominantly due to scattering
of starlight from interstellar dust grains which shows a large regional
variation depending on the relative orientations of dust and stars. The
observations of the FUV (1000 -- 1150 \AA) diffuse radiation in the Magellanic
Clouds (MCs) using serendipitous observations made with the Far Ultraviolet
{\em Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE)} are presented. The estimated contribution
of FUV diffuse radiation to the total integrated FUV emission in the MCs is
found to be typically 5% -- 20% in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and 34% --
44% in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) at the {\em FUSE} bands ($\lambda$ =
905 -- 1187 \AA) and it increases substantially towards the longer wavelength
(e.g., 63% for the SMC at 1615 \AA). The less scattering of light in the FUV at
the shorter wavelength than at the longer wavelength indicates that much of the
stellar radiation at the shorter wavelength is going into heating the
interstellar dust.
  Five times ionized oxygen atom (O {\small VI}) is a tracer of hot gas (T
$\sim 3\times 10^{5}$ K) in the interstellar medium (ISM). A wide survey of O
{\small VI} column density measurements for the LMC is presented using the high
resolution {\em FUSE} spectra. The column density varies from a minimum of log
N(O {\small VI}) = 13.72 atoms cm$^{-2}$ to a maximum of log N(O {\small VI}) =
14.57 atoms cm$^{-2}$. A high abundance of O {\small VI} is observed in both
active (superbubbles) and inactive regions of the LMC.
