Identifying Compact Symmetric Objects from the VLBA Imaging and
  Polarization Survey
Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) are small (less than 1 kpc) radio sources
which have symmetric double lobes or jets. The dominant theory for the small
size of these objects is that they are young radio sources which could grow
into larger radio galaxies, but the currently small population of known CSOs
makes it difficult to definitively determine whether or not this is the case.
While a greater number of Gigahertz peaked sources can be identified by sifting
through spectral surveys, this yields none of the dynamics of the sources, and
also brings Quasars into the sample, which although interesting are peaked
around 1 Gigahertz for very different reasons. We have used the 5 GHz VLBA
Imaging and Polarization Survey (VIPS) to identify 103 CSO candidates
morphologically, and are following up on these sources with multifrequency VLBA
observations to confirm CSO identifications and to study their dynamics. The
identification of candidates from within the survey will be discussed, as well
as preliminary results from the follow-up observations.
