Local Kinematics and the Local Standard of Rest
We re-examine the stellar kinematics of the Solar neighbourhood in terms of
the velocity of the Sun with respect to the local standard of rest. We show
that the classical determination of its component V_sun in the direction of
Galactic rotation via Stroemberg's relation is undermined by the metallicity
gradient in the disc, which introduces a correlation between the colour of a
group of stars and the radial gradients of its properties. Comparing the local
stellar kinematics to a chemodynamical model which accounts for these effects,
we obtain (U,V,W)_sun = (11.1 +/- 0.74, 12.24 +/- 0.47, 7.25 +/-0.37) km/s,
with additional systematic uncertainties of ~ (1,2,0.5) km/s. In particular,
V_sun is 7 km/s larger than previously estimated. The new values of solar
motion are extremely insensitive to the metallicity gradient within the disc.
