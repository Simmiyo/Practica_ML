Why are most molecular clouds not gravitationally bound?
The most recent observational evidence seems to indicate that giant molecular
clouds are predominantly gravitationally unbound objects. In this paper we show
that this is a natural consequence of a scenario in which cloud-cloud
collisions and stellar feedback regulate the internal velocity dispersion of
the gas, and so prevent global gravitational forces from becoming dominant.
Thus, while the molecular gas is for the most part gravitationally unbound,
local regions within the denser parts of the gas (within the clouds) do become
bound and are able to form stars. We find that the observations, in terms of
distributions of virial parameters and cloud structures, can be well modelled
provided that the star formation efficiency in these bound regions is of order
5 - 10 percent. We also find that in this picture the constituent gas of
individual molecular clouds changes over relatively short time scales,
typically a few Myr.
