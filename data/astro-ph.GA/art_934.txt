A kinematic study of Open Clusters: implications for their origin
The Galactic population of open clusters provides an insight into star
formation in the Galaxy. The open cluster catalogue by Dias et al.(2002b) is a
rich source of data, including kinematic information. This large sample made it
possible to carry out a systematic analysis of 481 open cluster orbits, using
parameters based on orbit eccentricity and separation from the Galactic plane.
These two parameters may be indicative of origin, and we find them to be
correlated. We also find them to be correlated with metallicity, another
parameter suggested elsewhere to be a marker for origin in that high values of
any of these two parameters generally indicates a low metallicity ([Fe/H]
Solar$<-$0.2 dex). The resulting analysis points to four open clusters in the
catalogue being of extra-Galactic origin by impact of high velocity cloud on
the disk: Berkeley21, 32, 99, and Melotte66, with a possible further four due
to this origin (NGC2158, 2420, 7789, IC1311). A further three may be due to
Galactic globular cluster impact on the disk i.e of internal Galactic origin
(NGC6791, 1817, and 7044).
