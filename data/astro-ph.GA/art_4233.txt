Newly identified YSO candidates towards the LDN 1188
We present an analysis of Young Stellar Object (YSO) candidates towards the
LDN 1188 molecular cloud. The YSO candidates were selected from the WISE
all-sky catalogue, based on a statistical method. We found 601 candidates in
the region, and classified them as Class I, Flat and Class II YSOs. Groups were
identified and described with the Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) method.
Previously identified molecular cores show evidence of ongoing star formation
at different stages throughout the cloud complex.
