A Catalog of MIPSGAL Disk and Ring Sources
We present a catalog of 416 extended, resolved, disk- and ring-like objects
as detected in the MIPSGAL 24 micron survey of the Galactic plane. This catalog
is the result of a search in the MIPSGAL image data for generally circularly
symmetric, extended "bubbles" without prior knowledge or expectation of their
physical nature. Most of the objects have no extended counterpart at 8 or 70
micron, with less than 20% detections at each wavelength. For the 54 objects
with central point sources, the sources are nearly always seen in all IRAC
bands. About 70 objects (16%) have been previously identified, with another 35
listed as IRAS sources. Among the identified objects, those with central
sources are mostly listed as emission-line stars, but with other source types
including supernova remnants, luminous blue variables, and planetary nebulae.
The 57 identified objects (of 362) without central sources are nearly all PNe
(~90%).which suggests that a large fraction of the 300+ unidentified objects in
this category are also PNe. These identifications suggest that this is
primarily a catalog of evolved stars. Also included in the catalog are two
filamentary objects that are almost certainly SNRs, and ten unusual compact
extended objects discovered in the search. Two of these show remarkable spiral
structure at both 8 and 24 micron. These are likely background galaxies
previously hidden by the intervening Galactic plane.
