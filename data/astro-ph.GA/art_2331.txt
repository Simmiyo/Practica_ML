Improved distances to several Galactic OB associations
Based on uvbybeta photometry we study the structure of several Galactic
star-forming fields. Lac OB1 is a compact association at 520+/-20 pc spatially
correlated with a region of intense HII emission in Sh2-126. Loden 112 is a
compact OB group at 1630+/-82 pc, probably connected to an extended feature of
OB stars located toward the Carina tangent. The field toward Car OB1 is complex
and likely contains apparent concentrations representing parts of long segments
of the Carina arm projected along the line of sight. Within the classical Mon
OB2 association we separate a relatively compact group at 1.26 kpc, that is
spatially correlated to the Monoceros Loop SN remnant.
