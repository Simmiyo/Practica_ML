Made-to measure galaxy models - I Methodology
We re-derive the made-to-measure method of Syer and Tremaine 1996, for
modelling stellar systems and individual galaxies, and demonstrate how
extensions to the made-to-measure method may be implemented and used. We
illustrate the enhanced made-to-measure method by determining the mass-to-light
ratio of a galaxy modelled as a Plummer sphere. From the standard galactic
observables of surface brightness and line-of-sight velocity dispersion
together with the h_4 Gauss-Hermite coefficient of the line-of-sight velocity
distribution, we successfully recover the true mass-to-light ratio of our toy
galaxy. Using kinematic data from Kleyna et al 2002, we then estimate the
mass-to-light ratio of the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Draco achieving a V-band
value of 539 \pm 136 M_{\odot} / L_{\odot}. We describe the main aspects of
creating a made-to-measure galaxy model and show how the key modelling
parameters may be determined.
