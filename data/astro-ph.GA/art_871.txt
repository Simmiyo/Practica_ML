Using a coordinate-independent impact parameter in the
  post-post-Newtonian light deflection formulas
In [2] we have seen that among the post-post-Newtonian terms in the light
deflection formulas there are "enhanced" ones that may become much larger than
the other post-post-Newtonian terms. It is demonstrated here that these
"enhanced" terms result from an inadequate choice of the impact parameter.
Introducing another impact parameter, that can be considered as
coordinate-independent, we demonstrate that all "enhanced" terms disappear from
the formulas.
