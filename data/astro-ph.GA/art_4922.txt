Newly Discovered RR Lyrae Stars in the SDSSXPanXSTARRS1XCatalina
  Footprint
We present the detection of 6,371 RR Lyrae (RRL) stars distributed across
~14,000 deg^2 of the sky from the combined data of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS), the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System 1 (PS1), and
the second photometric catalogue from the Catalina Survey (CSDR2), out of
these, ~2,021 RRL stars (~572 RRab and 1,449 RRc) are new discoveries. The RRL
stars have heliocentric distances in the 4--28 kpc distance range. RRL-like
color cuts from the SDSS and variability cuts from the PS1 are used to cull our
candidate list. We then use the CSDR2 multi-epoch data to refine our sample.
Periods were measured using the Analysis of Variance technique while the
classification process is performed with the Template Fitting Method in
addition to the visual inspection of the light curves. A cross-match of our RRL
star discoveries with previous published catalogs of RRL stars yield
completeness levels of ~50% for both RRab and RRc stars, and an efficiency of
~99% and ~87% for RRab and RRc stars, respectively. We show that our method for
selecting RRL stars allows us to recover halo structures. The full lists of all
the RRL stars are made publicly available.
