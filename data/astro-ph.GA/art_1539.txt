Mass of Galactic Lenses in Modified Newtonian Dynamics
Using strong lensing data Milgrom's MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) or its
covariant TeVeS (Tensor-Vector-Scalar Theory) is being examined here as an
alternative to the conventional $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. We examine 10
double-image gravitational lensing systems, in which the lens masses have been
estimated by stellar population synthesis models. While mild deviations exist,
we do not find out that strong cases for outliers to the TeVeS theory.
