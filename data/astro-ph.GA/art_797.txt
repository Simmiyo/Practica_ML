Intermittency of interstellar turbulence: extreme velocity-shears and CO
  emission on milliparsec scale
The condensation of diffuse gas into molecular clouds occurs at a rate driven
largely by turbulent dissipation. This process still has to be caught in action
and characterized. A mosaic of 13 fields was observed in the CO(1-0) line with
the IRAM-PdB interferometer in the translucent environment of two low-mass
dense cores. The large size of the mosaic compared to the resolution (4 arcsec)
is unprecedented in the study of the small-scale structure of diffuse molecular
gas. Eight weak and elongated structures of thicknesses as small as 3 mpc (600
AU) and lengths up to 70mpc are found. These are not filaments because once
merged with short-spacing data, they appear as the sharp edges of larger-scale
structures. Six out of eight form quasi-parallel pairs at different velocities
and different position angles. This cannot be the result of chance alignment.
The velocity-shears estimated for the three pairs include the highest ever
measured far from star forming regions (780 km/s/pc). Because the large scale
structures have sharp edges, with little or no overlap, they have to be thin
CO-layers. Their edges mark a sharp transition between a CO-rich component and
a gas undetected in the CO line because of its low CO abundance, presumably the
cold neutral medium. We propose that these sharp edges are the first
directly-detected manifestations of the intermittency of interstellar
turbulence. The large velocity-shears reveal an intense straining field,
responsible for a local dissipation rate several orders of magnitude above
average, possibly at the origin of the thin CO-layers.
