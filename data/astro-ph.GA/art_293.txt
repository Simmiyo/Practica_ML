Suzaku Observation Adjacent to the South End of the Radio Arc
Suzaku observed the Galactic center region near the Radio Arc at ~20'
southeast of Sagittarius A*.In the 18'x18' field of view, we found four
distinct X-ray sources: a bright star and a diffuse source associated with the
star clusters in the soft band (0.5-2.0 keV), a small clump in a higher energy
band (4-6 keV), and a peculiar clump in the 6.4 keV line band.The latter two
clumps are located at the south end of the Radio Arc. This paper reports on the
results, and discusses the origin of these X-ray sources, with a particular
emphasis on small clumps.
