Astrometry of H$_2$O masers in the massive star--forming region IRAS
  06061+2151 with VERA
We measured the trigonometric annual parallax of H$_2$O maser source
associated with the massive star-forming regions IRAS 06061+2151 with VERA. The
annual parallax of $0.496\pm0.031$ mas corresponding to a distance of
$2.02^{+0.13}_{-0.12}$ kpc was obtained by 10 epochs of observations from 2007
October to 2009 September. This distance was obtained with a higher accuracy
than the photometric distance previously measured, and places IRAS 06061+2151
in the Perseus spiral arm. We found that IRAS 06061+2151 also has a peculiar
motion of larger than 15 km s$^{-1}$ counter to the Galactic rotation. That is
similar to five sources in the Perseus spiral arm, whose parallaxes and proper
motions have already been measured with higher accuracy. Moreover, these
sources move at on average 27 km s$^{-1}$ toward the Galactic center and
counter to the Galactic rotation.
