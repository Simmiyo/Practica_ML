Non-linear Schroedinger Equations, Separation and Symmetry
We investigate the symmetry properties of hierarchies of non-linear
Schroedinger equations (introduced by Doebner and Goldin, and Goldin and
Svetlichny), which describe non-interacting systems in which tensor product
wave-functions evolve by independent evolution of the factors (the separation
property). We show that there are obstructions to lifting symmetries existing
at a certain number of particles to higher numbers. Such obstructions vanish
for particles without internal degrees of freedom and the usual space-time
symmetries. For particles with internal degrees of freedom, such as spin, these
obstructions are present and their circumvention requires a choice of a new
term in the equation for each particle number. A Lie-algebra approach for
non-linear theories is developed.
