Spin in a variable magnetic field: the adiabatic approximation
The problem of spin precession in a time-dependent magnetic field is
considered in the adiabatic approximation where the field direction or the
angular velocity of its rotation is changing slowly. The precession angles are
given by integrals in a way similar to the semi-classical approximation for the
Schr\"{o}dinger equation.
