Experimental realization of a highly structured search algorithm
The highly structured search algorithm proposed by Hogg[Phys.Rev.Lett.
80,2473(1998)] is implemented experimentally for the 1-SAT problem in a single
search step by using nuclear magnetic resonance technique with two-qubit
sample. It is the first demonstration of the Hogg's algorithm, and can be
readily extended to solving 1-SAT problem for more qubits in one step if the
appropriate samples possessing more qubits are experimentally feasible.
