Quantum Mechanics helps in searching for a needle in a haystack
Quantum mechanics can speed up a range of search applications over unsorted
data. For example imagine a phone directory containing N names arranged in
completely random order. To find someone's phone number with a probability of
50%, any classical algorithm (whether deterministic or probabilistic) will need
to access the database a minimum of O(N) times. Quantum mechanical systems can
be in a superposition of states and simultaneously examine multiple names. By
properly adjusting the phases of various operations, successful computations
reinforce each other while others interfere randomly. As a result, the desired
phone number can be obtained in only O(sqrt(N)) accesses to the database.
