Simulating the Effect of Decoherence and Inaccuracies on a Quantum
  Computer
A Quantum Computer is a new type of computer which can solve problems such as
factoring and database search very efficiently. The usefulness of a quantum
computer is limited by the effect of two different types of errors, decoherence
and inaccuracies. In this paper we show the results of simulations of a quantum
computer which consider both decoherence and inaccuracies. We simulate circuits
which factor the numbers 15, 21, 35, and 57 as well as circuits which use
database search to solve the circuit satisfaction problem. Our simulations show
that the error rate per gate is on the order of 10^-6 for a trapped ion quantum
computer whose noise is kept below pi/4096 per gate and with a decoherence rate
of 10^-6. This is an important bound because previous studies have shown that a
quantum computer can factor more efficiently than a classical computer if the
error rate is of order 10^-6.
