The phase representation of covariant phase observables
Covariant phase observables are obtained by defining simple conditions for
mappings from the set of phase wave functions (unit vectors of the Hardy space)
to the set of phase probability densities. The existence of phase probability
density for any phase wave function, the existence of interference effects, and
the natural phase shift covariance are those simple conditions. The
nonlocalizability of covariant phase observables is proved.
