An Intutive Paragidm for Quantum Mechanics
Use is made of a relativistic kinematic modulation effect to compliment
imagery from Stochastic Electrodynamics to provide intuitive paradigms for
Quantum Mechanics. Based on these paradigms, resolutions for epistemological
problems vexing conventional interpretations of Quantum Mechanics are proposed
and discussed.
