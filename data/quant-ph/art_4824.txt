Analytic stochastic treatment of a nonlinear quantum model with negative
  diffusion
We apply a proposal of Yuen and Tombesi, for treating stochastic problems
with negative diffusion, to the analytically soluble problem of the single-mode
anharmonic oscillator. We find that the associated stochastic realizations
include divergent trajectories. It is possible, however, to solve the
stochastic problem exactly, but the averaging must be performed with great
care.
