A New Class of Adiabatic Cyclic States and Geometric Phases for
  Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians
For a T-periodic non-Hermitian Hamiltonian H(t), we construct a class of
adiabatic cyclic states of period T which are not eigenstates of the initial
Hamiltonian H(0). We show that the corresponding adiabatic geometric phase
angles are real and discuss their relationship with the conventional complex
adiabatic geometric phase angles. We present a detailed calculation of the new
adiabatic cyclic states and their geometric phases for a non-Hermitian analog
of the spin 1/2 particle in a precessing magnetic field.
