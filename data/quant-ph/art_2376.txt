Quasi-set-theoretical foundations of statistical mechanics: a research
  program
Quasi-set theory provides us a mathematical background for dealing with
collections of indistinguishable elementary particles. In this paper, we show
how to obtain the usual statistics (Maxwell-Boltzmann, Bose-Einstein, and
Fermi-Dirac) into the scope of quasi-set theory. We also show that, in order to
derive Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics, it is not necessary to assume that the
particles are distinguishable. In other words, Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics is
possible even in an ensamble of indistinguishable particles, at least from the
theoretical point of view. The main goal of this paper is to provide the
mathematical grounds of a quasi-set-theoretical framework for statistical
mechanics.
