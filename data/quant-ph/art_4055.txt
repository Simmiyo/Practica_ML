Quantum authentication of classical messages
Although key distribution is arguably the most studied context on which to
apply quantum cryptographic techniques, message authentication, i.e.,
certifying the identity of the message originator and the integrity of the
message sent, can also benefit from the use of quantum resources. Classically,
message authentication can be performed by techniques based on hash functions.
However, the security of the resulting protocols depends on the selection of
appropriate hash functions, and on the use of long authentication keys. In this
paper we propose a quantum authentication procedure that, making use of just
one qubit as the authentication key, allows the authentication of binary
classical messages in a secure manner.
