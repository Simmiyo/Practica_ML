Non-classical interference between independent sources
When a one-photon state is mixed with a (separate) weak coherent state at a
beamsplitter the probability for detecting one photon in each beamsplitter
output approaches zero due to destructive interference. We demonstrate this
non-classical interference effect using pulse-gated single photons and weak
mode-locked laser pulses.
