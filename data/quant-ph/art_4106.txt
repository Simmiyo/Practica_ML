Mutually unbiased binary observable sets on N qubits
The Pauli operators (tensor products of Pauli matrices) provide a complete
basis of operators on the Hilbert space of N qubits. We prove that the set of
4^N-1 Pauli operators may be partitioned into 2^N+1 distinct subsets, each
consisting of 2^N-1 internally commuting observables. Furthermore, each such
partitioning defines a unique choice of 2^N+1 mutually unbiased basis sets in
the N-qubit Hilbert space. Examples for 2 and 3 qubit systems are discussed
with emphasis on the nature and amount of entanglement that occurs within these
basis sets.
