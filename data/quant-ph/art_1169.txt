Computing Local Invariants of Qubit Systems
We investigate means to describe the non-local properties of quantum systems
and to test if two quantum systems are locally equivalent. For this we consider
quantum systems that consist of several subsystems, especially multiple qubits.
We compute invariant polynomials, i. e., polynomial functions of the entries of
the density operator which are invariant under local unitary operations.
  As an example, we consider a system of two qubits. We compute the Molien
series for the corresponding representation which gives information about the
number of linearly independent invariants. Furthermore, we present a set of
polynomials which generate all invariants (at least) up to degree 23. Finally,
the use of invariants to check whether two density operators are locally
equivalent is demonstrated.
