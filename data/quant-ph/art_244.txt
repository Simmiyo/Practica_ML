Geometric Phases, Coherent States and Resonant Hamiltonian
We study characteristic aspects of the geometric phase which is associated
with the generalized coherent states. This is determined by special orbits in
the parameter space defining the coherent state, which is obtained as a
solution of the variational equation governed by a simple model Hamiltonian
called the "resonant Hamiltonian". Three typical coherent states are
considered: SU(2), SU(1,1) and Heisenberg-Weyl. A possible experimental
detection of the phases is proposed in such a way that the geometric phases can
be discriminated from the dynamical phase.
