Moving quantum agents in a finite environment
We investigate an all-quantum-mechanical spin network, in which a subset of
spins, the $K$ ``moving agents'', are subject to local and pair unitary
transformations controlled by their position with respect to a fixed ring of
$M$ ``environmental''-spins. We demonstrate that a ``flow of coherence''
results between the various subsystems. Despite entanglement between the agents
and between agent and environment, local (non-linear) invariants may persist,
which then show up as fascinating patterns in each agent's Bloch-sphere. Such
patterns disappear, though, if the agents are controlled by different rules.
Geometric aspects thus help to understand the interplay between entanglement
and decoherence.
