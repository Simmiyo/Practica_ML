The Error Principle
The problem of characterising the accuracy of, and disturbance caused by a
joint measurement of position and momentum is investigated. In a previous paper
the problem was discussed in the context of the unbiased measurements
considered by Arthurs and Kelly. It is now shown, that suitably modified
versions of these results hold for a much larger class of simultaneous
measurements. The approach is a development of that adopted by Braginsky and
Khalili in the case of a single measurement of position only. A distinction is
made between the errors of retrodiction and the errors of prediction. Two
error-error relationships and four error-disturbance relationships are derived,
supplementing the Uncertainty Principle usually so-called. In the general case
it is necessary to take into account the range of the measuring apparatus. Both
the ideal case, of an instrument having infinite range, and the case of a real
instrument, for which the range is finite, are discussed.
