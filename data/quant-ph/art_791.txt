Photon Distribution Function for Stocks Wave for Stimulatted Raman
  Scattering
New time-dependent integrals of motion are found for stimulated Raman
scattering. Explicit formula for the photon-number probability distribution as
a function of the laser-field intensity and the medium parameters is obtained
in terms of Hermite polynomials of two variables.
