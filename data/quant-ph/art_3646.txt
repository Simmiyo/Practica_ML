Sources of quantum waves
Due to the space and time dependence of the wave function in the time
dependent Schroedinger equation, different boundary conditions are possible.
The equation is usually solved as an ``initial value problem'', by fixing the
value of the wave function in all space at a given instant. We compare this
standard approach to "source boundary conditions'' that fix the wave at all
times in a given region, in particular at a point in one dimension. In contrast
to the well-known physical interpretation of the initial-value-problem
approach, the interpretation of the source approach has remained unclear, since
it introduces negative energy components, even for ``free motion'', and a
time-dependent norm. This work provides physical meaning to the source method
by finding the link with equivalent initial value problems.
