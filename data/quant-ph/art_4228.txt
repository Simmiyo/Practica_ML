Klein Paradox for Optical Scattering from Excited Targets
The well known Klein paradox for the relativistic Dirac wave equation
consists in the computation of possible ``negative probabilities'' induced by
certain potentials in some regimes of energy. The paradox may be resolved
employing the notion of electron-positron pair production in which the number
of electrons present in a process can increase. The Klein paradox also exists
in Maxwell's equations viewed as the wave equation for photons. In a medium
containing ``inverted energy populations'' of excited atoms, e.g. in a LASER
medium, one may again compute possible ``negative probabilities''. The
resolution of the electromagnetic Klein paradox is that when the atoms decay,
the final state may contain more photons then were contained the initial state.
The optical theorem total cross section for scattering photons from excited
state atoms may then be computed as negative within a frequency band with
matter induced amplification.
