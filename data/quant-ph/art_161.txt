Coherent States for Isospectral Hamiltonians
We show that for the strictly isospectral Hamiltonians, the corresponding
coherent states are related by a unitary transformation. As an illustration, we
discuss, the example of strictly isospectral one-dimensional harmonic
oscillator Hamiltonians and the associated coherent states.
