A Hamiltonian for the description of a non-relativistic spin-1/2 free
  particle
We propose a Hamiltonian for a nonrelativistic spin 1/2 \QTR{it}{free}
particle (e.g. an electron) and find that it contains information of its
internal degrees of freedom in the rest coordinate system. We comment on the
dynamical symmetry associated with the electron \QTR{it}{Zitterbewegung}.
