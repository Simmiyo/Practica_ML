Unifying Approach to Software and Hardware Design for Scientific
  Calculations
A unifying approach to software and hardware design generated by ideas of
Idempotent Mathematics is discussed. The so-called idempotent correspondence
principle for algorithms, programs and hardware units is described. A software
project based on this approach is presented.
  Key words: universal algorithms, idempotent calculus, software design,
hardware design, object oriented programming
