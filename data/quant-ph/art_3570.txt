Low-energy relativistic effects and nonlocality in time-dependent
  tunneling
We consider exact time-dependent analytic solutions to the Schr\"odinger
equation for tunneling in one dimension with cut off wave initial conditions at
$t=0$. We obtain that as soon as $t \neq 0$ the transmitted probability density
at any arbitrary distance rises instantaneously with time in a linear manner.
Using a simple model we find that the above nonlocal effect of the
time-dependent solution is suppressed by consideration of low-energy
relativistic effects. Hence at a distance $x_0$ from the potential the
probability density rises after a time $t_0=x_0/c$ restoring Einstein
causality. This implies that the tunneling time of a particle can never be
zero.
