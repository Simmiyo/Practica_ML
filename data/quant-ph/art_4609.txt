Preparation of polarization entangled mixed states of two photons
We propose a scheme for preparing arbitrary two photons polarization
entangled mixed states via controlled location decoherence. The scheme uses
only linear optical devices and single-mode optical fibers, and may be feasible
in experiment within current optical technology.
