Bell inequality for arbitrary many settings of the analyzers
A generalization of the CHSH-Bell inequality to arbitrary many settings is
presented. The singlet state of two spin $\half$ violates this inequality for
all numbers of setting. In the limit of arbitrarily large number of settings,
the violation tends to the finite ratio $4/\pi \approx 1.27$.
