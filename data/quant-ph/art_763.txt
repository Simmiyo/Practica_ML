Entropy and optimal decompositions of states relative to a maximal
  commutative subalgebra
To calculate the entropy of a subalgebra or of a channel with respect to a
state, one has to solve an intriguing optimalization problem. The latter is
also the key part in the entanglement of formation concept, in which case the
subalgebra is a subfactor. I consider some general properties, valid for these
definitions in finite dimensions, and apply them to a maximal commutative
subalgebra of a full matrix algebra. The main method is an interplay between
convexity and symmetry. A collection of helpful tools from convex analysis for
the problems in question is collected in an appendix.
