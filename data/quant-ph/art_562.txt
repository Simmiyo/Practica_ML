Interferometry as a binary decision problem
Binary decision theory has been applied to the general interferometric
problem. Optimal detection scheme-according to the Neyman-Pearson criterion-has
been considered for different phase-enhanced states of radiation field, and the
corresponding bounds on minimum detectable phase shift has been evaluated. A
general bound on interferometric precision has been also obtained in terms of
photon number fluctuations of the signal mode carrying the phase information.
