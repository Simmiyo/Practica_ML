Relation between complementarity and nonlocality under decoherence
Relations connecting violation of any Bell inequalities and the
complementarity between visibility and distinguishability in the
interferometric experiments with different sources of decoherence are
presented. A boundary of local-realistic explanation of the which-way
complementarity is discussed in dependence on the choice of independent or
collective tests of nonlocality.
