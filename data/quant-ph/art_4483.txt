Optimum detection for extracting maximum information from symmetric
  qubit sets
We demonstrate a class of optimum detection strategies for extracting the
maximum information from sets of equiprobable real symmetric qubit states of a
single photon. These optimum strategies have been predicted by Sasaki et al.
[Phys. Rev. A{\bf 59}, 3325 (1999)]. The peculiar aspect is that the detections
with at least three outputs suffice for optimum extraction of information
regardless of the number of signal elements. The cases of ternary (or trine),
quinary, and septenary polarization signals are studied where a standard von
Neumann detection (a projection onto a binary orthogonal basis) fails to access
the maximum information. Our experiments demonstrate that it is possible with
present technologies to attain about 96% of the theoretical limit.
