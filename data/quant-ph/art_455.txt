Path Integral in Holomorphic Representation without Gauge Fixation
A method of path integral construction without gauge fixing in the
holomorphic representation is proposed for finite-dimensional gauge models.
This path integral determines a manifestly gauge-invariant kernel of the
evolution operator.
