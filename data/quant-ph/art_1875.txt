Experimental Realization of A Two Bit Phase Damping Quantum Code
Using nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, we experimentally investigated
the effects of applying a two bit phase error detection code to preserve
quantum information in nuclear spin systems. Input states were stored with and
without coding, and the resulting output states were compared with the
originals and with each other. The theoretically expected result, net reduction
of distortion and conditional error probabilities to second order, was indeed
observed, despite imperfect coding operations which increased the error
probabilities by approximately 5%. Systematic study of the deviations from the
ideal behavior provided quantitative measures of different sources of error,
and good agreement was found with a numerical model. Theoretical questions in
quantum error correction in bulk nuclear spin systems including fidelity
measures, signal strength and syndrome measurements are discussed.
