Local hidden-variable models and negative-probability measures
Elaborating on a previous work by Han et al., we give a general,
basis-independent proof of the necessity of negative probability measures in
order for a class of local hidden-variable (LHV) models to violate the
Bell-CHSH inequality. Moreover, we obtain general solutions for LHV-induced
probability measures that reproduce any consistent set of probabilities.
