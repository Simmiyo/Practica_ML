Entanglement-Enhanced Classical Communication on a Noisy Quantum Channel
We consider the problem of trying to send a single classical bit through a
noisy quantum channel when two transmissions through the channel are available
as a resource. Classically, two transmissions add nothing to the receiver's
capability of inferring the bit. In the quantum world, however, one has the
possible further advantage of entangling the two transmissions. We demonstrate
that, for certain noisy channels, such entangled transmissions enhance the
receiver's capability of a correct inference.
