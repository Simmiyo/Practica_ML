Exact Solution of a Class of Three-Body Scattering Problems in One
  dimension
We present an exact solution of the three-body scattering problem for a one
parameter family of one dimensional potentials containing the Calogero and
Wolfes potentials as special limiting cases. The result is an interesting
nontrivial relationship between the final momenta $p'_i$ and the initial
momenta $p_i$ of the three particles. We also discuss another one parameter
family of potentials for all of which $p'_i=-p_i~(i=1,2,3)$.
