Inverse problem and Darboux transformations for two-dimensional
  finite-difference Schredinger equation
A discrete version of the two-dimensional inverse scattering problem is
considered. On this basis, algebraic transformations for the two-dimensional
finite-difference Schredinger equation are elaborated.
