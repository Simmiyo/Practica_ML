Fokker-Planck and Langevin Equations from Forward--Backward Path
  Integral
Starting from a forward--backward path integral of a point particle in a bath
of harmonic oscillators, we derive the Fokker-Planck and Langevin equations
with and without inertia. Special emphasis is placed upon the correct operator
order in the time evolution operator. The crucial step is the evaluation of a
Jacobian with a retarded time derivative by analytic regularization.
