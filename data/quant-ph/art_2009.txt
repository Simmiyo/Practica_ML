Path Integral on Relativistic Spinless Potential Problems
The formulation of the relativistic spinless path integral on the general
affine space is presented. For the one dimensional space, the Duru-Kleinert
(DK) method and the $\delta $-function perturbation technique are applied to
solve the relativistic path integrals of the smooth potential and the Dirichlet
boundary condition problems, respectively.
