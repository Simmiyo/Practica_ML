Relativistic J-matrix method
The relativistic version of the J-matrix method for a scattering problem on
the potential vanishing faster than the Coulomb one is formulated. As in the
non-relativistic case it leads to a finite algebraic eigenvalue problem. The
derived expression for the tangent of phase shift is simply related to the
non-relativistic case formula and gives the latter as a limit case. It is due
to the fact that the used basis set satisfies the ``kinetic balance
condition''.
