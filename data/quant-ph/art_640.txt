Measure of Entaglement
The extent to which a given wave function, $\psi$, is entangled is measured
by minimizing the norm of $\psi$ minus all possible unentangled functions. This
measure is given by the largest eigenvalue of $\psi^\dagger \psi$, considered
as an operator. The definition is basis independent.
