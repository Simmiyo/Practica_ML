Bell inequality and the locality loophole: Active versus passive
  switches
All experimental tests of the violation of Bell's inequality suffer from some
loopholes. We show that the locality loophole is not independent of the
detection loophole: in experiments using low efficient detectors, the locality
loophole can be closed equivalently using active or passive switches.
