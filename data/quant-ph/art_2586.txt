Higher-Power Coherent and Squeezed States
A closed form expression for the higher-power coherent states (eigenstates of
$a^{j}$) is given. The cases j=3,4 are discussed in detail, including the
time-evolution of the probability densities. These are compared to the case
j=2, the even- and odd-coherent states. We give the extensions to the
"effective" displacement-operator, higher-power squeezed states and to the
ladder-operator/minimum-uncertainty, higher-power squeezed states. The
properties of all these states are discussed.
