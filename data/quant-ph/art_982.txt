How to visualize a quantum transition of a single atom
The previously proposed visualization of Rabi oscillations of a single atom
by a continuous fuzzy measurement of energy is specified for the case of a
single transition between levels caused by a $\pi$-pulse of a driving field. An
analysis in the framework of the restricted-path-integral approach (which
reduces effectively to a Schr\"odinger equation with a complex Hamiltonian)
shows that the measurement gives a reliable information about the system
evolution, but the probability of the transition becomes less than unity. In
addition an experimental setup is proposed for continuous monitoring the state
of an atom by observation of electrons scattered by it. It is shown how this
setup realizes a continuous fuzzy measurement of the atom energy.
