Reconstruction of quantum states of spin systems via the Jaynes
  principle of maximum entropy
We apply the Jaynes principle of maximum entropy for the partial
reconstruction of correlated spin states. We determine the minimum set of
observables which are necessary for the complete reconstruction of the most
correlated states of systems composed of spins-1/2 (e.g., the Bell and the
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states). We investigate to what extent an
incomplete measurement can reveal nonclassical features of correlated spin
states.
