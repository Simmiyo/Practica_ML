Phase shift operator and cyclic evolution in finite dimensional Hilbert
  space
We address the problem of phase shift operator acting as time evolution
operator in Pegg-Barnett formalism. It is argued that standard shift operator
is inconsistent with the behaviour of the state vector under cyclic evolution.
We consider a generally deformed oscillator algebra at q-root of unity, as it
yields the same Pegg-Barnett operator and show that shift operator meets our
requirement.
