Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices
This paper investigates a variety of unconventional quantum computation
devices, including fermionic quantum computers and computers that exploit
nonlinear quantum mechanics. It is shown that unconventional quantum computing
devices can in principle compute some quantities more rapidly than
`conventional' quantum computers.
