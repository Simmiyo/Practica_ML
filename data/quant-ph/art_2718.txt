Distillability and partial transposition in bipartite systems
We study the distillability of a certain class of bipartite density operators
which can be obtained via depolarization starting from an arbitrary one. Our
results suggest that non-positivity of the partial transpose of a density
operator is not a sufficient condition for distillability, when the dimension
of both subsystems is higher than two.
