Unitary transformation approach for the trapped ion dynamics
We present a way of treating the problem of the interaction of a single
trapped ion with laser beams based on successive aplications of unitary
transformations onto the Hamiltonian. This allows the diagonalization of the
Hamiltonian, by means of recursive relations, without performing the Lamb-Dicke
approximation.
