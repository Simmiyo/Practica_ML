Heating and decoherence suppression using decoupling techniques
We study the application of decoupling techniques to the case of a damped
vibrational mode of a chain of trapped ions, which can be used as a quantum bus
in linear ion trap quantum computers. We show that vibrational heating could be
efficiently suppressed using appropriate ``parity kicks''. We also show that
vibrational decoherence can be suppressed by this decoupling procedure, even
though this is generally more difficult because the rate at which the parity
kicks have to applied increases with the effective bath temperature.
