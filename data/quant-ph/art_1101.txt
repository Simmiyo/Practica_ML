On the effectiveness of Gamow's method for calculating decay rates
We examine Gamow's method for calculating the decay rate of a wave function
initially located within a potential well. Using elementary techniques, we
examine a very simple, exactly solvable model, in order to show why it is so
reliable for calculating decay rates, in spite of its conceptual problems. We
also discuss the regime of validity of the exponential decay law.
