Quantum equivalent of the Bertrand's theorem
A procedure for constructing bound state potentials is given. We show that,
under the natural conditions imposed on a radial eigenvalue problem, the only
special cases of the general central potential, which are exactly solvable and
have infinite number of energy eigenvalues, are the Coulomb and harmonic
oscillator potentials.
