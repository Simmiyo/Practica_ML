Observation of radiation pressure exerted by evanescent waves
We report a direct observation of radiation pressure, exerted on cold
rubidium atoms while bouncing on an evanescent-wave atom mirror. We analyze the
radiation pressure by imaging the motion of the atoms after the bounce. The
number of absorbed photons is measured for laser detunings ranging from {190
MHz} to {1.4 GHz} and for angles from {0.9 mrad} to {24 mrad} above the
critical angle of total internal reflection. Depending on these settings, we
find velocity changes parallel with the mirror surface, ranging from 1 to {18
cm/s}. This corresponds to 2 to 31 photon recoils per atom. These results are
independent of the evanescent-wave optical power.
