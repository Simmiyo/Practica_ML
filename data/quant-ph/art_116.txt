Holstein-Primakoff/Bogoliubov Transformations and the Multiboson System
As an aid to understanding the {\it displacement operator} definition of
squeezed states for arbitrary systems, we investigate the properties of systems
where there is a Holstein-Primakoff or Bogoliubov transformation. In these
cases the {\it ladder-operator or minimum-uncertainty} definitions of squeezed
states are equivalent to an extent displacement-operator definition. We
exemplify this in a setting where there are operators satisfying $[A,
A^{\dagger}] = 1$, but the $A$'s are not necessarily the Fock space $a$'s; the
multiboson system. It has been previously observed that the ground state of a
system often can be shown to to be a coherent state. We demonstrate why this
must be so. We close with a discussion of an alternative, effective definition
of displacement-operator squeezed states.
