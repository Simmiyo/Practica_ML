Discrete path integral for spin-1/2 in the Grassmannian representation
A variation to the usual formulation of Grassmann representation path
integrals is presented. Time-indexed anticommuting partners are introduced for
each Grassmann coherent state variable and a general method for handling the
effect of these introduced Grassmann partners is also developed. These
Grassmann partners carry the nilpotency and anticommutivity of the Grassmann
coherent state variables into the propagator and allow the propagator to be
written as a path integral. Two examples are introduced in which this variation
is shown to yield exact results. In particular, exact results are
demonstratated for a spin-1/2 in a time-dependent magnetic field, and for a
spin-boson system. The stationary path approximation is then shown to be exact
for each example.
