Modeling the Singlet State with Local Variables
A local-variable model yielding the statistics from the singlet state is
presented for the case of inefficient detectors and/or lowered visibility. It
has independent errors and the highest efficiency at perfect visibility is
77.80%, while the highest visibility at perfect detector-efficiency is 63.66%.
Thus, the model cannot be refuted by measurements made to date.
