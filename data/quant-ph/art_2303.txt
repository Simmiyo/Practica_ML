Fundamental Limit on ``Interaction Free'' Measurements
In ``interaction free'' measurements, one typically wants to detect the
presence of an object without touching it with even a single photon. One often
imagines a bomb whose trigger is an extremely sensitive measuring device whose
presence we would like to detect without triggering it. We point out that all
such measuring devices have a maximum sensitivity set by the uncertainty
principle, and thus can only determine whether a measurement is ``interaction
free'' to within a finite minimum resolution. We further discuss exactly what
can be achieved with the proposed ``interaction free'' measurement schemes.
