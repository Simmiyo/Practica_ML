Coherent States for the Hydrogen Atom
The long-standing problem of finding coherent states for the (bound state
portion of the) hydrogen atom is positively resolved. The states in question:
(i) are normalized and are parameterized continuously, (ii) admit a resolution
of unity with a positive measure, and (iii) enjoy the property that the
temporal evolution of any coherent state by the hydrogen atom Hamiltonian
remains a coherent state for all time.
