Prescription for experimental determination of the dynamics of a quantum
  black box
We give an explicit prescription for experimentally determining the evolution
operators which completely describe the dynamics of a quantum mechanical black
box -- an arbitrary open quantum system. We show necessary and sufficient
conditions for this to be possible, and illustrate the general theory by
considering specifically one and two quantum bit systems. These procedures may
be useful in the comparative evaluation of experimental quantum measurement,
communication, and computation systems.
