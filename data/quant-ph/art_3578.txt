Thresholds for Linear Optics Quantum Computation
We previously established that in principle, it is possible to quantum
compute using passive linear optics with photo-detectors (quant-ph/0006088).
Here we describe techniques based on error detection and correction that
greatly improve the resource and device reliability requirements needed for
scalability. The resource requirements are analyzed for ideal linear optics
quantum computation (LOQC). The coding methods can be integrated both with loss
detection and phase error-correction to deal with the primary relaxation
processes in non-ideal optics, including detector inefficiencies. The main
conclusion of our work is that the resource requirements for implementing
quantum communication or computation with LOQC are reasonable. Furthermore,
this work clearly demonstrates how special knowledge of the error behavior can
be exploited for greatly improving the fault tolerance and overheads of a
physical quantum computer.
