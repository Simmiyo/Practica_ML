Molecular-Coherent-States and Molecular-Fundamental-States
New families of Molecular-Coherent-States are constructed by the Perelomov
group-method. Each family is generated by a Molecular-Fundamental-State that
depends on an arbitrary sequence of complex numbers cj. Two of these families
were already obtained by D.Janssen and by J. A. Morales, E. Deumens and Y.
Ohrn. The properties of these families are investigated and we show that most
of them are independent on the cj.
