Fast Quantum Fourier Transforms for a Class of Non-abelian Groups
An algorithm is presented allowing the construction of fast Fourier
transforms for any solvable group on a classical computer. The special
structure of the recursion formula being the core of this algorithm makes it a
good starting point to obtain systematically fast Fourier transforms for
solvable groups on a quantum computer. The inherent structure of the Hilbert
space imposed by the qubit architecture suggests to consider groups of order
2^n first (where n is the number of qubits). As an example, fast quantum
Fourier transforms for all 4 classes of non-abelian 2-groups with cyclic normal
subgroup of index 2 are explicitly constructed in terms of quantum circuits.
The (quantum) complexity of the Fourier transform for these groups of size 2^n
is O(n^2) in all cases.
