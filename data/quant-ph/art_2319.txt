Spontaneous emission between an unusual pair of plates
We compute the modification in the spontaneous emission rate for a two-level
atom when it is located between two parallel plates of different nature: a
perfectly conducting plate $(\epsilon\to \infty)$ and an infinitely permeable
one $(\mu\to \infty)$. We also discuss the case of two infinitely permeable
plates. We compare our results with those found in the literature for the case
of two perfectly conducting plates.
