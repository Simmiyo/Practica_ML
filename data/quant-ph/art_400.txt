Algebraic Formulation of the Operatorial Perturbation Theory. Part I
A new totally algebraic formalism based on general, abstract ladder operators
has been proposed. This approach heavily grounds in the superoperator formalism
of Primas. However it is necessary to introduce many improvements in his
formalism. In this regard, it has been introduced a new set of superoperators
featured by their algebraic structure. Also, two lemmas and one theorem have
been developed in order to algebraically reformulate the theory on more
rigorous grounds. Finally, we have been able to build a coherent and
self-contained formalism independent on any matricial representation , removing
in this way the degeneracy problem .
