Atomic entanglement near a realistic microsphere
We study a scheme for entangling two-level atoms located close to the surface
of a dielectric microsphere. The effect is based on medium-assisted spontaneous
decay, rigorously taking into account dispersive and absorptive properties of
the microsphere. We show that even in the weak-coupling regime, where the
Markov approximation applies, entanglement up to 0.35 ebits between two atoms
can be created. However, larger entanglement and violation of Bell's inequality
can only be achieved in the strong-coupling regime.
