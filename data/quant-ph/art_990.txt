Jaynes principle versus entanglement
We show, by explicit examples, that the Jaynes inference scheme based on
maximization of entropy can produce inseparable states even if there exists a
separable state compatible with the measured data. It can lead to problems with
processing of entanglement. The difficulty vanishes when one uses inference
scheme based on minimization of entanglement.
