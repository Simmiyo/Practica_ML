Non-Markovian quantum feedback from homodyne measurements: the effect of
  a non-zero feedback delay time
We solve exactly the non-Markovian dynamics of a cavity mode in the presence
of a feedback loop based on homodyne measurements, in the case of a non-zero
feedback delay time. With an appropriate choice of the feedback parameters,
this scheme is able to significantly increase the decoherence time of the
cavity mode, even for delay times not much smaller than the decoherence time
itself.
