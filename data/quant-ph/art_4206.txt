Propagation of Raman-matched laser pulses through a Bose-Einstein
  condensate
We investigate the role of non-uniform spatial density profiles of trapped
atomic Bose-Einstein condensates in the propagation of Raman-matched laser
pulses under conditions for electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). We
find that the sharp edged axial density profile of an interacting condensate
(due to a balance between external trap and repulsive atomic interaction) is
advantageous for obtaining ultra slow averaged group velocities. Our results
are in good quantitative agreement with a recent experiment report [Nature {\bf
397}, 594 (1999)].
