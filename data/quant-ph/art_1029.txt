The WKB Approximation without Divergences
In this paper, the WKB approximation to the scattering problem is developed
without the divergences which usually appear at the classical turning points. A
detailed procedure of complexification is shown to generate results identical
to the usual WKB prescription but without the cumbersome connection formulas.
