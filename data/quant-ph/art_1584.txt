Entanglement Induced Radiation Processes Which are First Order in Weak
  Field
Nonlinear processes of light scattering on a two-level system near resonance
are considered. The problem is reduced to the emission and absorption of an
entangled system, formed by a strong resonant field and a two-level system,
having a non-factorizing wave function.
