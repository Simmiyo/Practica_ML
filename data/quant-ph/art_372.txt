Perturbative Scattering Phase Shifts in One-Dimension: Closed-form
  Results
A simple closed form expression is obtained for the scattering phase shift
perturbatively to any given order in effective one-dimensional problems. The
result is a hierarchical scheme, expressible in quadratures, requiring only
knowledge of the zeroth order solution and the perturbation potential.
