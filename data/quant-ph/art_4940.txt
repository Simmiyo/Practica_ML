The EPR correlations and the chameleon effect
We describe an experiment in which two non communicating computers, starting
from a common input in the form of sequences of pseudo--random numbers in the
interval $[0,2\pi]$, and computing deterministic $\{\pm 1\}$--valued functions,
chosen at random and independently, produce sequences of numbers whose
correlations coincide with the EPR correlations and therefore violate Bell's
inequality.
  The experiment is the practical implementation of a mathematical model of a
classical, deterministic system whose initial state is chosen at random from
its state space, with a known initial probability distribution, and whose
dynamics exhibits the chameleon effect described below. Such a system satisfies
the constraints of pre--determination, locality, causality, local independent
choices, singlet law and reproduces the EPR correlations.
