Biased EPR entanglement and its application to teleportation
We consider pure continuous variable entanglement with non-equal correlations
between orthogonal quadratures. We introduce a simple protocol which equates
these correlations and in the process transforms the entanglement onto a state
with the minimum allowed number of photons. As an example we show that our
protocol transforms, through unitary local operations, a single squeezed beam
split on a beam splitter into the same entanglement that is produced when two
squeezed beams are mixed orthogonally. We demonstrate that this technique can
in principle facilitate perfect teleportation utilising only one squeezed beam.
