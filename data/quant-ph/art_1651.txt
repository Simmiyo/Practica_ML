Higgs Field and Localization Problem
We analyze the role that the excited states of the Higgs field could play in
a possible solution to the so called localization problem of Quantum Theory. We
seek a solution to the aforementioned point without introducing additional
fundamental constants or extra hypotheses, as has been done in previous works.
  The electron and Higgs field do indeed have solitonic solutions. This last
feature renders, in the one-dimensional case, a solution to the localization
problem.
