Non dissipative decoherence of Rabi oscillations
We present a simple theoretical description of two recent experiments where
damping of Rabi oscillations, which cannot be attributed to dissipative
decoherence, has been observed. This is obtained considering the evolution time
or the Hamiltonian as random variables and then averaging the usual unitary
evolution on a properly defined, model-independent, probability distribution.
