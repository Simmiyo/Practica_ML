Lie Symmetry, discrete symmetry and supersymmetry of the Pauli
  Hamiltonian
Starting from the full group of symmetries of a system we select a discrete
subset of transformations which allows to introduce the Clifford algebra of
operators generating new supercharges of extended supersymmetry. The system
defined by the Pauli Hamiltonian is discussed.
