Limitations of Noisy Reversible Computation
Noisy computation and reversible computation have been studied separately,
and it is known that they are as powerful as unrestricted computation. We study
the case where both noise and reversibility are combined and show that the
combined model is weaker than unrestricted computation. In our noisy reversible
circuits, each wire is flipped with probability p each time step, and all the
inputs to the circuit are present in time 0. We prove that any noisy reversible
circuit must have size exponential in its depth in order to compute a function
with high probability. This is tight as we show that any circuit can be
converted into a noise-resistant reversible one with a blow up in size which is
exponential in the depth. This establishes that noisy reversible computation
has the power of the complexity class NC^1.
  We extend this to quantum circuits(QC). We prove that any noisy QC which is
not worthless, and for which all inputs are present at time 0, must have size
exponential in its depth. (This high-lights the fact that fault tolerant QC
must use a constant supply of inputs all the time.) For the lower bound, we
show that quasi-polynomial noisy QC are at least powerful as logarithmic depth
QC, (or QNC^1). Making these bounds tight is left open in the quantum case.
