Bohmian Mechanics Revisited
We consider the problem of whether there are deterministic theories
describing the evolution of an individual physical system in terms of the
definite trajectories of its constituent particles and which stay in the same
relation to Quantum Mechanics as Bohmian Mechanics but which differ from the
latter for what concerns the trajectories followed by the particles. Obviously,
one has to impose on the hypothetical alternative theory precise physical
requirements. We analyse various such constraints and we show step by step how
to meet them. This way of attacking the problem allows to recall and focus on
some relevant features of Bohm's theory. One of the central requirements we
impose on the models we are going to analyse has to do with their
transformation properties under the transformations of the extended Galilei
group. In a context like the one we are interested in one can put forward
various requests that we refer to as physical and genuine covariance and
invariance. Other fundamental requests are that the theory allows the
description of isolated physical systems as well as that it leads to a solution
(in the same sense as Bohmian Mechanics) of the measurement problem. We show
that there are infinitely many inequivalent (from the point of view of the
trajectories) bohmian-like theories reproducing the predictions of Quantum
Mechanics.
