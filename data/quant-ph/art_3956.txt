Beyond Stabilizer Codes II: Clifford Codes
Knill introduced a generalization of stabilizer codes, in this note called
Clifford codes. It remained unclear whether or not Clifford codes can be
superior to stabilizer codes. We show that Clifford codes are stabilizer codes
provided that the abstract error group has an abelian index group. In
particular, if the errors are modelled by tensor products of Pauli matrices,
then the associated Clifford codes are necessarily stabilizer codes.
