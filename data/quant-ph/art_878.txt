Effective Pure States for Bulk Quantum Computation
In bulk quantum computation one can manipulate a large number of
indistinguishable quantum computers by parallel unitary operations and measure
expectation values of certain observables with limited sensitivity. The initial
state of each computer in the ensemble is known but not pure. Methods for
obtaining effective pure input states by a series of manipulations have been
described by Gershenfeld and Chuang (logical labeling) and Cory et al. (spatial
averaging) for the case of quantum computation with nuclear magnetic resonance.
We give a different technique called temporal averaging. This method is based
on classical randomization, requires no ancilla qubits and can be implemented
in nuclear magnetic resonance without using gradient fields. We introduce
several temporal averaging algorithms suitable for both high temperature and
low temperature bulk quantum computing and analyze the signal to noise behavior
of each.
