A new orthogonalization procedure with an extremal property
Various methods of constructing an orthonomal set out of a given set of
linearly independent vectors are discussed. Particular attention is paid to the
Gram-Schmidt and the Schweinler-Wigner orthogonalization procedures. A new
orthogonalization procedure which, like the Schweinler- Wigner procedure, is
democratic and is endowed with an extremal property is suggested.
