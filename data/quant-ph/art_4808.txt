Simulating Hamiltonians in Quantum Networks: Efficient Schemes and
  Complexity Bounds
We address the problem of simulating pair-interaction Hamiltonians in n node
quantum networks where the subsystems have arbitrary, possibly different,
dimensions. We show that any pair-interaction can be used to simulate any other
by applying sequences of appropriate local control sequences. Efficient schemes
for decoupling and time reversal can be constructed from orthogonal arrays.
Conditions on time optimal simulation are formulated in terms of spectral
majorization of matrices characterizing the coupling parameters. Moreover, we
consider a specific system of n harmonic oscillators with bilinear interaction.
In this case, decoupling can efficiently be achieved using the combinatorial
concept of difference schemes. For this type of interactions we present optimal
schemes for inversion.
