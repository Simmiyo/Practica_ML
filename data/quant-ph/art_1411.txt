Bell inequality, Bell states and maximally entangled states for n qubits
First, we present a Bell type inequality for n qubits, assuming that m out of
the n qubits are independent. Quantum mechanics violates this inequality by a
ratio that increases exponentially with m. Hence an experiment on n qubits
violating of this inequality sets a lower bound on the number m of entangled
qubits. Next, we propose a definition of maximally entangled states of n
qubits. For this purpose we study 5 different criteria. Four of these criteria
are found compatible. For any number n of qubits, they determine an orthogonal
basis consisting of maximally entangled states generalizing the Bell states.
