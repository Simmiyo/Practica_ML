Path Integral Evaluation of the Free Propagator on the (D-1)-dimensional
  Pseudosphere
We present an explicit path integral evaluation of the free Hamiltonian
propagator on the (D-1)-dimensional pseudosphere, in the horicyclic
coordinates, using the integral equation method. This method consists in
deriving an integral equation for the propagator that turns out to be of Abel's
type.
