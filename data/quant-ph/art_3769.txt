Lateral projection as a possible explanation of the nontrivial boundary
  dependence of the Casimir force
We find the lateral projection of the Casimir force for a configuration of a
sphere above a corrugated plate. This force tends to change the sphere position
in the direction of a nearest corrugation maximum. The probability distribution
describing different positions of a sphere above a corrugated plate is
suggested which is fitted well with experimental data demonstrating the
nontrivial boundary dependence of the Casimir force.
