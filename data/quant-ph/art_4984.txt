Quantifying entanglement with probabilities
We propose a new approach to the problem of defining the degree of
entanglement between two particles in a pure state with Hilbert spaces of
arbitrary finite dimensions. The central idea is that entanglement gives rise
to correlations between the particles that do not occur in separable states. We
individuate the contributions of these correlations to the joint and the
conditional probabilities of local measurements outcomes. We use these
probabilities to define the measure of entanglement. Our measure turns out to
be proportional to the so-called 2-entropy and therefore satisfies the
properties required for any measure of entanglement. We conclude with an
outlook on the problem of extending our approach to the case of multipartite
systems and mixed states.
