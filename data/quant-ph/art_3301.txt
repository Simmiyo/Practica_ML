Multipartite pure-state entanglement and the generalized GHZ states
We show that not all 4-party pure states are GHZ reducible (i.e., can be
generated reversibly from a combination of 2-, 3- and 4-party maximally
entangled states by local quantum operations and classical communication
asymptotically) through an example, we also present some properties of the
relative entropy of entanglement for those 3-party pure states that are GHZ
reducible, and then we relate these properties to the additivity of the
relative entropy of entanglement.
