Teleportation of Entangled States of a Vacuum-One Photon Qubit
We report the experimental realization of teleporting an entangled qubit. The
qubit is physically implemented by a two-dimensional subspace of states of a
mode of the electromagnetic field, specifically, the space spanned by the
vacuum and the one photon state. Our experiment follows along lines suggested
by H. W. Lee and J. Kim, Phys. Rev. A, 63, 012305 (2000) and E.Knill,
R.Laflamme and G.Milburn Nature 409: 46 (2001).
