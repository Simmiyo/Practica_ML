Dipole Emission In Finite Photonic Band-Gap Structures: an Exactly
  Solvable One-Dimensional Model
I consider an exact model of atomic spontaneous dipole emission and classical
dipole radiation in a finite photonic band-gap structure. The full 3D or 2D
problem is reduced to a finite 1D model, and then this is solved for
analytically using algebraic matrix transfer techniques. The results give
insight to the electromagnetic emission process in periodic dielectrics,
quantitative predictions for emission in 1D dielectric stacks, and qualitative
formulas for the 2D and 3D problem.
