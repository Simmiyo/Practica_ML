Efficient supervised learning in networks with binary synapses
Recent experimental studies indicate that synaptic changes induced by
neuronal activity are discrete jumps between a small number of stable states.
Learning in systems with discrete synapses is known to be a computationally
hard problem. Here, we study a neurobiologically plausible on-line learning
algorithm that derives from Belief Propagation algorithms. We show that it
performs remarkably well in a model neuron with binary synapses, and a finite
number of `hidden' states per synapse, that has to learn a random
classification task. Such system is able to learn a number of associations
close to the theoretical limit, in time which is sublinear in system size. This
is to our knowledge the first on-line algorithm that is able to achieve
efficiently a finite number of patterns learned per binary synapse.
Furthermore, we show that performance is optimal for a finite number of hidden
states which becomes very small for sparse coding. The algorithm is similar to
the standard `perceptron' learning algorithm, with an additional rule for
synaptic transitions which occur only if a currently presented pattern is
`barely correct'. In this case, the synaptic changes are meta-plastic only
(change in hidden states and not in actual synaptic state), stabilizing the
synapse in its current state. Finally, we show that a system with two visible
states and K hidden states is much more robust to noise than a system with K
visible states. We suggest this rule is sufficiently simple to be easily
implemented by neurobiological systems or in hardware.
