Codimension Two Bifurcations and Rythms in Neural Mass Models
Temporal lobe epilepsy is one of the most common chronic neurological
disorder characterized by the occurrence of spontaneous recurrent seizures
which can be observed at the level of populations through electroencephalogram
(EEG) recordings. This paper summarizes some preliminary works aimed to
understand from a theoretical viewpoint the occurrence of this type of seizures
and the origin of the oscillatory activity in some classical cortical column
models. We relate these rhythmic activities to the structure of the set of
periodic orbits in the models, and therefore to their bifurcations. We will be
mainly interested Jansen and Rit model, and study the codimension one, two and
a codimension three bifurcations of equilibria and cycles of this model. We can
therefore understand the effect of the different biological parameters of the
system of the apparition of epileptiform activity and observe the emergence of
alpha, delta and theta sleep waves in a certain range of parameter. We then
present a very quick study of Wendling and Chauvel's model which takes into
account GABA A inhibitory postsynaptic currents.
