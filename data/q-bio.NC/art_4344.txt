Advanced Mean Field Theory of Restricted Boltzmann Machine
Learning in restricted Boltzmann machine is typically hard due to the
computation of gradients of log-likelihood function. To describe the network
state statistics of the restricted Boltzmann machine, we develop an advanced
mean field theory based on the Bethe approximation. Our theory provides an
efficient message passing based method that evaluates not only the partition
function (free energy) but also its gradients without requiring statistical
sampling. The results are compared with those obtained by the computationally
expensive sampling based method.
