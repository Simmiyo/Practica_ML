Connectome graphs and maximum flow problems
We propose to study maximum flow problems for connectome graphs. We suggest a
few computational problems: finding vertex pairs with maximal flow, finding new
edges which would increase the maximal flow. Initial computation results for
some publicly available connectome graphs are described.
