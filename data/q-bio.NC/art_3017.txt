A short review and primer on electroencephalography in human computer
  interaction applications
The application of psychophysiology in human-computer interaction is a
growing field with significant potential for future smart personalised systems.
Working in this emerging field requires comprehension of an array of
physiological signals and analysis techniques.
  Methods to study central nervous system (CNS) are usually expensive and
laborious. However, electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the most affordable
and ambulatory methodologies for CNS research. It is in use in various clinical
studies and have been broadly studied over decades. Despite that the recorded
EEG signals are quite prone to noise and environmental factors it is the most
widely used method in study of brain-computer interaction (BCI). Here we
discuss briefly on various aspects of the recorded signals, their
interpretation, and usage in the field of interaction studies.
  This paper aims to serve as a primer for the novice, enabling rapid
familiarisation with the latest core concepts. We put special emphasis on
everyday human-computer interface applications to distinguish from the more
common clinical or sports uses of psychophysiology.
  This paper is an extract from a comprehensive review of the entire field of
ambulatory psychophysiology, including 12 similar chapters, plus application
guidelines and systematic review. Thus any citation should be made using the
