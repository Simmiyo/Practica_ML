ATP Hysteresis in Tripartite Synapses
Recent experimental studies strongly suggest the influence of glial
purinergic transmission in the modulation of synaptic dynamics. By releasing
adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which accumulates as adenosine, astrocytes
tonically suppressed synaptic transmission. The delayed multi-step feedback of
the glial adenosine with the neuron suggest the existence of hysteresis
phenomena, which are investigated in the present study from the theoretical
point of view. The model suggests that a memory operator, tripartite synaptic
plasticity, governs the mysterious delayed feedback inhibition caused by the
action of adenosine on neuronal $A_1$ receptors and provides a powerful tool
for further dynamical modeling tasks on tripartite synapses.
