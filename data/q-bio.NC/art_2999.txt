Multimodal Brain Visualization
Current connectivity diagrams of human brain image data are either overly
complex or overly simplistic. In this work we introduce simple yet accurate
interactive visual representations of multiple brain image structures and the
connectivity among them. We map cortical surfaces extracted from human brain
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data onto 2D surfaces that preserve shape
(angle), extent (area), and spatial (neighborhood) information for 2D (circular
disk) and 3D (spherical) mapping, split these surfaces into separate patches,
and cluster functional and diffusion tractography MRI connections between pairs
of these patches. The resulting visualizations are easier to compute on and
more visually intuitive to interact with than the original data, and facilitate
simultaneous exploration of multiple data sets, modalities, and statistical
maps.
