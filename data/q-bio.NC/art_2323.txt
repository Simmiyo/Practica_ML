Generating functionals for autonomous latching dynamics in attractor
  relict networks
Well characterized sequences of dynamical states play an important role for
motor control and associative neural computation in the brain. Autonomous
dynamics involving sequences of transiently stable states have been termed
associative latching in the context of grammar generation. We propose that
generating functionals allow for a systematic construction of dynamical
networks with well characterized dynamical behavior, such as regular or
intermittent bursting latching dynamics.
  Coupling local, slowly adapting variables to an attractor network allows to
destabilize all attractors, turning them into attractor ruins. The resulting
attractor relict network may show ongoing autonomous latching dynamics. We
propose to use two generating functionals for the construction of attractor
relict networks. The first functional is a simple Hopfield energy functional,
known to generate a neural attractor network. The second generating functional,
which we denote polyhomeostatic optimization, is based on
information-theoretical principles, encoding the information content of the
neural firing statistics. Polyhomeostatic optimization destabilizes the
attractors of the Hopfield network inducing latching dynamics.
  We investigate the influence of stress, in terms of conflicting optimization
targets, on the resulting dynamics. Objective function stress is absent when
the target level for the mean of neural activities is identical for the two
generating functionals and the resulting latching dynamics is then found to be
regular. Objective function stress is present when the respective target
activity levels differ, inducing intermittent bursting latching dynamics. We
propose that generating functionals may be useful quite generally for the
controlled construction of complex dynamical systems.
