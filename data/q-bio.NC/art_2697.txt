Neuron detection in stack images: a persistent homology interpretation
Automation and reliability are the two main requirements when computers are
applied in Life Sciences. In this paper we report on an application to neuron
recognition, an important step in our long-term project of providing software
systems to the study of neural morphology and functionality from biomedical
images. Our algorithms have been implemented in an ImageJ plugin called
NeuronPersistentJ, which has been validated experimentally. The soundness and
reliability of our approach are based on the interpretation of our processing
methods with respect to persistent homology, a well-known tool in computational
mathematics.
