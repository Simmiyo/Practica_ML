The infochemical core
Vocalizations and less often gestures have been the object of linguistic
research over decades. However, the development of a general theory of
communication with human language as a particular case requires a clear
understanding of the organization of communication through other means.
Infochemicals are chemical compounds that carry information and are employed by
small organisms that cannot emit acoustic signals of optimal frequency to
achieve successful communication. Here the distribution of infochemicals across
species is investigated when they are ranked by their degree or the number of
species with which it is associated (because they produce or they are sensitive
to it). The quality of the fit of different functions to the dependency between
degree and rank is evaluated with a penalty for the number of parameters of the
function. Surprisingly, a double Zipf (a Zipf distribution with two regimes
with a different exponent each) is the model yielding the best fit although it
is the function with the largest number of parameters. This suggests that the
world wide repertoire of infochemicals contains a chemical nucleus shared by
many species and reminiscent of the core vocabularies found for human language
in dictionaries or large corpora.
