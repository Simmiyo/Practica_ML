Why is language well-designed for communication? (Commentary on
  Christiansen and Chater: 'Language as shaped by the brain')
Selection through iterated learning explains no more than other
non-functional accounts, such as universal grammar, why language is so
well-designed for communicative efficiency. It does not predict several
distinctive features of language like central embedding, large lexicons or the
lack of iconicity, that seem to serve communication purposes at the expense of
learnability.
