Time-causal and time-recursive spatio-temporal receptive fields
We present an improved model and theory for time-causal and time-recursive
spatio-temporal receptive fields, based on a combination of Gaussian receptive
fields over the spatial domain and first-order integrators or equivalently
truncated exponential filters coupled in cascade over the temporal domain.
  Compared to previous spatio-temporal scale-space formulations in terms of
non-enhancement of local extrema or scale invariance, these receptive fields
are based on different scale-space axiomatics over time by ensuring
non-creation of new local extrema or zero-crossings with increasing temporal
scale. Specifically, extensions are presented about (i) parameterizing the
intermediate temporal scale levels, (ii) analysing the resulting temporal
dynamics, (iii) transferring the theory to a discrete implementation, (iv)
computing scale-normalized spatio-temporal derivative expressions for
spatio-temporal feature detection and (v) computational modelling of receptive
fields in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the primary visual cortex
(V1) in biological vision.
  We show that by distributing the intermediate temporal scale levels according
to a logarithmic distribution, we obtain much faster temporal response
properties (shorter temporal delays) compared to a uniform distribution.
Specifically, these kernels converge very rapidly to a limit kernel possessing
true self-similar scale-invariant properties over temporal scales, thereby
allowing for true scale invariance over variations in the temporal scale,
although the underlying temporal scale-space representation is based on a
discretized temporal scale parameter.
  We show how scale-normalized temporal derivatives can be defined for these
time-causal scale-space kernels and how the composed theory can be used for
computing basic types of scale-normalized spatio-temporal derivative
expressions in a computationally efficient manner.
