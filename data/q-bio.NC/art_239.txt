Neuronal Response Clamp
Since the first recordings made of evoked action potentials it has become
apparent that the responses of individual neurons to ongoing physiologically
relevant input, are highly variable. This variability is manifested in
non-stationary behavior of practically every observable neuronal response
feature. Here we introduce the Neuronal Response Clamp, a closed-loop technique
enabling full control over two important single neuron activity variables:
response probability and stimulus-spike latency. The technique is applicable
over extended durations (up to several hours), and is effective even on the
background of ongoing neuronal network activity. The Response Clamp technique
is a powerful tool, extending the voltage-clamp and dynamic-clamp approaches to
the neuron's functional level, namely - its spiking behavior.
