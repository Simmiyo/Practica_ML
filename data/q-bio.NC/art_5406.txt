Nonnegative Decomposition of Multivariate Information
Of the various attempts to generalize information theory to multiple
variables, the most widely utilized, interaction information, suffers from the
problem that it is sometimes negative. Here we reconsider from first principles
the general structure of the information that a set of sources provides about a
given variable. We begin with a new definition of redundancy as the minimum
information that any source provides about each possible outcome of the
variable, averaged over all possible outcomes. We then show how this measure of
redundancy induces a lattice over sets of sources that clarifies the general
structure of multivariate information. Finally, we use this redundancy lattice
to propose a definition of partial information atoms that exhaustively
decompose the Shannon information in a multivariate system in terms of the
redundancy between synergies of subsets of the sources. Unlike interaction
information, the atoms of our partial information decomposition are never
negative and always support a clear interpretation as informational quantities.
Our analysis also demonstrates how the negativity of interaction information
can be explained by its confounding of redundancy and synergy.
