White Matter Fiber Segmentation Using Functional Varifolds
The extraction of fibers from dMRI data typically produces a large number of
fibers, it is common to group fibers into bundles. To this end, many
specialized distance measures, such as MCP, have been used for fiber
similarity. However, these distance based approaches require point-wise
correspondence and focus only on the geometry of the fibers. Recent
publications have highlighted that using microstructure measures along fibers
improves tractography analysis. Also, many neurodegenerative diseases impacting
white matter require the study of microstructure measures as well as the white
matter geometry. Motivated by these, we propose to use a novel computational
model for fibers, called functional varifolds, characterized by a metric that
considers both the geometry and microstructure measure (e.g. GFA) along the
fiber pathway. We use it to cluster fibers with a dictionary learning and
sparse coding-based framework, and present a preliminary analysis using HCP
data.
