Coaching the Wii : evaluation of a physical training experiment assisted
  by a video game
Aging or sedentary behavior can decrease motor capabilities causing a loss of
autonomy. Prevention or readaptation programs that involve practice of physical
activities can be precious tools to fight against this phenomenon. ?Serious?
video game have the potential to help people to train their body mainly due to
the immersion of the participant in a motivating interaction with virtual
environments. We propose here to discuss the results of a preliminary study
that evaluated a training program using the well-known WiiFit game and Wii
balance board device in participants of different ages. Our results showed that
participants were satisfied with the program and that they progressed in their
level of performance. The most important observation of this study, however was
that the presence of a real human coach is necessary in particular for senior
participants, for security reasons but also to help them to deal with
difficulties with immersive situations.
