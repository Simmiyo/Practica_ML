Emission of Mitochondrial Biophotons and their Effect on Electrical
  Activity of Membrane via Microtubules
In this paper we argue that, in addition to electrical and chemical signals
propagating in the neurons of the brain, signal propagation takes place in the
form of biophoton production. This statement is supported by recent
experimental confirmation of photon guiding properties of a single neuron. We
have investigated the interaction of mitochondrial biophotons with microtubules
from a quantum mechanical point of view. Our theoretical analysis indicates
that the interaction of biophotons and microtubules causes
transitions/fluctuations of microtubules between coherent and incoherent
states. A significant relationship between the fluctuation function of
microtubules and alpha-EEG diagrams is elaborated on in this paper. We argue
that the role of biophotons in the brain merits special attention.
