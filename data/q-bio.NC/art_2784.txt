Identification of Intended Arm Movement Using Electrocorticographic
  Signals
A Brain Computer Interface (BCI) is a communication system that receives
neurological signals from the brain and translates them into control commands
for electrical (e.g., computer mouse) and electromechanical (e.g., Wheelchair)
devices. The development of such systems was intended originally to aid
individuals with a condition called locked-in syndrome. Individuals with this
condition have lost all their voluntary muscle control but remain cognitively
intact (i.e., mentally aware of their surroundings- can feel emotions,
recognize objects/people but are unable to move). This means that they are
trapped in their own bodies. The use of BCI may one day improve the
independence and quality of life of people with this disability.
