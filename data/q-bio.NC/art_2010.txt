Mental States as Macrostates Emerging from EEG Dynamics
Correlations between psychological and physiological phenomena form the basis
for different medical and scientific disciplines, but the nature of this
relation has not yet been fully understood. One conceptual option is to
understand the mental as "emerging" from neural processes in the specific sense
that psychology and physiology provide two different descriptions of the same
system. Stating these descriptions in terms of coarser- and finer-grained
system states (macro- and microstates), the two descriptions may be equally
adequate if the coarse-graining preserves the possibility to obtain a dynamical
rule for the system. To test the empirical viability of our approach, we
describe an algorithm to obtain a specific form of such a coarse-graining from
data, and illustrate its operation using a simulated dynamical system. We then
apply the method to an electroencephalographic (EEG) recording, where we are
able to identify macrostates from the physiological data that correspond to
mental states of the subject.
