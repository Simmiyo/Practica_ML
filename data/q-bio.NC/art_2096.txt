Development of input connections in neural cultures
We introduce a novel approach for the quantitative assessment of the
connectivity in neuronal cultures, based on the statistical mechanics of
percolation on a graph. This allows us to follow the development of the culture
and see the emergence of connectivity in the network. The culture becomes fully
connected at a time equivalent to full term. The spontaneous bursting activity
that characterizes cultures develops in parallel with the connectivity. The
average number of inputs per neuron can be quantitatively determined in units
of $m_0$, the number of activated inputs needed to excite the neuron. For
$m_0\sim 10$ we find that hippocampal neurons have on average $\sim 40-80$
inputs while cortical neurons have $\sim 50-100$, depending on neuronal
density. The ratio of excitatory to inhibitory neurons is determined using the
GABA$_\text{A}$ antagonist bicuculine. This ratio changes during development
and reaches the final value at day $7-8$, coinciding with the expected time of
the GABA switch. For hippocampal cultures the inhibitory cells comprise about
$30\%$ of the neurons in the culture while for cortical cultures they are about
$20\%$. Such detailed global information on the connectivity of networks in
neuronal cultures is at present inaccessible by any electrophysiological or
other technique.
