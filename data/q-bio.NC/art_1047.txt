A novel method linking neural connectivity to behavioral fluctuations:
  Behavior-Regressed Connectivity
Background: During an experimental session, behavioral performance
fluctuates, yet most neuroimaging analyses of functional connectivity derive a
single connectivity pattern. These conventional connectivity approaches assume
that since the underlying behavior of the task remains constant, the
connectivity pattern is also constant.
  New Method: We introduce a novel method, behavior-regressed connectivity
(BRC), to directly examine behavioral fluctuations within an experimental
session and capture their relationship to changes in functional connectivity.
This method employs the weighted phase lag index (WPLI) applied to a window of
trials with a weighting function. Using two datasets, the BRC results are
compared to conventional connectivity results during two time windows: the one
second before stimulus onset to identify predictive relationships, and the one
second after onset to capture task-dependent relationships.
  Results: In both tasks, we replicate the expected results for the
conventional connectivity analysis, and extend our understanding of the
brain-behavior relationship using the BRC analysis, demonstrating
subject-specific connectivity patterns that correspond to both positive and
negative relationships with behavior.
  Comparison with Existing Method(s): Conventional connectivity analyses assume
a consistent relationship between behaviors and functional connectivity, but
the BRC method examines performance variability within an experimental session
to understand dynamic connectivity and transient behavior.
  Conclusion: The BRC approach examines connectivity as it covaries with
behavior to complement the knowledge of underlying neural activity derived from
conventional connectivity analyses. Within this framework, BRC may be
implemented for the purpose of understanding performance variability both
within and between participants.
