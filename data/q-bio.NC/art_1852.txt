Learning intrinsic excitability in medium spiny neurons
We present an unsupervised, local activation-dependent learning rule for
intrinsic plasticity (IP) which affects the composition of ion channel
conductances for single neurons in a use-dependent way. We use a
single-compartment conductance-based model for medium spiny striatal neurons in
order to show the effects of parametrization of individual ion channels on the
neuronal activation function. We show that parameter changes within the
physiological ranges are sufficient to create an ensemble of neurons with
significantly different activation functions. We emphasize that the effects of
intrinsic neuronal variability on spiking behavior require a distributed mode
of synaptic input and can be eliminated by strongly correlated input. We show
how variability and adaptivity in ion channel conductances can be utilized to
store patterns without an additional contribution by synaptic plasticity (SP).
The adaptation of the spike response may result in either "positive" or
"negative" pattern learning. However, read-out of stored information depends on
a distributed pattern of synaptic activity to let intrinsic variability
determine spike response. We briefly discuss the implications of this
conditional memory on learning and addiction.
