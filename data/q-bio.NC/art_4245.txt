Recurrent events of synchrony in complex networks of pulse-coupled
  oscillators
We present and analyze deterministic complex networks of pulse-coupled
oscillators that exhibits recurrent events comprised of an increase and a
decline in synchrony. Events emerging from the networks may form an oscillatory
behavior or may be separated by periods of asynchrony with varying duration.
The phenomenon is specific to spatial networks with both short- and long-ranged
connections and requires delayed interactions and refractoriness of
oscillators.
