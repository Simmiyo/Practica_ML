A biologically constrained model of the whole basal ganglia addressing
  the paradoxes of connections and selection
The basal ganglia nuclei form a complex network of nuclei often assumed to
perform selection, yet their individual roles and how they influence each other
is still largely unclear. In particular, the ties between the external and
internal parts of the globus pallidus are paradoxical, as anatomical data
suggest a potent inhibitory projection between them while electrophys-iological
recordings indicate that they have similar activities. Here we introduce a
theoretical study that reconciles both views on the intra-pallidal projection,
by providing a plausible characterization of the relationship between the
external and internal globus pallidus. Specifically, we developed a mean-field
model of the whole basal ganglia, whose parameterization is optimized to
respect best a collection of numerous anatomical and electrophysiological data.
We first obtained models respecting all our constraints, hence anatomical and
electrophysiological data on the intrapallidal projection are globally
consistent. This model furthermore predicts that both aforementioned views
about the intra-pallidal projection may be reconciled when this projection is
weakly inhibitory, thus making it possible to support similar neural activity
in both nuclei and for the entire basal ganglia to select between actions.
Second, we predicts that afferent projections are substantially unbalanced
towards the external segment, as it receives the strongest excitation from STN
and the weakest inhibition from the striatum. Finally, our study strongly
suggest that the intrapallidal connection pattern is not focused but diffuse,
as this latter pattern is more efficient for the overall selection performed in
the basal ganglia.
