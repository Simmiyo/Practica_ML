Conversion of the chemical concentration of odorous mixtures into odour
  concentration and odour intensity: a comparison of methods
Continuous odour measurements both of emissions as well as ambient
concentrations are seldom realised, mainly because of their high costs. They
are therefore often substituted by concentration measurements of odorous
substances. Then a conversion of the chemical concentrations C (mg m-3) into
odour concentrations COD (ouE m-3) and odour intensities OI is necessary. Four
methods to convert the concentrations of single substances to the odour
concentrations and odour intensities of an odorous mixture are investigated:
(1) direct use of measured concentrations, (2) the sum of the odour activity
value SOAV, (3) the sum of the odour intensities SOI, and (4) the equivalent
odour concentration EOC, as a new method. The methods are evaluated with
olfactometric measurements of seven substances as well as their mixtures. The
results indicate that the SOI and EOC conversion methods deliver reliable
values. These methods use not only the odour threshold concentration but also
the slope of the Weber-Fechner law to include the sensitivity of the odour
perception of the individual substances. They fulfil the criteria of an
objective conversion without the need of a further calibration by additional
olfactometric measurements.
