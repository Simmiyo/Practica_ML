Decoding the Encoding of Functional Brain Networks: an fMRI
  Classification Comparison of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF),
  Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and Sparse Coding Algorithms
Brain networks in fMRI are typically identified using spatial independent
component analysis (ICA), yet mathematical constraints such as sparse coding
and positivity both provide alternate biologically-plausible frameworks for
generating brain networks. Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) would
suppress negative BOLD signal by enforcing positivity. Spatial sparse coding
algorithms ($L1$ Regularized Learning and K-SVD) would impose local
specialization and a discouragement of multitasking, where the total observed
activity in a single voxel originates from a restricted number of possible
brain networks.
  The assumptions of independence, positivity, and sparsity to encode
task-related brain networks are compared; the resulting brain networks for
different constraints are used as basis functions to encode the observed
functional activity at a given time point. These encodings are decoded using
machine learning to compare both the algorithms and their assumptions, using
the time series weights to predict whether a subject is viewing a video,
listening to an audio cue, or at rest, in 304 fMRI scans from 51 subjects.
  For classifying cognitive activity, the sparse coding algorithm of $L1$
Regularized Learning consistently outperformed 4 variations of ICA across
different numbers of networks and noise levels (p$<$0.001). The NMF algorithms,
which suppressed negative BOLD signal, had the poorest accuracy. Within each
algorithm, encodings using sparser spatial networks (containing more
zero-valued voxels) had higher classification accuracy (p$<$0.001). The success
of sparse coding algorithms may suggest that algorithms which enforce sparse
coding, discourage multitasking, and promote local specialization may capture
better the underlying source processes than those which allow inexhaustible
local processes such as ICA.
