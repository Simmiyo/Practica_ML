An Empirical Study of Continuous Connectivity Degree Sequence
  Equivalents
In the present work we demonstrate the use of a parcellation free
connectivity model based on Poisson point processes. This model produces for
each subject a continuous bivariate intensity function that represents for
every possible pair of points the relative rate at which we observe tracts
terminating at those points. We fit this model to explore degree sequence
equivalents for spatial continuum graphs, and to investigate the local
differences between estimated intensity functions for two different
tractography methods. This is a companion paper to Moyer et al. (2016), where
the model was originally defined.
