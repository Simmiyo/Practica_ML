Modeling thalamocortical cell: impact of Ca2+ channel distribution and
  cell geometry on firing pattern
The influence of calcium channel distribution and geometry of the
thalamocortical cell upon its tonic firing and the low threshold spike (LTS)
generation was studied in a 3-compartment model, which represents soma,
proximal and distal dendrites as well as in multi-compartment model using the
morphology of a real reconstructed neuron. Using an uniform distribution of
Ca2+ channels, we determined the minimal number of low threshold
voltage-activated calcium channels and their permeability required for the
onset of LTS in response to a hyperpolarizing current pulse. In the
3-compartment model, we found that the channel distribution influences the
firing pattern only in the range of 3% below the threshold value of total
T-channel density. In the multi-compartmental model, the LTS could be generated
by only 64% of unequally distributed T-channels compared to the minimal number
of equally distributed T-channels. For a given channel density and injected
current, the tonic firing frequency was found to be inversely proportional to
the size of the cell. However, when the Ca2+ channel density was elevated in
soma or proximal dendrites, then the amplitude of LTS response and burst spike
frequencies were determined by the ratio of total to threshold number of
T-channels in the cell for a specific geometry.
