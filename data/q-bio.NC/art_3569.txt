Mitigating Gyral Bias in Cortical Tractography via Asymmetric Fiber
  Orientation Distributions
Diffusion tractography in brain connectomics often involves tracing axonal
trajectories across gray-white matter boundaries in gyral blades of complex
cortical convolutions. To date, gyral bias is observed in most tractography
algorithms with streamlines predominantly terminating at gyral crowns instead
of sulcal banks. This work demonstrates that asymmetric fiber orientation
distribution functions (AFODFs), computed via a multi-tissue global estimation
framework, can mitigate the effects of gyral bias, enabling fiber streamlines
at gyral blades to make sharper turns into the cortical gray matter. We use
ex-vivo data of an adult rhesus macaque and in-vivo data from the Human
Connectome Project (HCP) to show that the fiber streamlines given by AFODFs
bend more naturally into the cortex than the conventional symmetric FODFs in
typical gyral blades. We demonstrate that AFODF tractography improves
cortico-cortical connectivity and provides highly consistent outcomes between
two different field strengths (3T and 7T).
