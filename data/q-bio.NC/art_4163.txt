Limits and dynamics of randomly connected neuronal networks
Networks of the brain are composed of a very large number of neurons
connected through a random graph and interacting after random delays that both
depend on the anatomical distance between cells. In order to comprehend the
role of these random architectures on the dynamics of such networks, we analyze
the mesoscopic and macroscopic limits of networks with random correlated
connectivity weights and delays. We address both averaged and quenched limits,
and show propagation of chaos and convergence to a complex integral
McKean-Vlasov equations with distributed delays. We then instantiate a
completely solvable model illustrating the role of such random architectures in
the emerging macroscopic activity. We particularly focus on the role of
connectivity levels in the emergence of periodic solutions.
