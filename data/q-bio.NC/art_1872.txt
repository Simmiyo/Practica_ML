Biological nonlocality and the mind-brain interaction problem: comments
  on a new empirical approach
Up to now, we have been faced with an age old fundamental dilemma posed by
the mind-brain interaction problem, i.e. how is it that the mind which is
subjective and immaterial, can interact with the brain which is objective and
material? Analysis of recent experiments appears to indicate that quantum
mechanics may have a role to play in the resolution of the mind-brain
interaction problem in the form of biological entanglement and nonlocality.
This analysis, when coupled with ongoing and proposed experiments, may help us
to simultaneously resolve related issues such as whether mental events can
initiate neural events, the transference of conscious subjective experience,
the measurement problem and the binding problem.
