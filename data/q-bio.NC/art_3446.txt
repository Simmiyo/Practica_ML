Zero-calibration cVEP BCI using word prediction: a proof of concept
Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) based on visual evoked potentials (VEP)
allow for spelling from a keyboard of flashing characters. Among VEP BCIs,
code-modulated visual evoked potentials (c-VEPs) are designed for high-speed
communication . In c-VEPs, all characters flash simultaneously. In particular,
each character flashes according to a predefined 63-bit binary sequence
(m-sequence), circular-shifted by a different time lag. For a given character,
the m-sequence evokes a VEP in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of the subject,
which can be used as a template. This template is obtained during a calibration
phase at the beginning of each session. Then, the system outputs the desired
character after a predefined number of repetitions by estimating its time lag
with respect to the template. Our work avoids the calibration phase, by
extracting from the VEP relative lags between successive characters, and
predicting the full word using a dictionary.
