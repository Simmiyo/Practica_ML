Methods for applying the Neural Engineering Framework to neuromorphic
  hardware
We review our current software tools and theoretical methods for applying the
Neural Engineering Framework to state-of-the-art neuromorphic hardware. These
methods can be used to implement linear and nonlinear dynamical systems that
exploit axonal transmission time-delays, and to fully account for nonideal
mixed-analog-digital synapses that exhibit higher-order dynamics with
heterogeneous time-constants. This summarizes earlier versions of these methods
that have been discussed in a more biological context (Voelker & Eliasmith,
2017) or regarding a specific neuromorphic architecture (Voelker et al., 2017).
