Hardware-Amenable Structural Learning for Spike-based Pattern
  Classification using a Simple Model of Active Dendrites
This paper presents a spike-based model which employs neurons with
functionally distinct dendritic compartments for classifying high dimensional
binary patterns. The synaptic inputs arriving on each dendritic subunit are
nonlinearly processed before being linearly integrated at the soma, giving the
neuron a capacity to perform a large number of input-output mappings. The model
utilizes sparse synaptic connectivity; where each synapse takes a binary value.
The optimal connection pattern of a neuron is learned by using a simple
hardware-friendly, margin enhancing learning algorithm inspired by the
mechanism of structural plasticity in biological neurons. The learning
algorithm groups correlated synaptic inputs on the same dendritic branch. Since
the learning results in modified connection patterns, it can be incorporated
into current event-based neuromorphic systems with little overhead. This work
also presents a branch-specific spike-based version of this structural
plasticity rule. The proposed model is evaluated on benchmark binary
classification problems and its performance is compared against that achieved
using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)
techniques. Our proposed method attains comparable performance while utilizing
10 to 50% less computational resources than the other reported techniques.
