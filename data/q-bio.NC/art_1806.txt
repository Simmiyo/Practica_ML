Signal detection by means of phase coherence induced through phase
  resetting
Detection and location of moving prey utilizing electrosense or mechanosense
is a strategy commonly followed by animals which cannot rely on visual sense or
hearing. In this article we consider the possibility to detect the source of a
localized stimulus that travels along a chain of detectors at constant speed.
The detectors are autonomous oscillators whose frequencies have a given natural
spread. The detection mechanism is based on phase coherence which is built up
by phase resetting induced by the passing stimulus.
