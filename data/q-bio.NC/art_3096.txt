An Efficient Method for online Detection of Polychronous Patterns in
  Spiking Neural Network
Polychronous neural groups are effective structures for the recognition of
precise spike-timing patterns but the detection method is an inefficient
multi-stage brute force process that works off-line on pre-recorded simulation
data. This work presents a new model of polychronous patterns that can capture
precise sequences of spikes directly in the neural simulation. In this scheme,
each neuron is assigned a randomized code that is used to tag the post-synaptic
neurons whenever a spike is transmitted. This creates a polychronous code that
preserves the order of pre-synaptic activity and can be registered in a hash
table when the post-synaptic neuron spikes. A polychronous code is a
sub-component of a polychronous group that will occur, along with others, when
the group is active. We demonstrate the representational and pattern
recognition ability of polychronous codes on a direction selective visual task
involving moving bars that is typical of a computation performed by simple
cells in the cortex. The computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm far
exceeds existing polychronous group detection methods and is well suited for
online detection.
