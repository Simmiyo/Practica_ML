Neurophysiological Investigation of Context Modulation based on Musical
  Stimulus
There are numerous studies which suggest that perhaps music is truly the
language of emotions. Music seems to have an almost willful, evasive quality,
defying simple explanation, and indeed requires deeper neurophysiological
investigations to gain a better understanding. The current study makes an
attempt in that direction to explore the effect of context on music perception.
To investigate the same, we measured Galvanic Skin Responses (GSR) and
self-reported emotion on 18 participants while listening to different Ragas
(musical stimulus) composed of different Rasa's (emotional expression) in the
different context (Neutral, Pleasant, and Unpleasant). The IAPS pictures were
used to induce the emotional context in participants. Our results from this
study suggest that the context can modulate emotional response in music
perception but only for a shorter time scale. Interestingly, here we
demonstrate by combining GSR and self-reports that this effect gradually
vanishes over time and shows emotional adaptation irrespective of context. The
overall findings suggest that specific context effects of music perception are
transitory in nature and gets saturated on a longer time scale.
