The Potential of the Human Connectome as a Biomarker of Brain Disease
The human connectome at the level of fiber tracts between brain regions has
been shown to differ in patients with brain disorders compared to healthy
control groups. Nonetheless, there is a potentially large number of different
network organizations for individual patients that could lead to cognitive
deficits prohibiting correct diagnosis. Therefore changes that can distinguish
groups might not be sufficient to diagnose the disease that an individual
patient suffers from and to indicate the best treatment option for that
patient. We describe the challenges introduced by the large variability of
connectomes within healthy subjects and patients and outline three common
strategies to use connectomes as biomarkers of brain diseases. Finally, we
propose a fourth option in using models of simulated brain activity (the
dynamic connectome) based on structural connectivity rather than the structure
(connectome) itself as a biomarker of disease. Dynamic connectomes, in addition
to currently used structural, functional, or effective connectivity, could be
an important future biomarker for clinical applications.
