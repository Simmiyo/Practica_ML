Emerging Frontiers of Neuroengineering: A Network Science of Brain
  Connectivity
Neuroengineering is faced with unique challenges in repairing or replacing
complex neural systems that are composed of many interacting parts. These
interactions form intricate patterns over large spatiotemporal scales, and
produce emergent behaviors that are difficult to predict from individual
elements. Network science provides a particularly appropriate framework in
which to study and intervene in such systems, by treating neural elements
(cells, volumes) as nodes in a graph and neural interactions (synapses, white
matter tracts) as edges in that graph. Here, we review the emerging discipline
of network neuroscience, which uses and develops tools from graph theory to
better understand and manipulate neural systems, from micro- to macroscales. We
present examples of how human brain imaging data is being modeled with network
analysis and underscore potential pitfalls. We then highlight current
computational and theoretical frontiers, and emphasize their utility in
informing diagnosis and monitoring, brain-machine interfaces, and brain
stimulation. A flexible and rapidly evolving enterprise, network neuroscience
provides a set of powerful approaches and fundamental insights critical to the
neuroengineer's toolkit.
