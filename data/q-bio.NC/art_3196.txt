Which spike train distance is most suitable for distinguishing rate and
  temporal coding?
Background: It is commonly assumed in neuronal coding that repeated
presentations of a stimulus to a coding neuron elicit similar responses. One
common way to assess similarity are spike train distances. These can be divided
into spike-resolved, such as the Victor-Purpura and the van Rossum distance,
and time-resolved, e.g. the ISI-, the SPIKE- and the RI-SPIKE-distance.
  New Method: We use independent steady-rate Poisson processes as surrogates
for spike trains with fixed rate and no timing information to address two basic
questions: How does the sensitivity of the different spike train distances to
temporal coding depend on the rates of the two processes and how do the
distances deal with very low rates?
  Results: Spike-resolved distances always contain rate information even for
parameters indicating time coding. This is an issue for reasonably high rates
but beneficial for very low rates. In contrast, the operational range for
detecting time coding of time-resolved distances is superior at normal rates,
but these measures produce artefacts at very low rates. The RI-SPIKE-distance
is the only measure that is sensitive to timing information only.
  Comparison with Existing Methods: While our results on rate-dependent
expectation values for the spike-resolved distances agree with
\citet{Chicharro11}, we here go one step further and specifically investigate
applicability for very low rates.
  Conclusions: The most appropriate measure depends on the rates of the data
being analysed. Accordingly, we summarize our results in one table that allows
an easy selection of the preferred measure for any kind of data.
