Firing Cell: An Artificial Neuron with a Simulation of
  Long-Term-Potentiation-Related Memory
We propose a computational model of neuron, called firing cell (FC),
properties of which cover such phenomena as attenuation of receptors for
external stimuli, delay and decay of postsynaptic potentials, modification of
internal weights due to propagation of postsynaptic potentials through the
dendrite, modification of properties of the analog memory for each input due to
a pattern of short-time synaptic potentiation or long-time synaptic
potentiation (LTP), output-spike generation when the sum of all inputs exceeds
a threshold, and refraction. The cell may take one of the three forms:
excitatory, inhibitory, and receptory. The computer simulations showed that,
depending on the phase of input signals, the artificial neuron's output
frequency may demonstrate various chaotic behaviors.
