Causal Event Networks: Cognition, Complexity and Physical Laws
Information flow framed in a computational and complexity context is relevant
to the understanding of cognitive processes and awareness. In this paper, we
begin with analyzing an information theory framework developed in recent years
under Information and Integration Theory (IIT) based on interactions among
partitions of cognitive information sets. We discuss the scope and limitations
of these ideas, introducing a related measure for partitioning information
sets. We introduce a set of postulates describing cognition as a partially
ordered set of events in space and time. We consider the relevant sequential
and concurrent computational concepts in an idealized minimal cognitive device.
The concept of fundamental cognitive chain formalizes temporal limits of
cognition.
