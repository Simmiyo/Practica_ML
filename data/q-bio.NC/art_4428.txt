Causal and anti-causal learning in pattern recognition for neuroimaging
Pattern recognition in neuroimaging distinguishes between two types of
models: encoding- and decoding models. This distinction is based on the insight
that brain state features, that are found to be relevant in an experimental
paradigm, carry a different meaning in encoding- than in decoding models. In
this paper, we argue that this distinction is not sufficient: Relevant features
in encoding- and decoding models carry a different meaning depending on whether
they represent causal- or anti-causal relations. We provide a theoretical
justification for this argument and conclude that causal inference is essential
for interpretation in neuroimaging.
