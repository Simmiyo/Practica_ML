Cooperative Dynamics of an Artificial Stochastic Resonant System
We have investigated cooperative dynamics of an artificial stochastic
resonant system, which is a recurrent ring connection of neuron-like signal
transducers (NST) based on stochastic resonance (SR), using electronic circuit
experiments. The ring showed quasi-periodic, tunable oscillation driven by only
noise. An oscillation coherently amplified by noise demonstrated that SR may
lead to unusual oscillation features. Furthermore, we found that the ring
showed synchronized oscillation in a chain network composed of multiple rings.
Our results suggest that basic functions (oscillation and synchronization) that
may be used in the central pattern generator of biological system are induced
by collective integration of the NST element.
