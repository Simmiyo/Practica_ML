Multi-Objective Cognitive Model: a supervised approach for multi-subject
  fMRI analysis
In order to decode the human brain, Multivariate Pattern (MVP) classification
generates cognitive models by using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI) datasets. As a standard pipeline in the MVP analysis, brain patterns in
multi-subject fMRI dataset must be mapped to a shared space and then a
classification model is generated by employing the mapped patterns. However,
the MVP models may not provide stable performance on a new fMRI dataset because
the standard pipeline uses disjoint steps for generating these models. Indeed,
each step in the pipeline includes an objective function with independent
optimization approach, where the best solution of each step may not be optimum
for the next steps. For tackling the mentioned issue, this paper introduces the
Multi-Objective Cognitive Model (MOCM) that utilizes an integrated objective
function for MVP analysis rather than just using those disjoint steps. For
solving the integrated problem, we proposed a customized multi-objective
optimization approach, where all possible solutions are firstly generated, and
then our method ranks and selects the robust solutions as the final results.
Empirical studies confirm that the proposed method can generate superior
performance in comparison with other techniques.
