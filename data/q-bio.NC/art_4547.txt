Complete synchronization in coupled Type-I neurons
For a system of type-I neurons bidirectionally coupled through a nonlinear
feedback mechanism, we discuss the issue of noise-induced complete
synchronization (CS). For the inputs to the neurons, we point out that the rate
of change of instantaneous frequency with the instantaneous phase of the
stochastic inputs to each neuron matches exactly with that for the other in the
event of CS of their outputs. Our observation can be exploited in practical
situations to produce completely synchronized outputs in artificial devices.
For excitatory-excitatory synaptic coupling, a functional dependence for the
synchronization error on coupling and noise strengths is obtained. Finally we
report an observation of noise-induced CS between non-identical neurons coupled
bidirectionally through random non-zero couplings in an all-to- all way in a
large neuronal ensemble.
