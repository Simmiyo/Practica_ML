A comparison of methods to determine neuronal phase-response curves
The phase-response curve (PRC) is an important tool to determine the
excitability type of single neurons which reveals consequences for their
synchronizing properties. We review five methods to compute the PRC from both
model data and experimental data and compare the numerically obtained results
from each method. The main difference between the methods lies in the
reliability which is influenced by the fluctuations in the spiking data and the
number of spikes available for analysis. We discuss the significance of our
results and provide guidelines to choose the best method based on the available
data.
