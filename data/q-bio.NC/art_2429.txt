Director Field Model of the Primary Visual Cortex for Contour Detection
We aim to build the simplest possible model capable of detecting long, noisy
contours in a cluttered visual scene. For this, we model the neural dynamics in
the primate primary visual cortex in terms of a continuous director field that
describes the average rate and the average orientational preference of active
neurons at a particular point in the cortex. We then use a linear-nonlinear
dynamical model with long range connectivity patterns to enforce long-range
statistical context present in the analyzed images. The resulting model has
substantially fewer degrees of freedom than traditional models, and yet it can
distinguish large contiguous objects from the background clutter by suppressing
the clutter and by filling-in occluded elements of object contours. This
results in high-precision, high-recall detection of large objects in cluttered
scenes. Parenthetically, our model has a direct correspondence with the Landau
- de Gennes theory of nematic liquid crystal in two dimensions.
