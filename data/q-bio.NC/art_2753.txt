Uniresolution representations of white-matter data from CoCoMac
Tracing data as collated by CoCoMac, a seminal neuroinformatics database, is
at multiple resolutions -- white matter tracts were studied for areas and their
subdivisions by different reports. Network theoretic analysis of this
multi-resolution data often assumes that the data at various resolutions is
equivalent, which may not be correct. In this paper we propose three methods to
resolve the multi-resolution issue such that the resultant networks have
connectivity data at only one resolution. The different resultant networks are
compared in terms of their network analysis metrics and degree distributions.
