Multi-command Chest Tactile Brain Computer Interface for Small Vehicle
  Robot Navigation
The presented study explores the extent to which tactile stimuli delivered to
five chest positions of a healthy user can serve as a platform for a brain
computer interface (BCI) that could be used in an interactive application such
as robotic vehicle operation. The five chest locations are used to evoke
tactile brain potential responses, thus defining a tactile brain computer
interface (tBCI). Experimental results with five subjects performing online
tBCI provide a validation of the chest location tBCI paradigm, while the
feasibility of the concept is illuminated through information-transfer rates.
Additionally an offline classification improvement with a linear SVM classifier
is presented through the case study.
