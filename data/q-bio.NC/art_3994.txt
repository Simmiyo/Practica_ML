Relativistic virtual worlds: an emerging framework
In this paper, I will attempt to establish a framework for representation in
virtual worlds that may allow for input data from many different scales and
virtual physics to be merged. For example, a typical virtual environment must
effectively handle user input, sensor data, and virtual world physics all in
real- time. Merging all of these data into a single interactive system requires
that we adapt approaches from topological methods such as n-dimensional
relativistic representation. A number of hypothetical examples will be provided
throughout the paper to clarify technical challenges that need to be overcome
to realize this vision.
  The long-term goal of this work is that truly invariant representations will
ultimately result from establishing formal, inclusive relationships between
these different domains. Using this framework, incomplete information in one or
more domains can be compensated for by parallelism and mappings within the
virtual world representation. To introduce this approach, I will review recent
developments in embodiment, virtual world technology, and neuroscience relevant
to the control of virtual worlds. The next step will be to borrow ideas from
fields such as brain science, applied mathematics, and cosmology to give proper
perspective to this approach. A simple demonstration will then be given using
an intuitive example of physical relativism. Finally, future directions for the
application of this method will be considered.
