Brain Biomarker Interpretation in ASD Using Deep Learning and fMRI
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder.
Finding the biomarkers associated with ASD is extremely helpful to understand
the underlying roots of the disorder and can lead to earlier diagnosis and more
targeted treatment. Although Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been applied in
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify ASD, understanding the
data-driven computational decision making procedure has not been previously
explored. Therefore, in this work, we address the problem of interpreting
reliable biomarkers associated with identifying ASD; specifically, we propose a
2-stage method that classifies ASD and control subjects using fMRI images and
interprets the saliency features activated by the classifier. First, we trained
an accurate DNN classifier. Then, for detecting the biomarkers, different from
the DNN visualization works in computer vision, we take advantage of the
anatomical structure of brain fMRI and develop a frequency-normalized sampling
method to corrupt images. Furthermore, in the ASD vs. control subjects
classification scenario, we provide a new approach to detect and characterize
important brain features into three categories. The biomarkers we found by the
proposed method are robust and consistent with previous findings in the
literature. We also validate the detected biomarkers by neurological function
decoding and comparing with the DNN activation maps.
