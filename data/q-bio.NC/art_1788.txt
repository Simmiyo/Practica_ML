Presynaptic modulation as fast synaptic switching: state-dependent
  modulation of task performance
Neuromodulatory receptors in presynaptic position have the ability to
suppress synaptic transmission for seconds to minutes when fully engaged. This
effectively alters the synaptic strength of a connection. Much work on
neuromodulation has rested on the assumption that these effects are uniform at
every neuron. However, there is considerable evidence to suggest that
presynaptic regulation may be in effect synapse-specific. This would define a
second "weight modulation" matrix, which reflects presynaptic receptor efficacy
at a given site. Here we explore functional consequences of this hypothesis. By
analyzing and comparing the weight matrices of networks trained on different
aspects of a task, we identify the potential for a low complexity "modulation
matrix", which allows to switch between differently trained subtasks while
retaining general performance characteristics for the task. This means that a
given network can adapt itself to different task demands by regulating its
release of neuromodulators. Specifically, we suggest that (a) a network can
provide optimized responses for related classification tasks without the need
to train entirely separate networks and (b) a network can blend a "memory mode"
which aims at reproducing memorized patterns and a "novelty mode" which aims to
facilitate classification of new patterns. We relate this work to the known
effects of neuromodulators on brain-state dependent processing.
