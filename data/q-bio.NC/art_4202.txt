Hearing the Maximum Entropy Potential of neuronal networks
We consider a spike-generating stationary Markov process whose transition
probabilities are known. We show that there is a canonical potential whose
Gibbs distribution, obtained from the Maximum Entropy Principle (MaxEnt), is
the equilibrium distribution of this process. We provide a method to compute
explicitly and exactly this potential as a linear combination of
spatio-temporal interactions. In particular, our results establish an explicit
relation between Maximum Entropy models and neuro-mimetic models used in spike
train statistics.
