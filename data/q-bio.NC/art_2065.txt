Fast non-negative deconvolution for spike train inference from
  population calcium imaging
Calcium imaging for observing spiking activity from large populations of
neurons are quickly gaining popularity. While the raw data are fluorescence
movies, the underlying spike trains are of interest. This work presents a fast
non-negative deconvolution filter to infer the approximately most likely spike
train for each neuron, given the fluorescence observations. This algorithm
outperforms optimal linear deconvolution (Wiener filtering) on both simulated
and biological data. The performance gains come from restricting the inferred
spike trains to be positive (using an interior-point method), unlike the Wiener
filter. The algorithm is fast enough that even when imaging over 100 neurons,
inference can be performed on the set of all observed traces faster than
real-time. Performing optimal spatial filtering on the images further refines
the estimates. Importantly, all the parameters required to perform the
inference can be estimated using only the fluorescence data, obviating the need
to perform joint electrophysiological and imaging calibration experiments.
