Atomic scale nanoelectronics for quantum neuromorphic devices: comparing
  different materials
I review the advancements of atomic scale nanoelectronics towards quantum
neuromorphics. First, I summarize the key properties of elementary combinations
of few neurons, namely long-- and short--term plasticity, spike-timing
dependent plasticity (associative plasticity), quantumness and stochastic
effects, and their potential computational employment. Next, I review several
atomic scale device technologies developed to control electron transport at the
atomic level, including single atom implantation for atomic arrays and CMOS
quantum dots, single atom memories, Ag$_2$S and Cu$_2$S atomic switches,
hafnium based RRAMs, organic material based transistors, Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$
synapses. Each material/method proved successful in achieving some of the
properties observed in real neurons. I compare the different methods towards
the creation of a new generation of naturally inspired and biophysically
meaningful artificial neurons, in order to replace the rigid CMOS based
neuromorphic hardware. The most challenging aspect to address appears to obtain
both the stochastic/quantum behavior and the associative plasticity, which are
currently observed only below and above 20 nm length scale respectively, by
employing the same material.
