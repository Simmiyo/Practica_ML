The impact of binaural white noise with oscillations of 100 to 750hz in
  the short-term visual working memory and the reactivity of alpha and beta
  cerebral waves
According to some researchers, noise is typically conceived as a detrimental
factor in cognitive performance affecting perception, decision making, and
motor function. However, in recent studies it is associated with white noise
with concentration and calm, therefore, this research seeks to establish the
impact of binaural white noise on the performance of short-term visual and
working memory, the alpha - beta brain activity, attention - meditation,
through the use of two auditory stimuli with frequency ranges of (100 to 450hz)
and (100 to 750hz). This study was conducted in the city of Montes Claros, the
Republic of Brazil, where seven participants were evaluated (n = 7) with an
average age of 36.71, and two age groups (GP1) 21 to 30 and (GP2) 41 50, with
university studies. Within the experimental process, the short-term visual
memory tests were performed using the cognitive assessment battery CAB of
CogniFit, and the recording of brain activities through the use of monopolar
electroencephalogram and the eSense algorithms. With the results obtained and
through the use of statistical tests, we can infer that the binaural white
noise with oscillations of 100 to 750 Hz contributed to the performance of
visual work memory in the short term
