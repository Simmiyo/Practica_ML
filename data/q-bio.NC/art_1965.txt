Topological Maps from Signals
We discuss the task of reconstructing the topological map of an environment
based on the sequences of locations visited by a mobile agent -- this occurs in
systems neuroscience, where one runs into the task of reconstructing the global
topological map of the environment based on activation patterns of the place
coding cells in hippocampus area of the brain. A similar task appears in the
context of establishing wifi connectivity maps.
