Role of Glia cells in the formation of memory in the brain
We build on progress in understanding the role of glia cells in building the
initial networks in the foetal brain. This has led us to make three significant
postulates. Short term memory results from glia cells forming speculative links
directly and solely as a result of neural activity generated by life
experiences. These temporary 'glia bridges' create long term memory by
stimulating the growth of axons, dendrites and synapses and providing the
pathways enabling permanent neural structures to be created. Problem solving,
idea creation and memory maintenance results from this fundamental algorithm
for how the brain generates new links.
