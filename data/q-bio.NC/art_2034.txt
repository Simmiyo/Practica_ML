Indisputable facts when implementing spiking neuron networks
In this article, our wish is to demystify some aspects of coding with
spike-timing, through a simple review of well-understood technical facts
regarding spike coding. The goal is to help better understanding to which
extend computing and modelling with spiking neuron networks can be biologically
plausible and computationally efficient. We intentionally restrict ourselves to
a deterministic dynamics, in this review, and we consider that the dynamics of
the network is defined by a non-stochastic mapping. This allows us to stay in a
rather simple framework and to propose a review with concrete numerical values,
results and formula on (i) general time constraints, (ii) links between
continuous signals and spike trains, (iii) spiking networks parameter
adjustments. When implementing spiking neuron networks, for computational or
biological simulation purposes, it is important to take into account the
indisputable facts here reviewed. This precaution could prevent from
implementing mechanisms meaningless with regards to obvious time constraints,
or from introducing spikes artificially, when continuous calculations would be
sufficient and simpler. It is also pointed out that implementing a spiking
neuron network is finally a simple task, unless complex neural codes are
considered.
