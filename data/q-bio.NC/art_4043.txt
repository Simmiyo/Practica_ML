A structural model of emotions of cognitive dissonances
Cognitive dissonance is the stress that comes from holding two conflicting
thoughts simultaneously in the mind, usually arising when people are asked to
choose between two detrimental or two beneficial options. In view of the
well-established role of emotions in decision making, here we investigate
whether the conventional structural models used to represent the relationships
among basic emotions, such as the Circumplex model of affect, can describe the
emotions of cognitive dissonance as well. We presented a questionnaire to 34
anonymous participants, where each question described a decision to be made
among two conflicting motivations and asked the participants to rate
analogically the pleasantness and the intensity of the experienced emotion. We
found that the results were compatible with the predictions of the Circumplex
model for basic emotions.
