Winner-Relaxing Self-Organizing Maps
A new family of self-organizing maps, the Winner-Relaxing Kohonen Algorithm,
is introduced as a generalization of a variant given by Kohonen in 1991. The
magnification behaviour is calculated analytically. For the original variant a
magnification exponent of 4/7 is derived; the generalized version allows to
steer the magnification in the wide range from exponent 1/2 to 1 in the
one-dimensional case, thus provides optimal mapping in the sense of information
theory. The Winner Relaxing Algorithm requires minimal extra computations per
learning step and is conveniently easy to implement.
