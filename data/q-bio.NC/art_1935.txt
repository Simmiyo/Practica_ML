Detection of subthreshold pulses in neurons with channel noise
Neurons are subject to various kinds of noise. In addition to synaptic noise,
the stochastic opening and closing of ion channels represents an intrinsic
source of noise that affects the signal processing properties of the neuron. In
this paper, we studied the response of a stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley neuron to
transient input subthreshold pulses. It was found that the average response
time decreases but variance increases as the amplitude of channel noise
increases. In the case of single pulse detection, we show that channel noise
enables one neuron to detect the subthreshold signals and an optimal membrane
area (or channel noise intensity) exists for a single neuron to achieve optimal
performance. However, the detection ability of a single neuron is limited by
large errors. Here, we test a simple neuronal network that can enhance the
pulse detecting abilities of neurons and find dozens of neurons can perfectly
detect subthreshold pulses. The phenomenon of intrinsic stochastic resonance is
also found both at the level of single neurons and at the level of networks. At
the network level, the detection ability of networks can be optimized for the
number of neurons comprising the network.
