Plausibility of Quantum Coherent States in Biological Systems
In this paper we briefly discuss the necessity of using quantum mechanics as
a fundamental theory applicable to some key functional aspects of biological
systems. This is especially relevant to three important parts of a neuron in
the human brain, namely the cell membrane, microtubules (MT) and ion channels.
We argue that the recently published papers criticizing the use of quantum
theory in these systems are not convincing.
