Illustrating a neural model of logic computations: The case of Sherlock
  Holmes' old maxim
Natural languages can express some logical propositions that humans are able
to understand. We illustrate this fact with a famous text that Conan Doyle
attributed to Holmes: 'It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded
the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth'. This
is a subtle logical statement usually felt as an evident truth. The problem we
are trying to solve is the cognitive reason for such a feeling. We postulate
here that we accept Holmes' maxim as true because our adult brains are equipped
with neural modules that naturally perform modal logical computations.
