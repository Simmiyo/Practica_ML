How informative are spatial CA3 representations established by the
  dentate gyrus?
In the mammalian hippocampus, the dentate gyrus (DG) is characterized by
sparse and powerful unidirectional projections to CA3 pyramidal cells, the
so-called mossy fibers. Mossy fiber synapses appear to duplicate, in terms of
the information they convey, what CA3 cells already receive from entorhinal
cortex layer II cells, which project both to the dentate gyrus and to CA3.
Computational models of episodic memory have hypothesized that the function of
the mossy fibers is to enforce a new, well separated pattern of activity onto
CA3 cells, to represent a new memory, prevailing over the interference produced
by the traces of older memories already stored on CA3 recurrent collateral
connections. Can this hypothesis apply also to spatial representations, as
described by recent neurophysiological recordings in rats? To address this
issue quantitatively, we estimate the amount of information DG can impart on a
new CA3 pattern of spatial activity, using both mathematical analysis and
computer simulations of a simplified model. We confirm that, also in the
spatial case, the observed sparse connectivity and level of activity are most
appropriate for driving memory storage and not to initiate retrieval.
Surprisingly, the model also indicates that even when DG codes just for space,
much of the information it passes on to CA3 acquires a non-spatial and episodic
character, akin to that of a random number generator. It is suggested that
further hippocampal processing is required to make full spatial use of DG
inputs.
