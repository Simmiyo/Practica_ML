Geometry and dimensionality reduction of feature spaces in primary
  visual cortex
Some geometric properties of the wavelet analysis performed by visual neurons
are discussed and compared with experimental data. In particular, several
relationships between the cortical morphologies and the parametric dependencies
of extracted features are formalized and considered from a harmonic analysis
point of view.
