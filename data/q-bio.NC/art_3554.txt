Quantum entanglement in physical and cognitive systems: a conceptual
  analysis and a general representation
We provide a general description of the phenomenon of entanglement in
bipartite systems, as it manifests in micro and macro physical systems, as well
as in human cognitive processes. We do so by observing that when genuine
coincidence measurements are considered, the violation of the 'marginal laws',
in addition to the Bell-CHSH inequality, is also to be expected. The situation
can be described in the quantum formalism by considering the presence of
entanglement not only at the level of the states, but also at the level of the
measurements. However, at the "local'" level of a specific joint measurement, a
description where entanglement is only incorporated in the state remains always
possible, by adopting a fine-tuned tensor product representation. But
contextual tensor product representations should only be considered when there
are good reasons to describe the outcome-states as (non-entangled) product
states. This will not in general be true, hence, the entangement resource will
have to generally be allocated both in the states and in the measurements. In
view of the numerous violations of the marginal laws observed in physics'
laboratories, it remains unclear to date if entanglement in micro-physical
systems is to be understood only as an 'entanglement of the states', or also as
an 'entanglement of the measurements'. But even if measurements would also be
entangled, the corresponding violation of the marginal laws (no-signaling
conditions) would not for this imply that a superluminal communication would be
possible.
