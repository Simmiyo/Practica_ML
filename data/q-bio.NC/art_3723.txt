What's in a name?
Among the several findings deriving from the application of complex network
formalism to the investigation of natural phenomena, the fact that linguistic
constructions follow power laws presents special interest for its potential
implications for psychology and brain science. By corresponding to one of the
most essentially human manifestations, such language-related properties suggest
that similar dynamics may also be inherent to the brain areas related to
language and associative memory, and perhaps even consciousness. The present
work reports a preliminary experimental investigation aimed at characterizing
and modeling the flow of sequentially induced associations between words from
the English language in terms of complex networks. The data is produced through
a psychophysical experiment where a word is presented to the subject, who is
requested to associate another word. Complex network and graph theory formalism
and measurements are applied in order to characterize the experimental data.
Several interesting results are identified, including the characterization of
attraction basins, association asymmetries, context biasing, as well as a
possible power-law underlying word associations, which could be explained by
the appearance of strange loops along the hierarchical structure underlying
word categories.
