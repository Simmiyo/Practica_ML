Robots that can adapt like animals
As robots leave the controlled environments of factories to autonomously
function in more complex, natural environments, they will have to respond to
the inevitable fact that they will become damaged. However, while animals can
quickly adapt to a wide variety of injuries, current robots cannot "think
outside the box" to find a compensatory behavior when damaged: they are limited
to their pre-specified self-sensing abilities, can diagnose only anticipated
failure modes, and require a pre-programmed contingency plan for every type of
potential damage, an impracticality for complex robots. Here we introduce an
intelligent trial and error algorithm that allows robots to adapt to damage in
less than two minutes, without requiring self-diagnosis or pre-specified
contingency plans. Before deployment, a robot exploits a novel algorithm to
create a detailed map of the space of high-performing behaviors: This map
represents the robot's intuitions about what behaviors it can perform and their
value. If the robot is damaged, it uses these intuitions to guide a
trial-and-error learning algorithm that conducts intelligent experiments to
rapidly discover a compensatory behavior that works in spite of the damage.
Experiments reveal successful adaptations for a legged robot injured in five
different ways, including damaged, broken, and missing legs, and for a robotic
arm with joints broken in 14 different ways. This new technique will enable
more robust, effective, autonomous robots, and suggests principles that animals
may use to adapt to injury.
