The Information Theory of Emotions of Musical Chords
The paper offers a solution to the centuries-old puzzle - why the major
chords are perceived as happy and the minor chords as sad - based on the
information theory of emotions. A theory and a formula of musical emotions were
created. They define the sign and the amplitude of the utilitarian emotional
coloration of separate major and minor chords through relative pitches of
constituent sounds. Keywords: chord, major, minor, the formula of musical
emotions, the information theory of emotions.
