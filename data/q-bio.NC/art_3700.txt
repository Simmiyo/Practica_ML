Neural network design for J function approximation in dynamic
  programming
This paper shows that a new type of artificial neural network (ANN) -- the
Simultaneous Recurrent Network (SRN) -- can, if properly trained, solve a
difficult function approximation problem which conventional ANNs -- either
feedforward or Hebbian -- cannot. This problem, the problem of generalized maze
navigation, is typical of problems which arise in building true intelligent
control systems using neural networks. (Such systems are discussed in the
chapter by Werbos in K.Pribram, Brain and Values, Erlbaum 1998.) The paper
provides a general review of other types of recurrent networks and alternative
training techniques, including a flowchart of the Error Critic training design,
arguable the only plausible approach to explain how the brain adapts
time-lagged recurrent systems in real-time. The C code of the test is appended.
As in the first tests of backprop, the training here was slow, but there are
ways to do better after more experience using this type of network.
