Novel insights into the dynamics of intractable human epilepsy
Probability density functions and the probability of Sz occurrence
conditional upon the time elapsed from the previous Sz were estimated using the
energy and intervals of SZ in prolonged recordings from subjects with
localization- related pharmaco-resistant epilepsy, undergoing surgical
evaluation. Clinical and subclinical seizure E and ISI distributions are
governed by power laws in subjects on reduced doses of anti-seizure drugs.
There is increased probability of Sz occurrence 30 minutes before and after a
seizure and the time to next seizure increases with the duration of the
seizure-free interval since the last one. Also, over short time scales,
``seizures may beget seizures.'' The cumulative empirical evidence is
compatible with and suggests that at least over short time scales, seizures
have the inherent capacity of triggering other seizures. This may explain the
tendency of seizures to cluster and evolve into status epilepticus. Power law
distributions of E and ISI indicate these features lack a typical size/duration
and may not be accurate criteria or sufficient for classifying paroxysmal
activity as ictal or interictal. This dependency and the existence of power law
distributions raise the possibility that Sz occurrence and intensity may be
predictable, without specifying the likelihood of success.
