Closed Curves and Elementary Visual Object Identification
For two closed curves on a plane (discrete version) and local criteria for
similarity of points on the curves one gets a potential, which describes the
similarity between curve points. This is the base for a global similarity
measure of closed curves (Fr\'echet distance). I use borderlines of handwritten
digits to demonstrate an area of application. I imagine, measuring the
similarity of closed curves is an essential and elementary task performed by a
visual system. This approach to similarity measures may be used by visual
systems.
