Discovery and Visualization of Nonstationary Causal Models
It is commonplace to encounter nonstationary data, of which the underlying
generating process may change over time or across domains. The nonstationarity
presents both challenges and opportunities for causal discovery. In this paper
we propose a principled framework to handle nonstationarity, and develop some
methods to address three important questions. First, we propose an enhanced
constraint-based method to detect variables whose local mechanisms are
nonstationary and recover the skeleton of the causal structure over observed
variables. Second, we present a way to determine some causal directions by
taking advantage of information carried by changing distributions. Third, we
develop a method for visualizing the nonstationarity of causal modules.
Experimental results on various synthetic and real-world data sets are
presented to demonstrate the efficacy of our methods.
