Causal interpretation rules for encoding and decoding models in
  neuroimaging
Causal terminology is often introduced in the interpretation of encoding and
decoding models trained on neuroimaging data. In this article, we investigate
which causal statements are warranted and which ones are not supported by
empirical evidence. We argue that the distinction between encoding and decoding
models is not sufficient for this purpose: relevant features in encoding and
decoding models carry a different meaning in stimulus- and in response-based
experimental paradigms. We show that only encoding models in the stimulus-based
setting support unambiguous causal interpretations. By combining encoding and
decoding models trained on the same data, however, we obtain insights into
causal relations beyond those that are implied by each individual model type.
We illustrate the empirical relevance of our theoretical findings on EEG data
recorded during a visuo-motor learning task.
