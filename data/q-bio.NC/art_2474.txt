Intrinsically Motivated Learning of Visual Motion Perception and Smooth
  Pursuit
We extend the framework of efficient coding, which has been used to model the
development of sensory processing in isolation, to model the development of the
perception/action cycle. Our extension combines sparse coding and reinforcement
learning so that sensory processing and behavior co-develop to optimize a
shared intrinsic motivational signal: the fidelity of the neural encoding of
the sensory input under resource constraints. Applying this framework to a
model system consisting of an active eye behaving in a time varying
environment, we find that this generic principle leads to the simultaneous
development of both smooth pursuit behavior and model neurons whose properties
are similar to those of primary visual cortical neurons selective for different
directions of visual motion. We suggest that this general principle may form
the basis for a unified and integrated explanation of many perception/action
loops.
