The brain: What is critical about it?
We review the recent proposal that the most fascinating brain properties are
related to the fact that it always stays close to a second order phase
transition. In such conditions, the collective of neuronal groups can reliably
generate robust and flexible behavior, because it is known that at the critical
point there is the largest abundance of metastable states to choose from. Here
we review the motivation, arguments and recent results, as well as further
implications of this view of the functioning brain.
