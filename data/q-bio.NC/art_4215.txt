Randomized co-training: from cortical neurons to machine learning and
  back again
Despite its size and complexity, the human cortex exhibits striking
anatomical regularities, suggesting there may simple meta-algorithms underlying
cortical learning and computation. We expect such meta-algorithms to be of
interest since they need to operate quickly, scalably and effectively with
little-to-no specialized assumptions.
  This note focuses on a specific question: How can neurons use vast quantities
of unlabeled data to speed up learning from the comparatively rare labels
provided by reward systems? As a partial answer, we propose randomized
co-training as a biologically plausible meta-algorithm satisfying the above
requirements. As evidence, we describe a biologically-inspired algorithm,
Correlated Nystrom Views (XNV) that achieves state-of-the-art performance in
semi-supervised learning, and sketch work in progress on a neuronal
implementation.
