Evaluating 35 Methods to Generate Structural Connectomes Using Pairwise
  Classification
There is no consensus on how to construct structural brain networks from
diffusion MRI. How variations in pre-processing steps affect network
reliability and its ability to distinguish subjects remains opaque. In this
work, we address this issue by comparing 35 structural connectome-building
pipelines. We vary diffusion reconstruction models, tractography algorithms and
parcellations. Next, we classify structural connectome pairs as either
belonging to the same individual or not. Connectome weights and eight
topological derivative measures form our feature set. For experiments, we use
three test-retest datasets from the Consortium for Reliability and
Reproducibility (CoRR) comprised of a total of 105 individuals. We also compare
pairwise classification results to a commonly used parametric test-retest
measure, Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC).
