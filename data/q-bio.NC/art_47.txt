Inhibitory synchrony as a mechanism for attentional gain modulation
Recordings from area V4 of monkeys have revealed that when the focus of
attention is on a visual stimulus within the receptive field of a cortical
neuron, two distinct changes can occur: The firing rate of the neuron can
change and there can be an increase in the coherence between spikes and the
local field potential in the gamma-frequency range (30-50 Hz). The hypothesis
explored here is that these observed effects of attention could be a
consequence of changes in the synchrony of local interneuron networks. We
performed computer simulations of a Hodgkin-Huxley type neuron driven by a
constant depolarizing current, I, representing visual stimulation and a
modulatory inhibitory input representing the effects of attention via local
interneuron networks. We observed that the neuron's firing rate and the
coherence of its output spike train with the synaptic inputs was modulated by
the degree of synchrony of the inhibitory inputs. The model suggest that the
observed changes in firing rate and coherence of neurons in the visual cortex
could be controlled by top-down inputs that regulated the coherence in the
activity of a local inhibitory network discharging at gamma frequencies.
