BindsNET: A machine learning-oriented spiking neural networks library in
  Python
The development of spiking neural network simulation software is a critical
component enabling the modeling of neural systems and the development of
biologically inspired algorithms. Existing software frameworks support a wide
range of neural functionality, software abstraction levels, and hardware
devices, yet are typically not suitable for rapid prototyping or application to
problems in the domain of machine learning. In this paper, we describe a new
Python package for the simulation of spiking neural networks, specifically
geared towards machine learning and reinforcement learning. Our software,
called BindsNET, enables rapid building and simulation of spiking networks and
features user-friendly, concise syntax. BindsNET is built on top of the PyTorch
deep neural networks library, enabling fast CPU and GPU computation for large
spiking networks. The BindsNET framework can be adjusted to meet the needs of
other existing computing and hardware environments, e.g., TensorFlow. We also
provide an interface into the OpenAI gym library, allowing for training and
evaluation of spiking networks on reinforcement learning problems. We argue
that this package facilitates the use of spiking networks for large-scale
machine learning experimentation, and show some simple examples of how we
envision BindsNET can be used in practice. BindsNET code is available at
