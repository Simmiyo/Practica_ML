Characterization of Brain Cortical Morphology Using Localized
  Topology-Encoding Graphs
The human brain cortical layer has a convoluted morphology that is unique to
each individual. Characterization of the cortical morphology is necessary in
longitudinal studies of structural brain change, as well as in discriminating
individuals in health and disease. A method for encoding the cortical
morphology in the form of a graph is presented. The design of graphs that
encode the global cerebral hemisphere cortices as well as localized cortical
regions is proposed. Spectral features of these graphs are then studied and
proposed as descriptors of cortical morphology. As proof-of-concept of their
applicability in characterizing cortical morphology, the descriptors are
studied in the context of discriminating individuals based on their sex.
