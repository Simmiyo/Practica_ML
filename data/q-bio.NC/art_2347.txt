Spike train statistics and Gibbs distributions
This paper is based on a lecture given in the LACONEU summer school,
Valparaiso, January 2012. We introduce Gibbs distribution in a general setting,
including non stationary dynamics, and present then three examples of such
Gibbs distributions, in the context of neural networks spike train statistics:
(i) Maximum entropy model with spatio-temporal constraints; (ii) Generalized
Linear Models; (iii) Conductance based Inte- grate and Fire model with chemical
synapses and gap junctions.
