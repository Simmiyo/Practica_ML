The collective brain is critical
The unique dynamical features of the critical state endow the brain with
properties which are fundamental for adaptive behavior. This proposal, put
forward with Per Bak several years ago, is now supported by a wide body of
empirical evidence at different scales demonstrating that the spatiotemporal
brain dynamics exhibits key signatures of critical dynamics previously
recognized in other complex systems. The rationale behind this program is
discussed in these notes, followed by an account of the most recent results,
together with a discussion of the physiological significance of these ideas.
