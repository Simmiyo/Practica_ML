Energy cost reduction in the synchronization of a pair of nonidentical
  coupled Hindmarsh-Rose neurons
Many biological processes involve synchronization between nonequivalent
systems, i.e, systems where the difference is limited to a rather small
parameter mismatch. The maintenance of the synchronized regime in this cases is
energetically costly \cite{1}. This work studies the energy implications of
synchronization phenomena in a pair of structurally flexible coupled neurons
that interact through electrical coupling. We show that the forced
synchronization between two nonidentical neurons creates appropriate conditions
for an efficient actuation of adaptive laws able to make the neurons
structurally approach their behaviours in order to decrease the flow of energy
required to maintain the synchronization regime.
