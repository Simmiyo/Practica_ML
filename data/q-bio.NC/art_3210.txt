Markov Brains: A Technical Introduction
Markov Brains are a class of evolvable artificial neural networks (ANN). They
differ from conventional ANNs in many aspects, but the key difference is that
instead of a layered architecture, with each node performing the same function,
Markov Brains are networks built from individual computational components.
These computational components interact with each other, receive inputs from
sensors, and control motor outputs. The function of the computational
components, their connections to each other, as well as connections to sensors
and motors are all subject to evolutionary optimization. Here we describe in
detail how a Markov Brain works, what techniques can be used to study them, and
how they can be evolved.
