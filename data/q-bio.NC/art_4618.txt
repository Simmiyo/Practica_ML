Multilayer motif analysis of brain networks
In the last decade, network science has shed new light both on the structural
(anatomical) and on the functional (correlations in the activity) connectivity
among the different areas of the human brain. The analysis of brain networks
has made possible to detect the central areas of a neural system, and to
identify its building blocks by looking at overabundant small subgraphs, known
as motifs. However, network analysis of the brain has so far mainly focused on
anatomical and functional networks as separate entities. The recently developed
mathematical framework of multi-layer networks allows to perform an analysis of
the human brain where the structural and functional layers are considered
together. In this work we describe how to classify the subgraphs of a multiplex
network, and we extend motif analysis to networks with an arbitrary number of
layers. We then extract multi-layer motifs in brain networks of healthy
subjects by considering networks with two layers, anatomical and functional,
respectively obtained from diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging.
Results indicate that subgraphs in which the presence of a physical connection
between brain areas (links at the structural layer) coexists with a non-trivial
positive correlation in their activities are statistically overabundant.
Finally, we investigate the existence of a reinforcement mechanism between the
two layers by looking at how the probability to find a link in one layer
depends on the intensity of the connection in the other one. Showing that
functional connectivity is non-trivially constrained by the underlying
anatomical network, our work contributes to a better understanding of the
interplay between structure and function in the human brain.
