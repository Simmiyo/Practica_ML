A cortical-inspired geometry for contour perception and motion
  integration
In this paper we develop a geometrical model of functional architecture for
the processing of spatio-temporal visual stimuli. The model arises from the
properties of the receptive field linear dynamics of orientation and
speed-selective cells in the visual cortex, that can be embedded in the
definition of a geometry where the connectivity between points is driven by the
contact structure of a 5D manifold. Then, we compute the stochastic kernels
that are the approximations of two Fokker Planck operators associated to the
geometry, and implement them as facilitation patterns within a neural
population activity model, in order to reproduce some psychophysiological
findings about the perception of contours in motion and trajectories of points
found in the literature.
