Neural network learning dynamics in a path integral framework
A path-integral formalism is proposed for studying the dynamical evolution in
time of patterns in an artificial neural network in the presence of noise. An
effective cost function is constructed which determines the unique global
minimum of the neural network system. The perturbative method discussed also
provides a way for determining the storage capacity of the network.
