A Plantar-pressure Based Tongue-placed Tactile Biofeedback System for
  Balance Improvement
Maintaining an upright stance represents a complex task, which is achieved by
integrating sensory information from the visual, vestibular and somatosensory
systems. When one of these sensory inputs becomes unavailable and/or inaccurate
and/or unreliable, postural control generally is degraded. One way to solve
this problem is to supplement and/or substitute limited/altered/missing sensory
information by providing additional sensory information to the central nervous
system via an alternative sensory modality. Along these lines, we developed an
original biofeedback system [1] whose underlying principle consists in
supplying the user with supplementary sensory information related to foot sole
pressure distribution through a tongue-placed output device (Tongue Display
Unit, "TDU" [2]). The purpose of the present experiment was to assess its
effectiveness in improving balance in young healthy adults.
