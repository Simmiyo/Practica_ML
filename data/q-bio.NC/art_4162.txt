Statistical mechanics of the US Supreme Court
We build simple models for the distribution of voting patterns in a group,
using the Supreme Court of the United States as an example. The least
structured, or maximum entropy, model that is consistent with the observed
pairwise correlations among justices' votes is equivalent to an Ising spin
glass. While all correlations (perhaps surprisingly) are positive, the
effective pairwise interactions in the spin glass model have both signs,
recovering some of our intuition that justices on opposite sides of the
ideological spectrum should have a negative influence on one another. Despite
the competing interactions, a strong tendency toward unanimity emerges from the
model, and this agrees quantitatively with the data. The model shows that
voting patterns are organized in a relatively simple "energy landscape,"
correctly predicts the extent to which each justice is correlated with the
majority, and gives us a measure of the influence that justices exert on one
another. These results suggest that simple models, grounded in statistical
physics, can capture essential features of collective decision making
quantitatively, even in a complex political context.
