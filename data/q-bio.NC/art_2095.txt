Sequential Sparsening by Successive Adaptation in Neural Populations
In the principal cells of the insect mushroom body, the Kenyon cells (KC),
olfactory information is represented by a spatially and temporally sparse code.
Each odor stimulus will activate only a small portion of neurons and each
stimulus leads to only a short phasic response following stimulus onset
irrespective of the actual duration of a constant stimulus. The mechanisms
responsible for the sparse code in the KCs are yet unresolved.
  Here, we explore the role of the neuron-intrinsic mechanism of
spike-frequency adaptation (SFA) in producing temporally sparse responses to
sensory stimulation in higher processing stages. Our single neuron model is
defined through a conductance-based integrate-and-fire neuron with
spike-frequency adaptation [1]. We study a fully connected feed-forward network
architecture in coarse analogy to the insect olfactory pathway. A first layer
of ten neurons represents the projection neurons (PNs) of the antenna lobe. All
PNs receive a step-like input from the olfactory receptor neurons, which was
realized by independent Poisson processes. The second layer represents 100 KCs
which converge onto ten neurons in the output layer which represents the
population of mushroom body extrinsic neurons (ENs).
  Our simulation result matches with the experimental observations. In
particular, intracellular recordings of PNs show a clear phasic-tonic response
that outlasts the stimulus [2] while extracellular recordings from KCs in the
locust express sharp transient responses [3]. We conclude that the
neuron-intrinsic mechanism is can explain a progressive temporal response
sparsening in the insect olfactory system. Further experimental work is needed
to test this hypothesis empirically.
