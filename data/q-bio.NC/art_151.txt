Information processing at single neuron level
Based on numerical simulation of Hodgkin and Huxley type neuron stimulated
from many synaptic inputs, an abstract concept of signal processing in
individual neuron is proposed. In the concept proposed, neuron performs binding
of synaptic inputs into a single output event, based on the degree of temporal
coherence between the inputs. Inhibition serves as controlling factor of this
type of binding.
