Clarifying Cognitive Control and the Controllable Connectome
Cognitive control researchers aim to describe the processes that support
adaptive cognition to achieve specific goals. Control theorists consider how to
influence the state of systems to reach certain user-defined goals. In brain
networks, some conceptual and lexical similarities between cognitive control
and control theory offer appealing avenues for scientific discovery. However,
these opportunities also come with the risk of conceptual confusion. Here, I
suggest that each field of inquiry continues to produce novel and distinct
insights. Then, I describe opportunities for synergistic research at the
intersection of these subdisciplines with a critical stance that reduces the
risk of conceptual confusion. Through this exercise, we can observe that both
cognitive neuroscience and systems engineering have much to contribute to
cognitive control research in human brain networks.
