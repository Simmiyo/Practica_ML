Decision-making and interacting neuron populations
In this article we present the modeling of bi-stability view problems
described by the activity or firing rates of two interacting population of
neurons. Starting from the study of a complex system, the sys-tem of stochastic
differential equations describing the time evolution of the activity of the two
populations of neurons, we point out the strength and weakness of this model
and consider its associated par-tial differential equation, which resolution
gives statistical information on the firing rates distributions. The slow-fast
characterization of the solutions finally leads us to a complexity reduction of
the model by the definition of a one-dimensional stochastic differential
equation and its associated one-dimensional partial differential equation. This
last model turns out to be well adapted to the resolution of the prob-lem
giving access, in particular, to reaction times and performance, two
macroscopic variables describing the decision-making in the view problem.
