Analysis of EEG signal by Flicker Noise Spectroscopy: Identification of
  right/left hand movement imagination
Flicker Noise Spectroscopy (FNS) has been used for the analysis of
electroencephalography (EEG) signal related to the movement imagination. The
analysis of sensorimotor rhythms in time-frequency maps reveals the
event-related desynchronization (ERD) and the post-movement event-related
synchronization (ERS), observed mainly in the contralateral hemisphere to the
hand moved for the motor imagery. The signal has been parameterized in
accordance with FNS method. The significant changes of the FNS parameters, at
the time when the subject imagines the movement, have been observed. The
analysis of these parameters allows to distinguish between imagination of right
and left hands movement. Our study shows that the flicker-noise spectroscopy
can be an alternative method of analyzing EEG signal related to the imagination
of movement in terms of a potential application in the brain-computer interface
(BCI).
