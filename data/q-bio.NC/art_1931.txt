Outline of a novel architecture for cortical computation
In this paper a novel architecture for cortical computation has been
proposed. This architecture is composed of computing paths consisting of
neurons and synapses only. These paths have been decomposed into lateral,
longitudinal and vertical components. Cortical computation has then been
decomposed into lateral computation (LaC), longitudinal computation (LoC) and
vertical computation (VeC). It has been shown that various loop structures in
the cortical circuit play important roles in cortical computation as well as in
memory storage and retrieval, keeping in conformity with the molecular basis of
short and long term memory. A new learning scheme for the brain has also been
proposed and how it is implemented within the proposed architecture has been
explained. A number of mathematical results about the architecture have been
proposed, many of which without proof.
