Stochastic Subsampling for Factorizing Huge Matrices
We present a matrix-factorization algorithm that scales to input matrices
with both huge number of rows and columns. Learned factors may be sparse or
dense and/or non-negative, which makes our algorithm suitable for dictionary
learning, sparse component analysis, and non-negative matrix factorization. Our
algorithm streams matrix columns while subsampling them to iteratively learn
the matrix factors. At each iteration, the row dimension of a new sample is
reduced by subsampling, resulting in lower time complexity compared to a simple
streaming algorithm. Our method comes with convergence guarantees to reach a
stationary point of the matrix-factorization problem. We demonstrate its
efficiency on massive functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging data (2 TB), and on
patches extracted from hyperspectral images (103 GB). For both problems, which
involve different penalties on rows and columns, we obtain significant
speed-ups compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.
