Remote synchronization reveals network symmetries and functional modules
We study a Kuramoto model in which the oscillators are associated with the
nodes of a complex network and the interactions include a phase frustration,
thus preventing full synchronization. The system organizes into a regime of
remote synchronization where pairs of nodes with the same network symmetry are
fully synchronized, despite their distance on the graph. We provide analytical
arguments to explain this result and we show how the frustration parameter
affects the distribution of phases. An application to brain networks suggests
that anatomical symmetry plays a role in neural synchronization by determining
correlated functional modules across distant locations.
