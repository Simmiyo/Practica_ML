On the scaling law for cortical magnification factor
Primate visual system samples different parts of the world unevenly. The part
of the visual scene corresponding to the eye center is represented densely,
while away from the center the sampling becomes progressively sparser. Such
distribution allows a more effective use of the limited transfer rate of the
optic nerve, since animals can aim area centralis (AC) at the relevant position
in the scene by performing saccadic eye movements. To locate a new saccade
target the animal has to sample the corresponding region of the visual scene,
away from AC. In this work we derive the sampling density away from AC, which
optimizes the trajectory of saccadic eye movements. We obtain the scaling law
for the sampling density as a function of eccentricity, which results from the
evolutionary pressure to locate the target in the shortest time under the
constraint of limited transfer rate of the optic nerve. In case of very small
AC the visual scene is optimally represented by logarithmic conformal mapping,
in which geometrically similar circular bands around AC are equally represented
by the visual system. We also obtain corrections to the logarithmic scaling for
the case of a larger AC and compare them to experimental findings.
