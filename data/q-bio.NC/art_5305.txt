Information-theoretic interpretation of tuning curves for multiple
  motion directions
We have developed an efficient information-maximization method for computing
the optimal shapes of tuning curves of sensory neurons by optimizing the
parameters of the underlying feedforward network model. When applied to the
problem of population coding of visual motion with multiple directions, our
method yields several types of tuning curves with both symmetric and asymmetric
shapes that resemble what have been found in the visual cortex. Our result
suggests that the diversity or heterogeneity of tuning curve shapes as observed
in neurophysiological experiment might actually constitute an optimal
population representation of visual motions with multiple components.
