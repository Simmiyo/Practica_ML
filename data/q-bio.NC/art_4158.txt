Autonomous search for a diffusive source in an unknown environment
The paper presents an approach to olfactory search for a diffusive emitting
source of tracer (e.g. aerosol, gas) in an environment with unknown map of
randomly placed and shaped obstacles.
  The measurements of tracer concentration are sporadic, noisy and without
directional information. The search domain is discretised and modelled by a
finite two-dimensional lattice. The links is the lattice represent the
traversable paths for emitted particles and for the searcher. A missing link in
the lattice indicates a blocked paths, due to the walls or obstacles. The
searcher must simultaneously estimate the source parameters, the map of the
search domain and its own location within the map. The solution is formulated
in the sequential Bayesian framework and implemented as a Rao-Blackwellised
particle filter with information-driven motion control. The numerical results
demonstrate the concept and its performance.
