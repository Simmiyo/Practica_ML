Defecting or not defecting: how to "read" human behavior during
  cooperative games by EEG measurements
Understanding the neural mechanisms responsible for human social interactions
is difficult, since the brain activities of two or more individuals have to be
examined simultaneously and correlated with the observed social patterns. We
introduce the concept of hyper-brain network, a connectivity pattern
representing at once the information flow among the cortical regions of a
single brain as well as the relations among the areas of two distinct brains.
Graph analysis of hyper-brain networks constructed from the EEG scanning of 26
couples of individuals playing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma reveals the
possibility to predict non-cooperative interactions during the decision-making
phase. The hyper-brain networks of two-defector couples have significantly less
inter-brain links and overall higher modularity - i.e. the tendency to form two
separate subgraphs - than couples playing cooperative or tit-for-tat
strategies. The decision to defect can be "read" in advance by evaluating the
changes of connectivity pattern in the hyper-brain network.
