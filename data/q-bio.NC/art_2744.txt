Approximate Hubel-Wiesel Modules and the Data Structures of Neural
  Computation
This paper describes a framework for modeling the interface between
perception and memory on the algorithmic level of analysis. It is consistent
with phenomena associated with many different brain regions. These include
view-dependence (and invariance) effects in visual psychophysics and
inferotemporal cortex physiology, as well as episodic memory recall
interference effects associated with the medial temporal lobe. The perspective
developed here relies on a novel interpretation of Hubel and Wiesel's
conjecture for how receptive fields tuned to complex objects, and invariant to
details, could be achieved. It complements existing accounts of two-speed
learning systems in neocortex and hippocampus (e.g., McClelland et al. 1995)
while significantly expanding their scope to encompass a unified view of the
entire pathway from V1 to hippocampus.
