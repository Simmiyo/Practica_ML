Fourier Uniformity: An Useful Tool for Analyzing EEG Signals with An
  Application to Source Localization
If two signals are phase synchronous then the respective Fourier component at
each spectral band should exhibit certain properties. In a pair of artificially
generated phase synchronous signals the phase difference at each frequency band
changes very slowly over the subsequent frequency bands. This has been called
Fourier uniformity in this paper and a measure of it has been proposed. An
usefulness of this measure has been outlined in the case of cortical source
localization of scalp EEG.
