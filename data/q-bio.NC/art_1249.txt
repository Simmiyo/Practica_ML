The impact of epilepsy surgery on the structural connectome and its
  relation to outcome
Temporal lobe surgical resection brings seizure remission in up to 80% of
patients, with long-term complete seizure freedom in 41%. However, it is
unclear how surgery impacts on the structural white matter network, and how the
network changes relate to seizure outcome. We used white matter fibre
tractography on preoperative diffusion MRI to generate a structural white
matter network, and postoperative T1-weighted MRI to retrospectively infer the
impact of surgical resection on this network. We then applied graph theory and
machine learning to investigate the properties of change between the
preoperative and predicted postoperative networks. Temporal lobe surgery had a
modest impact on global network efficiency, despite the disruption caused. This
was due to alternative shortest paths in the network leading to widespread
increases in betweenness centrality post-surgery. Measurements of network
change could retrospectively predict seizure outcomes with 79% accuracy and 65%
specificity, which is twice as high as the empirical distribution. Fifteen
connections which changed due to surgery were identified as useful for
prediction of outcome, eight of which connected to the ipsilateral temporal
pole. Our results suggest that the use of network change metrics may have
clinical value for predicting seizure outcome. This approach could be used to
prospectively predict outcomes given a suggested resection mask using
preoperative data only.
