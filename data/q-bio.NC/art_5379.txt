Non-uniform state space reconstruction and coupling detection
We investigate the state space reconstruction from multiple time series
derived from continuous and discrete systems and propose a method for building
embedding vectors progressively using information measure criteria regarding
past, current and future states. The embedding scheme can be adapted for
different purposes, such as mixed modelling, cross-prediction and Granger
causality. In particular we apply this method in order to detect and evaluate
information transfer in coupled systems. As a practical application, we
investigate in records of scalp epileptic EEG the information flow across brain
areas.
