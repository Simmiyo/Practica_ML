Theory of cyborg: a new approach to fish locomotion control
Cyborg in the brain-machine interface field has attracted more attention in
recent years. To control a creature via a machine called cyborg method, three
stages are considerable: stimulation of neurons, neural response, and the
behavioral reaction of the subject. Our main concern was to know how electrical
stimulation induces neural activity and leads to a behavioral response.
Additionally, we were interested to explore which type of electrical
stimulation is optimal from different aspects such as maximum response with
minimum induction stimulus field, minimum damage of the tissue and the
electrode, reduction of the noxiousness of stimuli or pain in the living
creature. In this article, we proposed a new model for the induction of neural
activity led to locomotion responses through electrical stimulation.
Furthermore, based on this model, we developed a new approach of electrical
neural stimulation to provide a better locomotion control of living beings.
This approach was verified through the empirical data of fish cyborg. We
stimulated the fish brain by use of an ultra-high frequency signal which
careered by a random low frequency. According to our model, we could control
the locomotion of fish in a novel and innovative way. In this study, we
categorized the different cyborg methods based on the nervous system areas and
the stimulation signal properties to reach the better and optimal behavioral
control of creature. According to this, we proposed a new stimulation method
theoretically and confirmed it experimentally.
