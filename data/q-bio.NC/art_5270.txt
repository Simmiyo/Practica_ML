EURETILE D7.3 - Dynamic DAL benchmark coding, measurements on MPI
  version of DPSNN-STDP (distributed plastic spiking neural net) and
  improvements to other DAL codes
The EURETILE project required the selection and coding of a set of dedicated
benchmarks. The project is about the software and hardware architecture of
future many-tile distributed fault-tolerant systems. We focus on dynamic
workloads characterised by heavy numerical processing requirements. The
ambition is to identify common techniques that could be applied to both the
Embedded Systems and HPC domains. This document is the first public deliverable
of Work Package 7: Challenging Tiled Applications.
