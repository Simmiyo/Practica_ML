Threshold Disorder as a Source of Diverse and Complex Behavior in Random
  Nets
We study the diversity of complex spatio-temporal patterns in the behavior of
random synchronous asymmetric neural networks (RSANNs). Special attention is
given to the impact of disordered threshold values on limit-cycle diversity and
limit-cycle complexity in RSANNs which have `normal' thresholds by default.
Surprisingly, RSANNs exhibit only a small repertoire of rather complex
limit-cycle patterns when all parameters are fixed. This repertoire of complex
patterns is also rather stable with respect to small parameter changes. These
two unexpected results may generalize to the study of other complex systems. In
order to reach beyond this seemingly-disabling `stable and small' aspect of the
limit-cycle repertoire of RSANNs, we have found that if an RSANN has threshold
disorder above a critical level, then there is a rapid increase of the size of
the repertoire of patterns. The repertoire size initially follows a power-law
function of the magnitude of the threshold disorder. As the disorder increases
further, the limit-cycle patterns themselves become simpler until at a second
critical level most of the limit cycles become simple fixed points.
Nonetheless, for moderate changes in the threshold parameters, RSANNs are found
to display specific features of behavior desired for rapidly-responding
processing systems: accessibility to a large set of complex patterns.
