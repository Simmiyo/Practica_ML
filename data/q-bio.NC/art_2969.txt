CaMKII activation supports reward-based neural network optimization
  through Hamiltonian sampling
Synaptic plasticity is implemented and controlled through over thousand
different types of molecules in the postsynaptic density and presynaptic
boutons that assume a staggering array of different states through
phosporylation and other mechanisms. One of the most prominent molecule in the
postsynaptic density is CaMKII, that is described in molecular biology as a
"memory molecule" that can integrate through auto-phosporylation Ca-influx
signals on a relatively large time scale of dozens of seconds. The functional
impact of this memory mechanism is largely unknown. We show that the
experimental data on the specific role of CaMKII activation in dopamine-gated
spine consolidation suggest a general functional role in speeding up
reward-guided search for network configurations that maximize reward
expectation. Our theoretical analysis shows that stochastic search could in
principle even attain optimal network configurations by emulating one of the
most well-known nonlinear optimization methods, simulated annealing. But this
optimization is usually impeded by slowness of stochastic search at a given
temperature. We propose that CaMKII contributes a momentum term that
substantially speeds up this search. In particular, it allows the network to
overcome saddle points of the fitness function. The resulting improved
stochastic policy search can be understood on a more abstract level as
Hamiltonian sampling, which is known to be one of the most efficient stochastic
search methods.
