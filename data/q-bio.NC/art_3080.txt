AMIGOS: A Dataset for Affect, Personality and Mood Research on
  Individuals and Groups
We present AMIGOS-- A dataset for Multimodal research of affect, personality
traits and mood on Individuals and GrOupS. Different to other databases, we
elicited affect using both short and long videos in two social contexts, one
with individual viewers and one with groups of viewers. The database allows the
multimodal study of the affective responses, by means of neuro-physiological
signals of individuals in relation to their personality and mood, and with
respect to the social context and videos' duration. The data is collected in
two experimental settings. In the first one, 40 participants watched 16 short
emotional videos. In the second one, the participants watched 4 long videos,
some of them alone and the rest in groups. The participants' signals, namely,
Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Galvanic Skin Response
(GSR), were recorded using wearable sensors. Participants' frontal HD video and
both RGB and depth full body videos were also recorded. Participants emotions
have been annotated with both self-assessment of affective levels (valence,
arousal, control, familiarity, liking and basic emotions) felt during the
videos as well as external-assessment of levels of valence and arousal. We
present a detailed correlation analysis of the different dimensions as well as
baseline methods and results for single-trial classification of valence and
arousal, personality traits, mood and social context. The database is made
publicly available.
