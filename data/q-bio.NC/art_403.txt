The sign rule and beyond: Boundary effects, flexibility, and noise
  correlations in neural population codes
Over repeat presentations of the same stimulus, sensory neurons show variable
responses. This "noise" is typically correlated between pairs of cells, and a
question with rich history in neuroscience is how these noise correlations
impact the population's ability to encode the stimulus. Here, we consider a
very general setting for population coding, investigating how information
varies as a function of noise correlations, with all other aspects of the
problem - neural tuning curves, etc. - held fixed. This work yields unifying
insights into the role of noise correlations. These are summarized in the form
of theorems, and illustrated with numerical examples involving neurons with
diverse tuning curves. Our main contributions are as follows.
  (1) We generalize previous results to prove a sign rule (SR) - if noise
correlations between pairs of neurons have opposite signs vs. their signal
correlations, then coding performance will improve compared to the independent
case. This holds for three different metrics of coding performance, and for
arbitrary tuning curves and levels of heterogeneity. This generality is true
for our other results as well.
  (2) As also pointed out in the literature, the SR does not provide a
necessary condition for good coding. We show that a diverse set of correlation
structures can improve coding. Many of these violate the SR, as do
experimentally observed correlations. There is structure to this diversity: we
prove that the optimal correlation structures must lie on boundaries of the
possible set of noise correlations.
  (3) We provide a novel set of necessary and sufficient conditions, under
which the coding performance (in the presence of noise) will be as good as it
would be if there were no noise present at all.
