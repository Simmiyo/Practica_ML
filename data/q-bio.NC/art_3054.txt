An FFT-based Synchronization Approach to Recognize Human Behaviors using
  STN-LFP Signal
Classification of human behavior is key to developing closed-loop Deep Brain
Stimulation (DBS) systems, which may be able to decrease the power consumption
and side effects of the existing systems. Recent studies have shown that the
Local Field Potential (LFP) signals from both Subthalamic Nuclei (STN) of the
brain can be used to recognize human behavior. Since the DBS leads implanted in
each STN can collect three bipolar signals, the selection of a suitable pair of
LFPs that achieves optimal recognition performance is still an open problem to
address. Considering the presence of synchronized aggregate activity in the
basal ganglia, this paper presents an FFT-based synchronization approach to
automatically select a relevant pair of LFPs and use the pair together with an
SVM-based MKL classifier for behavior recognition purposes. Our experiments on
five subjects show the superiority of the proposed approach compared to other
methods used for behavior classification.
