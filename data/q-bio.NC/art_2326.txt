Applications of fMRI for Brain Mapping
Brain-mapping techniques have proven to be vital in understanding the
molecular, cellular, and functional mechanisms of the brain. Normal anatomical
imaging can provide structural information on certain abnormalities in the
brain. However there are many neurological disorders for which only structure
studies are not sufficient. In such cases it is required to investigate the
functional organization of the brain. Further it is necessary to study the
brain functions under normal as well as diseased conditions. Brain mapping
techniques can help in deriving useful and important information on these
issues. Brain functions and brain area responsible for the particular
activities like motor, sensory speech and memory process could be investigated.
The authors provide an overview of various Brain Mapping techniques and fMRI
signal processing methods.
