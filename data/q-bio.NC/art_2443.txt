Toward a Formal Model of the Shifting Relationship between Concepts and
  Contexts during Associative Thought
The quantum inspired State Context Property (SCOP) theory of concepts is
unique amongst theories of concepts in offering a means of incorporating that
for each concept in each different context there are an unlimited number of
exemplars, or states, of varying degrees of typicality. Working with data from
a study in which participants were asked to rate the typicality of exemplars of
a concept for different contexts, and introducing an exemplar typicality
threshold, we built a SCOP model of how states of a concept arise differently
in associative versus analytic (or divergent and convergent) modes of thought.
Introducing measures of state robustness and context relevance, we show that by
varying the threshold, the relevance of different contexts changes, and
seemingly atypical states can become typical. The formalism provides a pivotal
step toward a formal explanation of creative thought proesses.
