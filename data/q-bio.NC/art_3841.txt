Dynamical synapses causing self-organized criticality in neural networks
We show that a network of spiking neurons exhibits robust self-organized
criticality if the synaptic efficacies follow realistic dynamics. Deriving
analytical expressions for the average coupling strengths and inter-spike
intervals, we demonstrate that networks with dynamical synapses exhibit
critical avalanche dynamics for a wide range of interaction parameters. We
prove that in the thermodynamical limit the network becomes critical for all
large enough coupling parameters. We thereby explain experimental observations
in which cortical neurons show avalanche activity with the total intensity of
firing events being distributed as a power-law.
