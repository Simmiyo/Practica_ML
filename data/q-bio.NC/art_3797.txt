Intelligent encoding and economical communication in the visual stream
The theory of computational complexity is used to underpin a recent model of
neocortical sensory processing. We argue that encoding into reconstruction
networks is appealing for communicating agents using Hebbian learning and
working on hard combinatorial problems, which are easy to verify. Computational
definition of the concept of intelligence is provided. Simulations illustrate
the idea.
