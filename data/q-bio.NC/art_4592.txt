Memory shapes time perception and intertemporal choices
There is a consensus that human and non-human subjects experience temporal
distortions in many stages of their perceptual and decision-making systems.
Similarly, intertemporal choice research has shown that decision-makers
undervalue future outcomes relative to immediate ones. Here we combine
techniques from information theory and artificial intelligence to show how both
temporal distortions and intertemporal choice preferences can be explained as a
consequence of the coding efficiency of sensorimotor representation. In
particular, the model implies that interactions that constrain future behavior
are perceived as being both longer in duration and more valuable. Furthermore,
using simulations of artificial agents, we investigate how memory constraints
enforce a renormalization of the perceived timescales. Our results show that
qualitatively different discount functions, such as exponential and hyperbolic
discounting, arise as a consequence of an agent's probabilistic model of the
world.
