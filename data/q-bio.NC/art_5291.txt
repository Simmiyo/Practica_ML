A review of heterogeneous data mining for brain disorders
With rapid advances in neuroimaging techniques, the research on brain
disorder identification has become an emerging area in the data mining
community. Brain disorder data poses many unique challenges for data mining
research. For example, the raw data generated by neuroimaging experiments is in
tensor representations, with typical characteristics of high dimensionality,
structural complexity and nonlinear separability. Furthermore, brain
connectivity networks can be constructed from the tensor data, embedding subtle
interactions between brain regions. Other clinical measures are usually
available reflecting the disease status from different perspectives. It is
expected that integrating complementary information in the tensor data and the
brain network data, and incorporating other clinical parameters will be
potentially transformative for investigating disease mechanisms and for
informing therapeutic interventions. Many research efforts have been devoted to
this area. They have achieved great success in various applications, such as
tensor-based modeling, subgraph pattern mining, multi-view feature analysis. In
this paper, we review some recent data mining methods that are used for
analyzing brain disorders.
