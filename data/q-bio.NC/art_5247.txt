On spatial and temporal multilevel dynamics and scaling effects in
  epileptic seizures
Epileptic seizures are one of the most well-known dysfunctions of the nervous
system. During a seizure, a highly synchronized behavior of neural activity is
observed that can cause symptoms ranging from mild sensual malfunctions to the
complete loss of body control. In this paper, we aim to contribute towards a
better understanding of the dynamical systems phenomena that cause seizures.
Based on data analysis and modelling, seizure dynamics can be identified to
possess multiple spatial scales and on each spatial scale also multiple time
scales. At each scale, we reach several novel insights. On the smallest spatial
scale we consider single model neurons and investigate early-warning signs of
spiking. This introduces the theory of critical transitions to excitable
systems. For clusters of neurons (or neuronal regions) we use patient data and
find oscillatory behavior and new scaling laws near the seizure onset. These
scalings lead to substantiate the conjecture obtained from mean-field models
that a Hopf bifurcation could be involved near seizure onset. On the largest
spatial scale we introduce a measure based on phase-locking intervals and
wavelets into seizure modelling. It is used to resolve synchronization between
different regions in the brain and identifies time-shifted scaling laws at
different wavelet scales. We also compare our wavelet-based multiscale approach
with maximum linear cross-correlation and mean-phase coherence measures.
