Measuring and modeling the perception of natural and unconstrained gaze
  in humans and machines
Humans are remarkably adept at interpreting the gaze direction of other
individuals in their surroundings. This skill is at the core of the ability to
engage in joint visual attention, which is essential for establishing social
interactions. How accurate are humans in determining the gaze direction of
others in lifelike scenes, when they can move their heads and eyes freely, and
what are the sources of information for the underlying perceptual processes?
These questions pose a challenge from both empirical and computational
perspectives, due to the complexity of the visual input in real-life
situations. Here we measure empirically human accuracy in perceiving the gaze
direction of others in lifelike scenes, and study computationally the sources
of information and representations underlying this cognitive capacity. We show
that humans perform better in face-to-face conditions compared with recorded
conditions, and that this advantage is not due to the availability of input
dynamics. We further show that humans are still performing well when only the
eyes-region is visible, rather than the whole face. We develop a computational
model, which replicates the pattern of human performance, including the finding
that the eyes-region contains on its own, the required information for
estimating both head orientation and direction of gaze. Consistent with
neurophysiological findings on task-specific face regions in the brain, the
learned computational representations reproduce perceptual effects such as the
Wollaston illusion, when trained to estimate direction of gaze, but not when
trained to recognize objects or faces.
