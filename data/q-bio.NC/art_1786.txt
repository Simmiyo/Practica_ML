P-model Alternative to the T-model
Standard linguistic analysis of syntax uses the T-model. This model requires
the ordering: D-structure $>$ S-structure $>$ LF. Between each of these
representations there is movement which alters the order of the constituent
words; movement is achieved using the principles and parameters of syntactic
theory. Psychological serial models do not accommodate the T-model immediately
so that here a new model called the P-model is introduced. Here it is argued
that the LF representation should be replaced by a variant of Frege's three
qualities. In the F-representation the order of elements is not necessarily the
same as that in LF and it is suggested that the correct ordering is:
F-representation $>$ D-structure $>$ S-structure. Within this framework
movement originates as the outcome of emphasis applied to the sentence.
