Reconstructing Neural Parameters and Synapses of arbitrary
  interconnected Neurons from their Simulated Spiking Activity
To understand the behavior of a neural circuit it is a presupposition that we
have a model of the dynamical system describing this circuit. This model is
determined by several parameters, including not only the synaptic weights, but
also the parameters of each neuron. Existing works mainly concentrate on either
the synaptic weights or the neural parameters. In this paper we present an
algorithm to reconstruct all parameters including the synaptic weights of a
spiking neuron model. The model based on works of Eugene M. Izhikevich
(Izhikevich 2007) consists of two differential equations and covers different
types of cortical neurons. It combines the dynamical properties of
Hodgkin-Huxley-type dynamics with a high computational efficiency. The
presented algorithm uses the recordings of the corresponding membrane
potentials of the model for the reconstruction and consists of two main
components. The first component is a rank based Genetic Algorithm (GA) which is
used to find the neural parameters of the model. The second one is a Least Mean
Squares approach which computes the synaptic weights of all interconnected
neurons by minimizing the squared error between the calculated and the measured
membrane potentials for each time step. In preparation for the reconstruction
of the neural parameters and of the synaptic weights from real measured
membrane potentials, promising results based on simulated data generated with a
randomly parametrized Izhikevich model are presented. The reconstruction does
not only converge to a global minimum of neural parameters, but also
approximates the synaptic weights with high precision.
