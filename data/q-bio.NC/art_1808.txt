Understanding visual map formation through vortex dynamics of spin
  Hamiltonian models
The pattern formation in orientation and ocular dominance columns is one of
the most investigated problems in the brain. From a known cortical structure,
we build spin-like Hamiltonian models with long-range interactions of the
Mexican hat type. These Hamiltonian models allow a coherent interpretation of
the diverse phenomena in the visual map formation with the help of relaxation
dynamics of spin systems. In particular, we explain various phenomena of
self-organization in orientation and ocular dominance map formation including
the pinwheel annihilation and its dependency on the columnar wave vector and
boundary conditions.
