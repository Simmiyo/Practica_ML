Design for a Darwinian Brain: Part 1. Philosophy and Neuroscience
Physical symbol systems are needed for open-ended cognition. A good way to
understand physical symbol systems is by comparison of thought to chemistry.
Both have systematicity, productivity and compositionality. The state of the
art in cognitive architectures for open-ended cognition is critically assessed.
I conclude that a cognitive architecture that evolves symbol structures in the
brain is a promising candidate to explain open-ended cognition. Part 2 of the
paper presents such a cognitive architecture.
