A Brand-new Research Method of Neuroendocrine System
In this paper, we present the empirical investigation results on the
neuroendocrine system by bipartite graphs. This neuroendocrine network model
can describe the structural characteristic of neuroendocrine system. The act
degree distribution and cumulate act degree distribution show so-called shifted
power law-SPL function forms. In neuroendocrine network, the act degree stands
for the number of the cells that secretes a single mediator, in which
bFGF(basic fibroblast growth factor) is the largest node act degree. It is an
important mitogenic cytokine, followed by TGF-beta, IL-6, IL1-beta, VEGF,
IGF-1and so on. They are critical in neuroendocrine system to maintain bodily
healthiness, emotional stabilization and endocrine harmony. The average act
degree of neuroendocrine network is h = 3.01, It means each mediator is
secreted by three cells on an average . The similarity that stand for the
average probability of secreting the same mediators by all the neuroendocrine
cells is s = 0.14. Our results may be used in the research of the medical
treatment of neuroendocrine diseases.
