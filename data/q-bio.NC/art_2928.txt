TrueHappiness: Neuromorphic Emotion Recognition on TrueNorth
We present an approach to constructing a neuromorphic device that responds to
language input by producing neuron spikes in proportion to the strength of the
appropriate positive or negative emotional response. Specifically, we perform a
fine-grained sentiment analysis task with implementations on two different
systems: one using conventional spiking neural network (SNN) simulators and the
other one using IBM's Neurosynaptic System TrueNorth. Input words are projected
into a high-dimensional semantic space and processed through a fully-connected
neural network (FCNN) containing rectified linear units trained via
backpropagation. After training, this FCNN is converted to a SNN by
substituting the ReLUs with integrate-and-fire neurons. We show that there is
practically no performance loss due to conversion to a spiking network on a
sentiment analysis test set, i.e. correlations between predictions and human
annotations differ by less than 0.02 comparing the original DNN and its spiking
equivalent. Additionally, we show that the SNN generated with this technique
can be mapped to existing neuromorphic hardware -- in our case, the TrueNorth
chip. Mapping to the chip involves 4-bit synaptic weight discretization and
adjustment of the neuron thresholds. The resulting end-to-end system can take a
user input, i.e. a word in a vocabulary of over 300,000 words, and estimate its
sentiment on TrueNorth with a power consumption of approximately 50 uW.
