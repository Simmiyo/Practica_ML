Suppléance perceptive par électro-stimulation linguale embarquée :
  perspectives pour la prévention des escarres chez le blessé médullaire
We introduce the innovative technologies, based on the concept of "sensory
substitution", we are developing in the fields of biomedical engineering and
human disability. Precisely, our goal is to design, develop and validate
practical assistive biomedical and/or technical devices and/or rehabilitating
procedures for persons with disabilities, using artificial tongue-placed
tactile biofeedback systems. This paper proposes an application for pressure
sores prevention in case of spinal cord injuries (persons with paraplegia, or
tetraplegia).
