Improving the Entropy Estimate of Neuronal Firings of Modeled Cochlear
  Nucleus Neurons
In this correspondence information theoretical tools are used to investigate
the statistical properties of modeled cochlear nucleus globular bushy cell
spike trains. The firing patterns are obtained from a simulation software that
generates sample spike trains from any auditory input. Here we analyze for the
first time the responses of globular bushy cells to voiced and unvoiced speech
sounds. Classical entropy estimates, such as the direct method, are improved
upon by considering a time-varying and time-dependent entropy estimate. With
this method we investigated the relationship between the predictability of the
neuronal response and the frequency content in the auditory signals. The
analysis quantifies the temporal precision of the neuronal coding and the
memory in the neuronal response.
