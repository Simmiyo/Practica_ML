Dynamical criticality in the collective activity of a population of
  retinal neurons
Recent experimental results based on multi-electrode and imaging techniques
have reinvigorated the idea that large neural networks operate near a critical
point, between order and disorder. However, evidence for criticality has relied
on the definition of arbitrary order parameters, or on models that do not
address the dynamical nature of network activity. Here we introduce a novel
approach to assess criticality that overcomes these limitations, while
encompassing and generalizing previous criteria. We find a simple model to
describe the global activity of large populations of ganglion cells in the rat
retina, and show that their statistics are poised near a critical point. Taking
into account the temporal dynamics of the activity greatly enhances the
evidence for criticality, revealing it where previous methods would not. The
approach is general and could be used in other biological networks.
