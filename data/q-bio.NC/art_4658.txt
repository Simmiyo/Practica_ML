Predicting brain age with deep learning from raw imaging data results in
  a reliable and heritable biomarker
Machine learning analysis of neuroimaging data can accurately predict
chronological age in healthy people and deviations from healthy brain ageing
have been associated with cognitive impairment and disease. Here we sought to
further establish the credentials of "brain-predicted age" as a biomarker of
individual differences in the brain ageing process, using a predictive
modelling approach based on deep learning, and specifically convolutional
neural networks (CNN), and applied to both pre-processed and raw T1-weighted
MRI data. Firstly, we aimed to demonstrate the accuracy of CNN brain-predicted
age using a large dataset of healthy adults (N = 2001). Next, we sought to
establish the heritability of brain-predicted age using a sample of monozygotic
and dizygotic female twins (N = 62). Thirdly, we examined the test-retest and
multi-centre reliability of brain-predicted age using two samples
(within-scanner N = 20; between-scanner N = 11). CNN brain-predicted ages were
generated and compared to a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) approach, on all
datasets. Input data were grey matter (GM) or white matter (WM) volumetric maps
generated by Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) or raw data. Brain-predicted
age represents an accurate, highly reliable and genetically-valid phenotype,
that has potential to be used as a biomarker of brain ageing. Moreover, age
predictions can be accurately generated on raw T1-MRI data, substantially
reducing computation time for novel data, bringing the process closer to giving
real-time information on brain health in clinical settings.
