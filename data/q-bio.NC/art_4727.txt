Sharing deep generative representation for perceived image
  reconstruction from human brain activity
Decoding human brain activities via functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) has gained increasing attention in recent years. While encouraging
results have been reported in brain states classification tasks, reconstructing
the details of human visual experience still remains difficult. Two main
challenges that hinder the development of effective models are the perplexing
fMRI measurement noise and the high dimensionality of limited data instances.
Existing methods generally suffer from one or both of these issues and yield
dissatisfactory results. In this paper, we tackle this problem by casting the
reconstruction of visual stimulus as the Bayesian inference of missing view in
a multiview latent variable model. Sharing a common latent representation, our
joint generative model of external stimulus and brain response is not only
"deep" in extracting nonlinear features from visual images, but also powerful
in capturing correlations among voxel activities of fMRI recordings. The
nonlinearity and deep structure endow our model with strong representation
ability, while the correlations of voxel activities are critical for
suppressing noise and improving prediction. We devise an efficient variational
Bayesian method to infer the latent variables and the model parameters. To
further improve the reconstruction accuracy, the latent representations of
testing instances are enforced to be close to that of their neighbours from the
training set via posterior regularization. Experiments on three fMRI recording
datasets demonstrate that our approach can more accurately reconstruct visual
stimuli.
