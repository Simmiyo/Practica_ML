Does consciousness really collapse the wave function? A possible
  objective biophysical resolution of the measurement problem
An analysis has been performed of the theories and postulates advanced by von
Neumann, London and Bauer, and Wigner, concerning the role that consciousness
might play in the collapse of the wave function, which has become known as the
measurement problem. This reveals that an error may have been made by them in
the area of biology and its interface with quantum mechanics, when they called
for the reduction of any superposition states in the brain through the mind or
consciousness. Many years later Wigner changed his mind to reflect a simpler
and more realistic objective position, expanded upon by Shimony, which appears
to offer a way to resolve this issue. The argument is therefore made that the
wave function of any superposed photon state or states is always objectively
changed within the complex architecture of the eye in a continuous linear
process initially for most of the superposed photons, followed by a
discontinuous nonlinear collapse process later for any remaining superposed
photons, thereby guaranteeing that only final, measured information is
presented to the brain, mind or consciousness. An experiment to be conducted in
the near future may enable us to simultaneously resolve the measurement problem
and also determine if the linear nature of quantum mechanics is violated by the
perceptual process.
