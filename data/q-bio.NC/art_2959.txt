Advantages of EEG phase patterns for the detection of gait intention in
  healthy and stroke subjects
One use of EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) in rehabilitation is
the detection of movement intention. In this paper we investigate for the first
time the instantaneous phase of movement related cortical potential (MRCP) and
its application to the detection of gait intention. We demonstrate the utility
of MRCP phase in two independent datasets, in which 10 healthy subjects and 9
chronic stroke patients executed a self-initiated gait task in three sessions.
Phase features were compared to more conventional amplitude and power features.
The neurophysiology analysis showed that phase features have higher
signal-to-noise ratio than the other features. Also, BCI detectors of gait
intention based on phase, amplitude, and their combination were evaluated under
three conditions: session specific calibration, intersession transfer, and
intersubject transfer. Results show that the phase based detector is the most
accurate for session specific calibration (movement intention was correctly
detected in 66.5% of trials in healthy subjects, and in 63.3% in stroke
patients). However, in intersession and intersubject transfer, the detector
that combines amplitude and phase features is the most accurate one and the
only that retains its accuracy (62.5% in healthy subjects and 59% in stroke
patients) w.r.t. session specific calibration. Thus, MRCP phase features
improve the detection of gait intention and could be used in practice to remove
time-consuming BCI recalibration.
