Multimodal transition and stochastic antiresonance in squid giant axons
The experimental data of N. Takahashi, Y. Hanyu, T. Musha, R. Kubo, and G.
Matsumoto, Physica D \textbf{43}, 318 (1990), on the response of squid giant
axons stimulated by periodic sequence of short current pulses is interpreted
within the Hodgkin-Huxley model. The minimum of the firing rate as a function
of the stimulus amplitude $I_0$ in the high-frequency regime is due to the
multimodal transition. Below this singular point only odd multiples of the
driving period remain and the system is highly sensitive to noise. The
coefficient of variation has a maximum and the firing rate has a minimum as a
function of the noise intensity which is an indication of the stochastic
coherence antiresonance. The model calculations reproduce the frequency of
occurrence of the most common modes in the vicinity of the transition. A linear
relation of output frequency vs. $I_0$ for above the transition is also
confirmed.
