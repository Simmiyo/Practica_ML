Graph analysis of functional brain networks: practical issues in
  translational neuroscience
The brain can be regarded as a network: a connected system where nodes, or
units, represent different specialized regions and links, or connections,
represent communication pathways. From a functional perspective communication
is coded by temporal dependence between the activities of different brain
areas. In the last decade, the abstract representation of the brain as a graph
has allowed to visualize functional brain networks and describe their
non-trivial topological properties in a compact and objective way. Nowadays,
the use of graph analysis in translational neuroscience has become essential to
quantify brain dysfunctions in terms of aberrant reconfiguration of functional
brain networks. Despite its evident impact, graph analysis of functional brain
networks is not a simple toolbox that can be blindly applied to brain signals.
On the one hand, it requires a know-how of all the methodological steps of the
processing pipeline that manipulates the input brain signals and extract the
functional network properties. On the other hand, a knowledge of the neural
phenomenon under study is required to perform physiological-relevant analysis.
The aim of this review is to provide practical indications to make sense of
brain network analysis and contrast counterproductive attitudes.
