The specificity and robustness of long-distance connections in weighted,
  interareal connectomes
Brain areas' functional repertoires are shaped by their incoming and outgoing
structural connections. In empirically measured networks, most connections are
short, reflecting spatial and energetic constraints. Nonetheless, a small
number of connections span long distances, consistent with the notion that the
functionality of these connections must outweigh their cost. While the precise
function of these long-distance connections is not known, the leading
hypothesis is that they act to reduce the topological distance between brain
areas and facilitate efficient interareal communication. However, this
hypothesis implies a non-specificity of long-distance connections that we
contend is unlikely. Instead, we propose that long-distance connections serve
to diversify brain areas' inputs and outputs, thereby promoting complex
dynamics. Through analysis of five interareal network datasets, we show that
long-distance connections play only minor roles in reducing average interareal
topological distance. In contrast, areas' long-distance and short-range
neighbors exhibit marked differences in their connectivity profiles, suggesting
that long-distance connections enhance dissimilarity between regional inputs
and outputs. Next, we show that -- in isolation -- areas' long-distance
connectivity profiles exhibit non-random levels of similarity, suggesting that
the communication pathways formed by long connections exhibit redundancies that
may serve to promote robustness. Finally, we use a linearization of
Wilson-Cowan dynamics to simulate the covariance structure of neural activity
and show that in the absence of long-distance connections, a common measure of
functional diversity decreases. Collectively, our findings suggest that
long-distance connections are necessary for supporting diverse and complex
brain dynamics.
