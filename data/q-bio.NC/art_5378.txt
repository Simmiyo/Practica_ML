Towards Google matrix of brain
We apply the approach of the Google matrix, used in computer science and
World Wide Web, to description of properties of neuronal networks. The Google
matrix ${\bf G}$ is constructed on the basis of neuronal network of a brain
model discussed in PNAS {\bf 105}, 3593 (2008). We show that the spectrum of
eigenvalues of ${\bf G}$ has a gapless structure with long living relaxation
modes. The PageRank of the network becomes delocalized for certain values of
the Google damping factor $\alpha$. The properties of other eigenstates are
also analyzed. We discuss further parallels and similarities between the World
Wide Web and neuronal networks.
