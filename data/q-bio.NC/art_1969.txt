Non Markovian Noise mediated through Anamolous Diffusion within Ion
  Channels
It is quite clear from a wide range of experiments that gating phenomena of
ion channels is inherently stochastic. It has been discussed using BD
simulations in a recent paper that memory effects in ion transport is
negligible, unless the barrier height is high. In this brief report we like to
state using Differential Stochastic Methods (DSM's) that the Markovian property
of exponential dwell times do indeed give rise to a high barrier, which in turn
indicates that memory effects need not be ignored. We have thus constructed a
Generalized Langevin Equation which contains a combination of Non Markovian at
different time scales & Markovian processes and develop an algorithm to
describe the scheme of events. We see that the oscillatory function behaviour
with exponential decay is obtained in the Markovian limit and two distinct time
scales corresponding to the processes of diffusion & drift may be obtained from
preliminary simulation results. We propose that the results need much more
inspection and it will be worthwhile to reproduce using MD simulations. The
most important idea which we like to propose in this paper is that the rise of
time scales and memory effects may be inherently related to the differential
behaviour of shear viscosity in the cytoplasm & extracellular matrix.
