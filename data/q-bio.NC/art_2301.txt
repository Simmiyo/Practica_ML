Invariance of visual operations at the level of receptive fields
Receptive field profiles registered by cell recordings have shown that
mammalian vision has developed receptive fields tuned to different sizes and
orientations in the image domain as well as to different image velocities in
space-time. This article presents a theoretical model by which families of
idealized receptive field profiles can be derived mathematically from a small
set of basic assumptions that correspond to structural properties of the
environment. The article also presents a theory for how basic invariance
properties to variations in scale, viewing direction and relative motion can be
obtained from the output of such receptive fields, using complementary
selection mechanisms that operate over the output of families of receptive
fields tuned to different parameters. Thereby, the theory shows how basic
invariance properties of a visual system can be obtained already at the level
of receptive fields, and we can explain the different shapes of receptive field
profiles found in biological vision from a requirement that the visual system
should be invariant to the natural types of image transformations that occur in
its environment.
