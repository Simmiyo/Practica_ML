Advanced statistical methods for eye movement analysis and modeling: a
  gentle introduction
In this Chapter we show that by considering eye movements, and in particular,
the resulting sequence of gaze shifts, a stochastic process, a wide variety of
tools become available for analyses and modelling beyond conventional
statistical methods. Such tools encompass random walk analyses and more complex
techniques borrowed from the pattern recognition and machine learning fields.
  After a brief, though critical, probabilistic tour of current computational
models of eye movements and visual attention, we lay down the basis for gaze
shift pattern analysis. To this end, the concepts of Markov Processes, the
Wiener process and related random walks within the Gaussian framework of the
Central Limit Theorem will be introduced. Then, we will deliberately violate
fundamental assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem to elicit a larger
perspective, rooted in statistical physics, for analysing and modelling eye
movements in terms of anomalous, non-Gaussian, random walks and modern foraging
theory.
  Eventually, by resorting to machine learning techniques, we discuss how the
analyses of movement patterns can develop into the inference of hidden patterns
of the mind: inferring the observer's task, assessing cognitive impairments,
classifying expertise.
