Searching for collective behavior in a small brain
In large neuronal networks, it is believed that functions emerge through the
collective behavior of many interconnected neurons. Recently, the development
of experimental techniques that allow simultaneous recording of calcium
concentration from a large fraction of all neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans -
a nematode with 302 neurons - creates the opportunity to ask if such emergence
is universal, reaching down to even the smallest brains. Here, we measure the
activity of 50+ neurons in C. elegans, and analyze the data by building the
maximum entropy model that matches the mean activity and pairwise correlations
among these neurons. To capture the graded nature of the cells' responses, we
assign each cell multiple states. These models, which are equivalent to a
family of Potts glasses, successfully predict higher statistical structure in
the network. In addition, these models exhibit signatures of collective
behavior: the state of single cells can be predicted from the state of the rest
of the network; the network, despite being sparse in a way similar to the
structural connectome, distributes its response globally when locally
perturbed; the distribution over network states has multiple local maxima, as
in models for memory; and the parameters that describe the real network are
close to a critical surface in this family of models.
