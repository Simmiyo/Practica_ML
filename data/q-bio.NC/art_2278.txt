Haptic BCI Paradigm based on Somatosensory Evoked Potential
A new concept and an online prototype of haptic BCI paradigm are presented.
Our main goal is to develop a new, alternative and low cost paradigm, with
open-source hardware and software components. We also report results obtained
with the novel dry EEG electrodes based signal acquisition system by g.tec,
which further improves experimental comfort. We address the following points: a
novel application of the BCI; a new methodological approach used compared to
earlier projects; a new benefit for potential users of a BCI; the approach
working online/in real-time; development of a novel stimuli delivery hardware
and software. The results with five healthy subjects and discussion of future
developments conclude this submission.
