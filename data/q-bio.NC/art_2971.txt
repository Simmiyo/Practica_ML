Grid-like structure is optimal for path integration
Grid cells in medial entorhinal cortex are believed to play a key role in
path integration. However, the relation between path integration and the
grid-like arrangement of their firing field remains unclear. We provide
theoretical evidence that grid-like structure and path integration are closely
related. In one dimension, the grid-like structure provides the optimal
solution for path integration assuming that the noise correlation structure is
Gaussian. In two dimensions, assuming that the noise is Gaussian, rectangular
grid-like structure is the optimal solution provided that 1- both noise
correlation and receptive field structures of the neurons can be
multiplicatively decomposed into orthogonal components and 2- the eigenvalues
of the decomposed correlation matrices decrease faster than the square of the
frequency of the corresponding eigenvectors. We will also address the decoding
mechanism and show that the problem of decoding reduces to the problem of
extracting task relevant information in the presence of task irrelevant
information. Change-based Population Coding provides the optimal solution for
this problem.
