Synchronization of coupled limit cycles
A unified approach for analyzing synchronization in coupled systems of
autonomous differential equations is presented in this work. Through a careful
analysis of the variational equation of the coupled system we establish a
sufficient condition for synchronization in terms of the geometric properties
of the local limit cycles and the coupling operator. This result applies to a
large class of differential equation models in physics and biology. The
stability analysis is complemented with a discussion of numerical simulations
of a compartmental model of a neuron.
