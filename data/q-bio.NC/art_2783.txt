Linking structure and activity in nonlinear spiking networks
Recent experimental advances are producing an avalanche of data on both
neural connectivity and neural activity. To take full advantage of these two
emerging datasets we need a framework that links them, revealing how collective
neural activity arises from the structure of neural connectivity and intrinsic
neural dynamics. This problem of {\it structure-driven activity} has drawn
major interest in computational neuroscience. Existing methods for relating
activity and architecture in spiking networks rely on linearizing activity
around a central operating point and thus fail to capture the nonlinear
responses of individual neurons that are the hallmark of neural information
processing. Here, we overcome this limitation and present a new relationship
between connectivity and activity in networks of nonlinear spiking neurons by
developing a diagrammatic fluctuation expansion based on statistical field
theory. We explicitly show how recurrent network structure produces pairwise
and higher-order correlated activity, and how nonlinearities impact the
networks' spiking activity. Our findings open new avenues to investigating how
single-neuron nonlinearities---including those of different cell
types---combine with connectivity to shape population activity and function.
