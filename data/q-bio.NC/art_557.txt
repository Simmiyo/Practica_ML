Convolution Metric for Neuron Membrane Potential Recordings
I provide a convolution metric which takes neural membrane potential
recordings as arguments and compares their subthreshold features along with the
timing and number of spikes within them--summarizing differences in these with
a single "distance" between the recordings. Based on van Rossum's 2001 metric
for spike trains, the metric relies on a convolution operation that it performs
on the input data. The kernel used for the convolution is carefully chosen such
that it produces a desirable frequency space response and, unlike van Rossum's
kernel, causes the metric to be first order both in differences between nearby
spike times and in differences between same-time membrane potential values: an
important trait. 31 pages, 4 figures.
