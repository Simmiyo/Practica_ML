A novel plasticity rule can explain the development of sensorimotor
  intelligence
Grounding autonomous behavior in the nervous system is a fundamental
challenge for neuroscience. In particular, the self-organized behavioral
development provides more questions than answers. Are there special functional
units for curiosity, motivation, and creativity? This paper argues that these
features can be grounded in synaptic plasticity itself, without requiring any
higher level constructs. We propose differential extrinsic plasticity (DEP) as
a new synaptic rule for self-learning systems and apply it to a number of
complex robotic systems as a test case. Without specifying any purpose or goal,
seemingly purposeful and adaptive behavior is developed, displaying a certain
level of sensorimotor intelligence. These surprising results require no system
specific modifications of the DEP rule but arise rather from the underlying
mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking due to the tight
brain-body-environment coupling. The new synaptic rule is biologically
plausible and it would be an interesting target for a neurobiolocal
investigation. We also argue that this neuronal mechanism may have been a
catalyst in natural evolution.
