Sparse Codes for Speech Predict Spectrotemporal Receptive Fields in the
  Inferior Colliculus
We have developed a sparse mathematical representation of speech that
minimizes the number of active model neurons needed to represent typical speech
sounds. The model learns several well-known acoustic features of speech such as
harmonic stacks, formants, onsets and terminations, but we also find more
exotic structures in the spectrogram representation of sound such as localized
checkerboard patterns and frequency-modulated excitatory subregions flanked by
suppressive sidebands. Moreover, several of these novel features resemble
neuronal receptive fields reported in the Inferior Colliculus (IC), as well as
auditory thalamus and cortex, and our model neurons exhibit the same tradeoff
in spectrotemporal resolution as has been observed in IC. To our knowledge,
this is the first demonstration that receptive fields of neurons in the
ascending mammalian auditory pathway beyond the auditory nerve can be predicted
based on coding principles and the statistical properties of recorded sounds.
