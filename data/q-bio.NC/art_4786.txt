Spiking neurons with short-term synaptic plasticity form superior
  generative networks
Spiking networks that perform probabilistic inference have been proposed both
as models of cortical computation and as candidates for solving problems in
machine learning. However, the evidence for spike-based computation being in
any way superior to non-spiking alternatives remains scarce. We propose that
short-term plasticity can provide spiking networks with distinct computational
advantages compared to their classical counterparts. In this work, we use
networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons that are trained to perform both
discriminative and generative tasks in their forward and backward information
processing paths, respectively. During training, the energy landscape
associated with their dynamics becomes highly diverse, with deep attractor
basins separated by high barriers. Classical algorithms solve this problem by
employing various tempering techniques, which are both computationally
demanding and require global state updates. We demonstrate how similar results
can be achieved in spiking networks endowed with local short-term synaptic
plasticity. Additionally, we discuss how these networks can even outperform
tempering-based approaches when the training data is imbalanced. We thereby
show how biologically inspired, local, spike-triggered synaptic dynamics based
simply on a limited pool of synaptic resources can allow spiking networks to
outperform their non-spiking relatives.
