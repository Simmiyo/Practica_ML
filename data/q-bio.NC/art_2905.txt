Simulating Brain Reaction to Methamphetamine Regarding Consumer
  Personality
Addiction, as a nervous disease, can be analysed using mathematical modelling
and computer simulations. In this paper, we use an existing mathematical model
to predict and simulate human brain response to the consumption of a single
dose of methamphetamine. The model is implemented and coded in Matlab. Three
types of personalities including introverts, ambiverts and extroverts are
studied. The parameters of the mathematical model are calibrated and optimized,
according to psychological theories, using a real coded genetic algorithm. The
simulations show significant correlation between people response to
methamphetamine abuse and their personality. They also show that one of the
causes of tendency to stimulants roots in consumers personality traits. The
results can be used as a tool for reducing attitude towards addiction.
