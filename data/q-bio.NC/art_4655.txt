A Searchlight Factor Model Approach for Locating Shared Information in
  Multi-Subject fMRI Analysis
There is a growing interest in joint multi-subject fMRI analysis. The
challenge of such analysis comes from inherent anatomical and functional
variability across subjects. One approach to resolving this is a shared
response factor model. This assumes a shared and time synchronized stimulus
across subjects. Such a model can often identify shared information, but it may
not be able to pinpoint with high resolution the spatial location of this
information. In this work, we examine a searchlight based shared response model
to identify shared information in small contiguous regions (searchlights)
across the whole brain. Validation using classification tasks demonstrates that
we can pinpoint informative local regions.
