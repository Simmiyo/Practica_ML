Splay states in finite pulse-coupled networks of excitable neurons
The emergence and stability of splay states is studied in fully coupled
finite networks of N excitable quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons, connected
via synapses modeled as pulses of finite amplitude and duration. For such
synapses, by introducing two distinct types of synaptic events (pulse emission
and termination), we were able to write down an exact event-driven map for the
system and to evaluate the splay state solutions. For M overlapping post
synaptic potentials the linear stability analysis of the splay state should
take in account, besides the actual values of the membrane potentials, also the
firing times associated to the M previous pulse emissions. As a matter of fact,
it was possible, by introducing M complementary variables, to rephrase the
evolution of the network as an event-driven map and to derive an analytic
expression for the Floquet spectrum. We find that, independently of M, the
splay state is marginally stable with N-2 neutral directions. Furthermore, we
have identified a family of periodic solutions surrounding the splay state and
sharing the same neutral stability directions. In the limit of $\delta$-pulses,
it is still possible to derive an event-driven formulation for the dynamics,
however the number of neutrally stable directions, associated to the splay
state, becomes N. Finally, we prove a link between the results for our system
and a previous theory [Watanabe and Strogatz, Physica D, 74 (1994), pp. 197-
253] developed for networks of phase oscillators with sinusoidal coupling.
