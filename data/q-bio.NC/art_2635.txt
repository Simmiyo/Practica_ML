Separable time-causal and time-recursive spatio-temporal receptive
  fields
We present an improved model and theory for time-causal and time-recursive
spatio-temporal receptive fields, obtained by a combination of Gaussian
receptive fields over the spatial domain and first-order integrators or
equivalently truncated exponential filters coupled in cascade over the temporal
domain. Compared to previous spatio-temporal scale-space formulations in terms
of non-enhancement of local extrema or scale invariance, these receptive fields
are based on different scale-space axiomatics over time by ensuring
non-creation of new local extrema or zero-crossings with increasing temporal
scale. Specifically, extensions are presented about parameterizing the
intermediate temporal scale levels, analysing the resulting temporal dynamics
and transferring the theory to a discrete implementation in terms of recursive
filters over time.
