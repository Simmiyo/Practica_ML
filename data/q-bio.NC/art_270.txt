BEM-based SMS-LORETA - an advanced method to localize multiple
  simultaneously active sources in the cerebral cortex
In this paper the method and performance data of 'Boundary Element Method
(BEM)'-based SMS-LORETA (Simultaneous Multiple Sources LORETA) are presented.
According to these data the method is capable of locating efficiently multiple
simultaneously active neural sources from scalp potential topographies
automatically. BEM-based SMS-LORETA is a procedure to fully interpret sLORETA
solutions, i.e., with a given scalp potential distribution it gives the number
of identifiable sources as well as their strength and orientation. Performance
data result from numerous analyses of simulated noise-free and
noise-contaminated potential distributions (topographies) that have been
obtained by means of BEM-based forward solutions, where one, two or three
simultaneously active dipoles were randomly chosen regarding their positions
and polarity.
