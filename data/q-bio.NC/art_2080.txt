Some considerations on how the human brain must be arranged in order to
  make its replication in a thinking machine possible
For the most of my life, I have earned my living as a computer vision
professional busy with image processing tasks and problems. In the computer
vision community there is a widespread belief that artificial vision systems
faithfully replicate human vision abilities or at least very closely mimic
them. It was a great surprise to me when one day I have realized that computer
and human vision have next to nothing in common. The former is occupied with
extensive data processing, carrying out massive pixel-based calculations, while
the latter is busy with meaningful information processing, concerned with smart
objects-based manipulations. And the gap between the two is insurmountable. To
resolve this confusion, I had had to return and revaluate first the vision
phenomenon itself, define more carefully what visual information is and how to
treat it properly. In this work I have not been, as it is usually accepted,
biologically inspired . On the contrary, I have drawn my inspirations from a
pure mathematical theory, the Kolmogorov s complexity theory. The results of my
work have been already published elsewhere. So the objective of this paper is
to try and apply the insights gained in course of this my enterprise to a more
general case of information processing in human brain and the challenging issue
of human intelligence.
