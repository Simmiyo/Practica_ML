A Theory of Consciousness Founded on Neurons That Behave Like Qubits
This paper presents a hypothesis that consciousness is a natural result of
neurons that become connected recursively, and work synchronously between short
and long term memories. Such neurons demonstrate qubit-like properties, each
supporting a probabilistic combination of true and false at a given phase.
Advantages of qubits include probabilistic modifications of cues for searching
associations in long term memory, and controlled toggling for parallel,
reversible computations to prioritize multiple recalls and to facilitate
mathematical abilities.
