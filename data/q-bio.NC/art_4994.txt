Communication and Information Theory of Single Action Potential Signals
  in Plants
Many plants, such as Mimosa pudica (the sensitive plant), employ
electrochemical signals known as action potentials (APs) for rapid
intercellular communication. In this paper, we consider a reaction diffusion
model of individual AP signals to analyze APs from a communication and
information theoretic perspective. We use concepts from molecular communication
to explain the underlying process of information transfer in a plant for a
single AP pulse that is shared with one or more receiver cells. We also use the
chemical Langevin equation to accommodate the deterministic as well as
stochastic component of the system. Finally we present an information theoretic
analysis of single action potentials, obtaining achievable information rates
for these signals. We show that, in general, the presence of an AP signal can
increase the mutual information and information propagation speed among
neighboring cells with receivers in different settings.
