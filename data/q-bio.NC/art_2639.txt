An New Type Of Artificial Brain Using Controlled Neurons
Plans for a new type of artificial brain are possible because of realistic
neurons in logically structured arrays of controlled toggles, one toggle per
neuron. Controlled toggles can be made to compute, in parallel, parameters of
critical importance for each of several complex images recalled from
associative long term memory. Controlled toggles are shown below to amount to a
new type of neural network that supports autonomous behavior and action.
