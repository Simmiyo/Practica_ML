Nonlinear Hebbian learning as a unifying principle in receptive field
  formation
The development of sensory receptive fields has been modeled in the past by a
variety of models including normative models such as sparse coding or
independent component analysis and bottom-up models such as spike-timing
dependent plasticity or the Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro model of synaptic
plasticity. Here we show that the above variety of approaches can all be
unified into a single common principle, namely Nonlinear Hebbian Learning. When
Nonlinear Hebbian Learning is applied to natural images, receptive field shapes
were strongly constrained by the input statistics and preprocessing, but
exhibited only modest variation across different choices of nonlinearities in
neuron models or synaptic plasticity rules. Neither overcompleteness nor sparse
network activity are necessary for the development of localized receptive
fields. The analysis of alternative sensory modalities such as auditory models
or V2 development lead to the same conclusions. In all examples, receptive
fields can be predicted a priori by reformulating an abstract model as
nonlinear Hebbian learning. Thus nonlinear Hebbian learning and natural
statistics can account for many aspects of receptive field formation across
models and sensory modalities.
