Flow-based network analysis of the Caenorhabditis elegans connectome
We exploit flow propagation on the directed neuronal network of the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans to reveal dynamically relevant features of its
connectome. We find flow-based groupings of neurons at different levels of
granularity, which we relate to functional and anatomical constituents of its
nervous system. A systematic in silico evaluation of the full set of single and
double neuron ablations is used to identify deletions that induce the most
severe disruptions of the multi-resolution flow structure. Such ablations are
linked to functionally relevant neurons, and suggest potential candidates for
further in vivo investigation. In addition, we use the directional patterns of
incoming and outgoing network flows at all scales to identify flow profiles for
the neurons in the connectome, without pre-imposing a priori categories. The
four flow roles identified are linked to signal propagation motivated by
biological input-response scenarios.
