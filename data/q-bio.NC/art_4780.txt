Discrete Dynamic Causal Modeling and Its Relationship with Directed
  Information
This paper explores the discrete Dynamic Causal Modeling (DDCM) and its
relationship with Directed Information (DI). We prove the conditional
equivalence between DDCM and DI in characterizing the causal relationship
between two brain regions. The theoretical results are demonstrated using fMRI
data obtained under both resting state and stimulus based state. Our numerical
analysis is consistent with that reported in previous study.
