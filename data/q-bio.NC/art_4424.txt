Stochastic Interpretation of Quasi-periodic Event-based Systems
Many networks used in machine learning and as models of biological neural
networks make use of stochastic neurons or neuron-like units. We show that
stochastic artificial neurons can be realized on silicon chips by exploiting
the quasi-periodic behavior of mismatched analog oscillators to approximate the
neuron's stochastic activation function. We represent neurons by finite state
machines (FSMs) that communicate using digital events and whose transitions are
event-triggered. The event generation times of each neuron are controlled by an
analog oscillator internal to that neuron/FSM and the frequencies of the
oscillators in different FSMs are incommensurable. We show that within this
quasi-periodic system, the transition graph of a FSM can be interpreted as the
transition graph of a Markov chain and we show that by using different FSMs, we
can obtain approximations of different stochastic activation functions. We
investigate the quality of the stochastic interpretation of such a
deterministic system and we use the system to realize and sample from a
restricted Boltzmann machine. We implemented the quasi-periodic event-based
system on a custom silicon chip and we show that the chip behavior can be used
to closely approximate a stochastic sampling task.
