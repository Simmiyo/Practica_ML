Optimized motor imagery paradigm based on imagining Chinese characters
  writing movement
Motor imagery (MI) is a mental representation of motor behavior that has been
widely used as a control method for a brain-computer interface (BCI), allowing
communication for the physically impaired. The performance of MI based BCI
mainly depends on the subject's ability to self-modulate EEG signals. Proper
training can help naive subjects learn to modulate brain activity proficiently.
However, training subjects typically involves abstract motor tasks and is
time-consuming. To improve the performance of naive subjects during motor
imagery, a novel paradigm was presented that would guide naive subjects to
modulate brain activity effectively. In this new paradigm, pictures of the left
or right hand were used as cues for subjects to finish the motor imagery task.
Fourteen healthy subjects (11 male, aged 22-25 years, mean 23.6+/-1.16)
participated in this study. The task was to imagine writing a Chinese
character. Specifically, subjects could imagine hand movements following the
sequence of writing strokes in the Chinese character. This paradigm was meant
to find an effective and familiar action for most Chinese people, to provide
them with a specific, extensively practiced task and help them modulate brain
activity. Results showed that the writing task paradigm yielded significantly
better performance than the traditional arrow paradigm (p<0.001). Questionnaire
replies indicated that most subjects thought the new paradigm was easier and
more comfortable. The proposed new motor imagery paradigm could guide subjects
to help them modulate brain activity effectively. Results showed that there
were significant improvements using new paradigm, both in classification
accuracy and usability.
