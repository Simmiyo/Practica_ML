A Comparison of Computational Models for the Extracellular Potential of
  Neurons
The extracellular space has an ambiguous role in neuroscience. It is present
in every physiologically relevant system and often used as a measurement site
in experimental recordings, but it has received subordinate attention compared
to the intracellular domain. In computational modeling, it is often regarded as
a passive, homogeneous resistive medium with a constant conductivity, which
greatly simplifies the computation of extracellular potentials. However, recent
studies have shown that local ionic diffusion and capacitive effects of
electrically active membranes can have a substantial impact on the
extracellular potential. These effects can not be described by traditional
models, and they have been subject to theoretical and experimental analyses. We
strive to give an overview over recent progress in modeling the extracellular
space with special regard towards the concentration and potential dynamics on
different temporal and spatial scales. Three models with distinct assumptions
and levels of detail are compared both theoretically and by means of numerical
simulations: the classical volume conductor (VC) model, which is most
frequently used in form of the line source approximation (LSA); the very
detailed, but computationally intensive Poisson-Nernst-Planck model of
electrodiffusion (PNP); and an intermediate one called the electroneutral model
(EN). The results clearly show that there is no one model for all applications,
as they show significantly different responses especially close to neuronal
membranes. Finally, we list some common use cases for model simulations and
give recommendations on which model to use in each situation.
