Naturally Supervised Learning in Manipulable Technologies
The relationship between physiological systems and modern electromechanical
technologies is fast becoming intimate with high degrees of complex
interaction. It can be argued that muscular function, limb movements, and touch
perception serve supervisory functions for movement control in motion and
touch-based (e.g. manipulable) devices/interfaces and human-machine interfaces
in general. To get at this hypothesis requires the use of novel techniques and
analyses which demonstrate the multifaceted and regulatory role of adaptive
physiological processes in these interactions. Neuromechanics is an approach
that unifies the role of physiological function, motor performance, and
environmental effects in determining human performance. A neuromechanical
perspective will be used to explain the effect of environmental fluctuations on
supervisory mechanisms, which leads to adaptive physiological responses. Three
experiments are presented using two different types of virtual environment that
allowed for selective switching between two sets of environmental forces. This
switching was done in various ways to maximize the variety of results.
Electromyography (EMG) and kinematic information contributed to the development
of human performance-related measures. Both descriptive and specialized
analyses were conducted: peak amplitude analysis, loop trace analysis, and the
analysis of unmatched muscle power. Results presented here provide a window
into performance under a range of conditions. These analyses also demonstrated
myriad consequences for force-related fluctuations on dynamic physiological
regulation. The findings presented here could be applied to the dynamic control
of touch-based and movement-sensitive human-machine systems. In particular, the
design of systems such as human-robotic systems, touch screen devices, and
rehabilitative technologies could benefit from this research.
