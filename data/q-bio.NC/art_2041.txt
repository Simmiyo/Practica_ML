Major and minor. The formula of musical emotions
The new formulas, which determine sign and amplitude of utilitarian emotions,
are proposed on the basis of the information theory of emotions. In area of
perception of musical chords the force of emotions depends on the relative
pitch of sounds of major and minor chords.
  Is advanced hypothesis that in the perception of a musical chord in the
psyche caused by the subject value of some objective function L. This function
is expressed directly through the proportion of the pitch of chord. Major
chords are expressed as the straight proportions, which generate idea about an
increase in the objective function (L>1) and are caused positive utilitarian
emotions. Minor chords are expressed as the inverse proportion, which generate
idea about the decrease of objective function (L<1) and are caused negative
utilitarian emotions.
  The formula of musical emotions is advanced: Pwe = log(L) =
(1/M)*log(n1*n2*n3* ... *nM), where M is a quantity of voices of chord, ni -
integer number (or reciprocal fraction) from the pitch proportion, which
corresponds to the i-th voice of chord.
  Confined experimental check is produced. The limits of the applicability of
the formula of musical emotions are investigated.
