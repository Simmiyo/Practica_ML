Training dynamically balanced excitatory-inhibitory networks
The construction of biologically plausible models of neural circuits is
crucial for understanding the computational properties of the nervous system.
Constructing functional networks composed of separate excitatory and inhibitory
neurons obeying Dale's law presents a number of challenges. We show how a
target-based approach, when combined with a fast online constrained
optimization technique, is capable of building functional models of rate and
spiking recurrent neural networks in which excitation and inhibition are
balanced. Balanced networks can be trained to produce complicated temporal
patterns and to solve input-output tasks while retaining biologically desirable
features such as Dale's law and response variability.
