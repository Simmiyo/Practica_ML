Neural Signal Multiplexing via Compressed Sensing
Transport of neural signals in the brain is challenging, owing to neural
interference and neural noise. There is experimental evidence of multiplexing
of sensory information across population of neurons, particularly in the
vertebrate visual and olfactory systems. Recently, it has been discovered that
in lateral intraparietal cortex of the brain, decision signals are multiplexed
with decision-irrelevant visual signals. Furthermore, it is well known that
several cortical neurons exhibit chaotic spiking patterns. Multiplexing of
chaotic neural signals and their successful demultiplexing in the neurons
amidst interference and noise, is difficult to explain. In this work, a novel
compressed sensing model for efficient multiplexing of chaotic neural signals
constructed using the Hindmarsh-Rose spiking model is proposed. The signals are
multiplexed from a pre-synaptic neuron to its neighbouring post-synaptic
neuron, in the presence of $10^4$ interfering noisy neural signals and
demultiplexed using compressed sensing techniques.
