Measuring multiple spike train synchrony
Measures of multiple spike train synchrony are essential in order to study
issues such as spike timing reliability, network synchronization, and neuronal
coding. These measures can broadly be divided in multivariate measures and
averages over bivariate measures. One of the most recent bivariate approaches,
the ISI-distance, employs the ratio of instantaneous interspike intervals. In
this study we propose two extensions of the ISI-distance, the straightforward
averaged bivariate ISI-distance and the multivariate ISI-diversity based on the
coefficient of variation. Like the original measure these extensions combine
many properties desirable in applications to real data. In particular, they are
parameter free, time scale independent, and easy to visualize in a
time-resolved manner, as we illustrate with in vitro recordings from a cortical
neuron. Using a simulated network of Hindemarsh-Rose neurons as a controlled
configuration we compare the performance of our methods in distinguishing
different levels of multi-neuron spike train synchrony to the performance of
six other previously published measures. We show and explain why the averaged
bivariate measures perform better than the multivariate ones and why the
multivariate ISI-diversity is the best performer among the multivariate
methods. Finally, in a comparison against standard methods that rely on moving
window estimates, we use single-unit monkey data to demonstrate the advantages
of the instantaneous nature of our methods.
