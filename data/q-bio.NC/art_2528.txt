Surrogate-assisted analysis of weighted functional brain networks
Graph-theoretical analyses of complex brain networks is a rapidly evolving
field with a strong impact for neuroscientific and related clinical research.
Due to a number of confounding variables, however, a reliable and meaningful
characterization of particularly functional brain networks is a major
challenge. Addressing this problem, we present an analysis approach for
weighted networks that makes use of surrogate networks with preserved edge
weights or vertex strengths. We first investigate whether characteristics of
weighted networks are influenced by trivial properties of the edge weights or
vertex strengths (e.g., their standard deviations). If so, these influences are
then effectively segregated with an appropriate surrogate normalization of the
respective network characteristic. We demonstrate this approach by
re-examining, in a time-resolved manner, weighted functional brain networks of
epilepsy patients and control subjects derived from simultaneous EEG/MEG
recordings during different behavioral states. We show that this
surrogate-assisted analysis approach reveals complementary information about
these networks, can aid with their interpretation, and thus can prevent
deriving inappropriate conclusions.
