Spontaneous coordinated activity in cultured networks: Analysis of
  multiple ignition sites, primary circuits, burst phase delay distributions
  and functional structures
All higher order central nervous systems exhibit spontaneous neural activity,
though the purpose and mechanistic origin of such activity remains poorly
understood. We explore the ignition and spread of collective spontaneous
electrophysiological burst activity in networks of cultured cortical neurons
growing on microelectrode arrays using information theory and
first-spike-in-burst analysis methods. We show the presence of burst leader
neurons, which form a mono-synaptically connected primary circuit, and initiate
a majority of network bursts. Leader/follower firing delay times form
temporally stable positively skewed distributions. Blocking inhibitory synapses
usually results in shorter delay times with reduced variance. These
distributions are generalized characterizations of internal network dynamics
and provide estimates of pair-wise synaptic distances. We show that mutual
information between neural nodes is a function of distance, which is maintained
under disinhibition. The resulting analysis produces specific quantitative
constraints and insights into the activation patterns of collective neuronal
activity in self-organized cortical networks, which may prove useful for models
emulating spontaneously active systems.
