Automatically tracking neurons in a moving and deforming brain
Advances in optical neuroimaging techniques now allow neural activity to be
recorded with cellular resolution in awake and behaving animals. Brain motion
in these recordings pose a unique challenge. The location of individual neurons
must be tracked in 3D over time to accurately extract single neuron activity
traces. Recordings from small invertebrates like C. elegans are especially
challenging because they undergo very large brain motion and deformation during
animal movement. Here we present an automated computer vision pipeline to
reliably track populations of neurons with single neuron resolution in the
brain of a freely moving C. elegans undergoing large motion and deformation. 3D
volumetric fluorescent images of the animal's brain are straightened, aligned
and registered, and the locations of neurons in the images are found via
segmentation. Each neuron is then assigned an identity using a new
time-independent machine-learning approach we call Neuron Registration Vector
Encoding. In this approach, non-rigid point-set registration is used to match
each segmented neuron in each volume with a set of reference volumes taken from
throughout the recording. The way each neuron matches with the references
defines a feature vector which is clustered to assign an identity to each
neuron in each volume. Finally, thin-plate spline interpolation is used to
correct errors in segmentation and check consistency of assigned identities.
The Neuron Registration Vector Encoding approach proposed here is uniquely well
suited for tracking neurons in brains undergoing large deformations. When
applied to whole-brain calcium imaging recordings in freely moving C. elegans,
this analysis pipeline located 150 neurons for the duration of an 8 minute
recording and consistently found more neurons more quickly than manual or
semi-automated approaches.
