Interplay: Dispersed Activation in Neural Networks
This paper presents a multi-point stimulation of a Hebbian neural network
with investigation of the interplay between the stimulus waves through the
neurons of the network. Equilibrium of the resulting memory is achieved for
recall of specific memory data at a rate faster than single point stimulus. The
interplay of the intersecting stimuli appears to parallel the clarification
process of recall in biological systems.
