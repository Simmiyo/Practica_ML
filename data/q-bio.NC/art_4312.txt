Generating functionals for computational intelligence: the Fisher
  information as an objective function for self-limiting Hebbian learning rules
Generating functionals may guide the evolution of a dynamical system and
constitute a possible route for handling the complexity of neural networks as
relevant for computational intelligence. We propose and explore a new objective
function, which allows to obtain plasticity rules for the afferent synaptic
weights. The adaption rules are Hebbian, self-limiting, and result from the
minimization of the Fisher information with respect to the synaptic flux. We
perform a series of simulations examining the behavior of the new learning
rules in various circumstances. The vector of synaptic weights aligns with the
principal direction of input activities, whenever one is present. A linear
discrimination is performed when there are two or more principal directions;
directions having bimodal firing-rate distributions, being characterized by a
negative excess kurtosis, are preferred. We find robust performance and full
homeostatic adaption of the synaptic weights results as a by-product of the
synaptic flux minimization. This self-limiting behavior allows for stable
online learning for arbitrary durations. The neuron acquires new information
when the statistics of input activities is changed at a certain point of the
simulation, showing however, a distinct resilience to unlearn previously
acquired knowledge. Learning is fast when starting with randomly drawn synaptic
weights and substantially slower when the synaptic weights are already fully
adapted.
