Demonstrating Hybrid Learning in a Flexible Neuromorphic Hardware System
We present results from a new approach to learning and plasticity in
neuromorphic hardware systems: to enable flexibility in implementable learning
mechanisms while keeping high efficiency associated with neuromorphic
implementations, we combine a general-purpose processor with full-custom analog
elements.
  This processor is operating in parallel with a fully parallel neuromorphic
system consisting of an array of synapses connected to analog, continuous time
neuron circuits. Novel analog correlation sensor circuits process spike events
for each synapse in parallel and in real-time.
  The processor uses this pre-processing to compute new weights possibly using
additional information following its program.
  Therefore, learning rules can be defined in software giving a large degree of
flexibility.
  Synapses realize correlation detection geared towards Spike-Timing Dependent
Plasticity (STDP) as central computational primitive in the analog domain.
  Operating at a speed-up factor of 1000 compared to biological time-scale, we
measure time-constants from tens to hundreds of micro-seconds.
  We analyze variability across multiple chips and demonstrate learning using a
multiplicative STDP rule.
  We conclude, that the presented approach will enable flexible and efficient
learning as a platform for neuroscientific research and technological
applications.
