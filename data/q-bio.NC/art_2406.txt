Beyond visual P300 based brain-computer interfacing paradigms
The paper reviews and summarizes recent developments in spatial auditory and
tactile brain-computer interfacing neurotechology applications. It serves as
the latest developments summary in "non-visual" brain-computer interfacing
solutions presented in a tutorial delivered by the author at the IICST 2013
workshop. The novel concepts of unimodal auditory or tactile, as well as a
bimodal combined paradigms are described and supported with recent research
results from our BCI-lab research group at Life Science Center, University of
Tsukuba, Japan. The newly developed experimental paradigms fit perfectly to
needs of paralyzed or hearing impaired users, in case of tactile stimulus, as
well as for able users who cannot utilize vision in computer or machine
interaction (driving or operation of machinery required not disturbed
eyesight). We present and review the EEG event related potential responses
useful for brain computer interfacing applications beyond state-of-the-art
visual paradigms. In conclusion the recent results are discussed and
suggestions for further applications are drawn.
