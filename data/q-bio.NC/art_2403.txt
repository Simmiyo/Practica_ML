Relativistic conformal symmetry of neural field propagation in the brain
In this paper, we address a neural field equation that characterizes
spatio-temporal propagation of a neural population pulse. Due that the human
brain is a complex system whose constituents interaction give rise to
fundamental states of consciousness and behavior, it is crucial to gain insight
into its functioning even at relativistic scales. To this end, we study the
action of the relativistic conformal group on the accounted neural field
propagation equation. In particular, we obtain an exact solution for the field
propagation equation when the space-time is 3 or 4 dimensional. Furthermore, in
the 4 dimensional case and the large distance limit, it is shown that the
neural population pulse becomes a Yukawa potential.
