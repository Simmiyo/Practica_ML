More than discrete or continuous: a bird's view
I try to give mathematical evidence to the following equivalence, which is
based on ideas from Plato (Timaeus): reality emerges from a more primitive,
non-geometrical, reality in the same way as the brain construct (understands,
simulates, transforms, encodes or decodes) the image of reality, starting from
intensive properties (like a bunch of spiking signals sent by receptors in the
retina), without any use of extensive (i.e. spatial or geometric) properties.
