Agent-based Exploration of Wirings of Biological Neural Networks:
  Position Paper
The understanding of human central nervous system depends on knowledge of its
wiring. However, there are still gaps in our understanding of its wiring due to
technical difficulties. While some information is coming out from human
experiments, medical research is lacking of simulation models to put current
findings together to obtain the global picture and to predict hypotheses to
lead future experiments. Agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) is a strong
candidate for the simulation model. In this position paper, we discuss the
current status of "neural wiring" and "ABMS in biological systems". In
particular, we discuss that the ABMS context provides features required for
exploration of biological neural wiring.
