A noise-driven attractor switching device
Problems with artificial neural networks originate from their deterministic
nature and inevitable prior learnings, resulting in inadequate adaptability
against unpredictable, abrupt environmental change. Here we show that a
stochastically excitable threshold unit can be utilized by these systems to
partially overcome the environmental change. Using an excitable threshold
system, attractors were created that represent quasi-equilibrium states into
which a system settles until disrupted by environmental change. Furthermore,
noise-driven attractor stabilization and switching were embodied by inhibitory
connections. Noise works as a power source to stabilize and switch attractors,
and endows the system with hysteresis behavior that resembles that of
stereopsis and binocular rivalry in the human visual cortex. A canonical model
of the ring network with inhibitory connections composed of class 1 neurons
also shows properties that are similar to the simple threshold system.
