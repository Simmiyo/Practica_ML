Adaptive frequency-based modeling of whole-brain oscillations:
  Predicting regional vulnerability and hazardousness rates
Whole-brain computational modeling based on structural connectivity has shown
great promise in successfully simulating fMRI BOLD signals with temporal
co-activation patterns that are highly similar to empirical functional
connectivity patterns during resting state. Importantly, previous studies have
shown that spontaneous fluctuations in co-activation patterns of distributed
brain regions have an inherent dynamic nature with regard to the frequency
spectrum of intrinsic brain oscillations. In this modeling study, we introduced
frequency dynamics into a system of coupled oscillators, where each oscillator
represents the local mean-field model of a brain region. We first showed that
the collective behavior of interacting oscillators reproduces previously shown
features of brain dynamics. Second, we examined the effect of simulated lesions
in gray matter by applying an in silico perturbation protocol to the brain
model. We present a new approach to map the effects of vulnerability in brain
networks and introduce a measure of regional hazardousness based on mapping of
the degree of divergence in a feature space
