Deterministic excitable media under Poisson drive: power law responses,
  spiral waves and dynamic range
When each site of a spatially extended excitable medium is independently
driven by a Poisson stimulus with rate h, the interplay between creation and
annihilation of excitable waves leads to an average activity F. It has recently
been suggested that in the low-stimulus regime (h ~ 0) the response function
F(h) of hypercubic deterministic systems behaves as a power law, F ~ h^m.
Moreover the response exponent m has been predicted to depend only on the
dimensionality d of the lattice, m = 1/(1+d) [T. Ohta and T. Yoshimura, Physica
D 205, 189 (2005)]. In order to test this prediction, we study the response
function of excitable lattices modeled by either coupled Morris-Lecar equations
or Greenberg-Hastings cellular automata. We show that the prediction is
verified in our model systems for d = 1, 2, and 3, provided that a minimum set
of conditions is satisfied. Under these conditions, the dynamic range - which
measures the range of stimulus intensities that can be coded by the network
activity - increases with the dimensionality d of the network. The power law
scenario breaks down, however, if the system can exhibit self-sustained
activity (spiral waves). In this case, we recover a scenario that is common to
probabilistic excitable media: as a function of the conductance coupling G
among the excitable elements, the dynamic range is maximized precisely at the
critical value G_c above which self-sustained activity becomes stable. We
discuss the implications of these results in the context of neural coding.
