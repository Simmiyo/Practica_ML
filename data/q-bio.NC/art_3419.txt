Leabra7: a Python package for modeling recurrent, biologically-realistic
  neural networks
Emergent is a software package that uses the AdEx neural dynamics model and
LEABRA learning algorithm to simulate and train arbitrary recurrent neural
network architectures in a biologically-realistic manner. We present Leabra7, a
complementary Python library that implements these same algorithms. Leabra7 is
developed and distributed using modern software development principles, and
integrates tightly with Python's scientific stack. We demonstrate recurrent
Leabra7 networks using traditional pattern-association tasks and a standard
machine learning task, classifying the IRIS dataset.
