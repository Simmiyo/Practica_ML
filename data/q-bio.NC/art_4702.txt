A quantum dynamic belief decision making model
The sure thing principle and the law of total probability are basic laws in
classic probability theory. A disjunction fallacy leads to the violation of
these two classical probability laws. In this paper, a new quantum dynamic
belief decision making model based on quantum dynamic modelling and
Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory is proposed to address this issue and
model the real human decision-making process. Some mathematical techniques are
borrowed from quantum mathematics. Generally, belief and action are two parts
in a decision making process. The uncertainty in belief part is represented by
a superposition of certain states. The uncertainty in actions is represented as
an extra uncertainty state. The interference effect is produced due to the
entanglement between beliefs and actions. Basic probability assignment (BPA) of
decisions is generated by quantum dynamic modelling. Then BPA of the extra
uncertain state and an entanglement degree defined by an entropy function named
Deng entropy are used to measure the interference effect. Compared the existing
model, the number of free parameters is less in our model. Finally, a classical
categorization decision-making experiment is illustrated to show the
effectiveness of our model.
