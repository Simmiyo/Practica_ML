Physical Light as a Metaphor for Inner Light
The metaphor between physical light and inner light has a long history that
permeates diverse languages and cultures. This paper outlines a system for
using basic principles from optics to visually represent psychological states
and processes such as ideation, enlightenment, mindfulness, and fragmentation
versus integrity, as well as situations that occur between people involving
phenomena such as honest versus deceptive communication, and understanding
versus misunderstanding. The paper summarizes two ongoing projects based on
this system: The Light and Enlightenment art installation project, and the
Soultracker virtual reality project. These projects enable people to depict
their inner lives and external worlds including situations and relationships
with others, both as they are and as they could be, and explore alternative
paths for navigating challenges and living to their fullest potential. The
projects aim to be of clinical value as therapeutic tools, as well as of
pedagogical value by providing a concrete language for depicting aspects of
human nature that can otherwise seem elusive and intangible.
