Achieving Control of Lesion Growth in CNS with Minimal Damage
Lesions in central nervous system (CNS) and their growth leads to
debilitating diseases like Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's etc. We
developed a model earlier which shows how the lesion growth can be arrested
through a beneficial auto-immune mechanism. The success of the approach depends
on a set of control parameters and their phase space was shown to have a smooth
manifold separating the uncontrolled lesion growth region from the controlled.
Here we show that an optimal set of parameter values exist which minimizes
system damage while achieving control of lesion growth.
