Brain architecture: A design for natural computation
Fifty years ago, John von Neumann compared the architecture of the brain with
that of computers that he invented and which is still in use today. In those
days, the organisation of computers was based on concepts of brain
organisation. Here, we give an update on current results on the global
organisation of neural systems. For neural systems, we outline how the spatial
and topological architecture of neuronal and cortical networks facilitates
robustness against failures, fast processing, and balanced network activation.
Finally, we discuss mechanisms of self-organization for such architectures.
After all, the organization of the brain might again inspire computer
architecture.
