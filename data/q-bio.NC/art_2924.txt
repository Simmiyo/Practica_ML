Riemannian geometry applied to detection of respiratory states from EEG
  signals: the basis for a brain-ventilator interface
During mechanical ventilation, patient-ventilator disharmony is frequently
observed and may result in increased breathing effort, compromising the
patient's comfort and recovery. This circumstance requires clinical
intervention and becomes challenging when verbal communication is difficult. In
this work, we propose a brain computer interface (BCI) to automatically and
non-invasively detect patient-ventilator disharmony from
electroencephalographic (EEG) signals: a brain-ventilator interface (BVI). Our
framework exploits the cortical activation provoked by the inspiratory
compensation when the subject and the ventilator are desynchronized. Use of a
one-class approach and Riemannian geometry of EEG covariance matrices allows
effective classification of respiratory states. The BVI is validated on nine
healthy subjects that performed different respiratory tasks that mimic a
patient-ventilator disharmony. Classification performances, in terms of areas
under ROC curves, are significantly improved using EEG signals compared to
detection based on air flow. Reduction in the number of electrodes that can
achieve discrimination can often be desirable (e.g. for portable BCI systems).
By using an iterative channel selection technique, the Common Highest Order
Ranking (CHOrRa), we find that a reduced set of electrodes (n=6) can slightly
improve for an intra-subject configuration, and it still provides fairly good
performances for a general inter-subject setting. Results support the
discriminant capacity of our approach to identify anomalous respiratory states,
by learning from a training set containing only normal respiratory epochs. The
proposed framework opens the door to brain-ventilator interfaces for monitoring
patient's breathing comfort and adapting ventilator parameters to patient
respiratory needs.
