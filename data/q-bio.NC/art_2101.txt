Artificial Brain Based on Credible Neural Circuits in a Human Brain
Neurons are individually translated into simple gates to plan a brain based
on human psychology and intelligence. State machines, assumed previously
learned in subconscious associative memory are shown to enable equation solving
and rudimentary thinking using nanoprocessing within short term memory.
