Novel Virtual Moving Sound-based Spatial Auditory Brain-Computer
  Interface Paradigm
This paper reports on a study in which a novel virtual moving sound-based
spatial auditory brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm is developed. Classic
auditory BCIs rely on spatially static stimuli, which are often boring and
difficult to perceive when subjects have non-uniform spatial hearing perception
characteristics. The concept of moving sound proposed and tested in the paper
allows for the creation of a P300 oddball paradigm of necessary target and
non-target auditory stimuli, which are more interesting and easier to
distinguish. We present a report of our study of seven healthy subjects, which
proves the concept of moving sound stimuli usability for a novel BCI. We
compare online BCI classification results in static and moving sound paradigms
yielding similar accuracy results. The subject preference reports suggest that
the proposed moving sound protocol is more comfortable and easier to
discriminate with the online BCI.
