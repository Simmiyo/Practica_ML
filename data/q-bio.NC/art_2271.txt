Visualization in Connectomics
Connectomics is a field of neuroscience that analyzes neuronal connections. A
connectome is a complete map of a neuronal system, comprising all neuronal
connections between its structures. The term "connectome" is close to the word
"genome" and implies completeness of all neuronal connections, in the same way
as a genome is a complete listing of all nucleotide sequences. The goal of
connectomics is to create a complete representation of the brain's wiring. Such
a representation is believed to increase our understanding of how functional
brain states emerge from their underlying anatomical structure. Furthermore, it
can provide important information for the cure of neuronal dysfunctions like
schizophrenia or autism. In this paper, we review the current state-of-the-art
of visualization and image processing techniques in the field of connectomics
and describe some remaining challenges.
