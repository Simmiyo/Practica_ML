Statistical Mechanics Characterization of Neuronal Mosaics
The spatial distribution of neuronal cells is an important requirement for
achieving proper neuronal function in several parts of the nervous system of
most animals. For instance, specific distribution of photoreceptors and related
neuronal cells, particularly the ganglion cells, in mammal's retina is required
in order to properly sample the projected scene. This work presents how two
concepts from the areas of statistical mechanics and complex systems, namely
the \emph{lacunarity} and the \emph{multiscale entropy} (i.e. the entropy
calculated over progressively diffused representations of the cell mosaic),
have allowed effective characterization of the spatial distribution of retinal
cells.
