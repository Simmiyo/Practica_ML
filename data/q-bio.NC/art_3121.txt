A Neural Networks Approach to Predicting How Things Might Have Turned
  Out Had I Mustered the Nerve to Ask Barry Cottonfield to the Junior Prom Back
  in 1997
We use a feed-forward artificial neural network with back-propagation through
a single hidden layer to predict Barry Cottonfield's likely reply to this
author's invitation to the "Once Upon a Daydream" junior prom at the Conard
High School gymnasium back in 1997. To examine the network's ability to
generalize to such a situation beyond specific training scenarios, we use a L2
regularization term in the cost function and examine performance over a range
of regularization strengths. In addition, we examine the nonsensical
decision-making strategies that emerge in Barry at times when he has recently
engaged in a fight with his annoying kid sister Janice. To simulate Barry's
inability to learn efficiently from large mistakes (an observation well
documented by his algebra teacher during sophomore year), we choose a simple
quadratic form for the cost function, so that the weight update magnitude is
not necessary correlated with the magnitude of output error.
  Network performance on test data indicates that this author would have
received an 87.2 (1)% chance of "Yes" given a particular set of environmental
input parameters. Most critically, the optimal method of question delivery is
found to be Secret Note rather than Verbal Speech. There also exists mild
evidence that wearing a burgundy mini-dress might have helped. The network
performs comparably for all values of regularization strength, which suggests
that the nature of noise in a high school hallway during passing time does not
affect much of anything. We comment on possible biases inherent in the output,
implications regarding the functionality of a real biological network, and
future directions. Over-training is also discussed, although the linear algebra
teacher assures us that in Barry's case this is not possible.
