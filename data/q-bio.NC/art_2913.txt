Study of the characteristic parameters of the normal voices of
  Argentinian speakers
The voice laboratory permits to study the human voices using a method that is
objective and noninvasive. In this work, we have studied the parameters of the
human voice such as pitch, formant, jitter, shimmer and harmonic-noise ratio of
a group of young people. This statistical information of parameters is obtained
from Argentinian speakers.
