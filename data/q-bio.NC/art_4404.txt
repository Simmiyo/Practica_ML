Proton Conducting Graphene Oxide Coupled Neuron Transistors for
  Brain-Inspired Cognitive Systems
Neuron is the most important building block in our brain, and information
processing in individual neuron involves the transformation of input synaptic
spike trains into an appropriate output spike train. Hardware implementation of
neuron by individual ionic/electronic hybrid device is of great significance
for enhancing our understanding of the brain and solving sensory processing and
complex recognition tasks. Here, we provide a proof-of-principle artificial
neuron based on a proton conducting graphene oxide (GO) coupled oxide-based
electric-double-layer (EDL) transistor with multiple driving inputs and one
modulatory input terminal. Paired-pulse facilitation, dendritic integration and
orientation tuning were successfully emulated. Additionally, neuronal gain
control (arithmetic) in the scheme of rate coding is also experimentally
demonstrated. Our results provide a new-concept approach for building
brain-inspired cognitive systems.
