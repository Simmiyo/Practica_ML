Discrete, 3D distributed, linear imaging methods of electric neuronal
  activity. Part 1: exact, zero error localization
This paper deals with the EEG/MEG neuroimaging problem: given measurements of
scalp electric potential differences (EEG: electroencephalogram) and
extracranial magnetic fields (MEG: magnetoencephalogram), find the 3D
distribution of the generating electric neuronal activity. This problem has no
unique solution. Only particular solutions with "good" localization properties
are of interest, since neuroimaging is concerned with the localization of brain
function. In this paper, a general family of linear imaging methods with exact,
zero error localization to point-test sources is presented. One particular
member of this family is sLORETA (standardized low resolution brain
electromagnetic tomography; Pascual-Marqui, Methods Find. Exp. Clin. Pharmacol.
2002, 24D:5-12;
http://www.unizh.ch/keyinst/NewLORETA/sLORETA/sLORETA-Math01.pdf). It is shown
here that sLORETA has no localization bias in the presence of measurement and
biological noise. Another member of this family, denoted as eLORETA (exact low
resolution brain electromagnetic tomography; Pascual-Marqui 2005:
http://www.research-projects.unizh.ch/p6990.htm), is a genuine inverse solution
(not merely a linear imaging method) with exact, zero error localization in the
presence of measurement and structured biological noise. The general family of
imaging methods is further extended to include data-dependent (adaptive)
quasi-linear imaging methods, also with the exact, zero error localization
property.
