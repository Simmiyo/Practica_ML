Inferring coupling strength from event-related dynamics
We propose an approach for inferring strength of coupling between two systems
from their transient dynamics. This is of vital importance in cases where most
information is carried by the transients, for instance in evoked potentials
measured commonly in electrophysiology. We show viability of our approach using
nonlinear and linear measures of synchronization on a population model of
thalamocortical loop and on a system of two coupled Roessler-type oscillators
in non-chaotic regime.
