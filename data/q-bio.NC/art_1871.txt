When Response Variability Increases Neural Network Robustness to
  Synaptic Noise
Cortical sensory neurons are known to be highly variable, in the sense that
responses evoked by identical stimuli often change dramatically from trial to
trial. The origin of this variability is uncertain, but it is usually
interpreted as detrimental noise that reduces the computational accuracy of
neural circuits. Here we investigate the possibility that such response
variability might, in fact, be beneficial, because it may partially compensate
for a decrease in accuracy due to stochastic changes in the synaptic strengths
of a network. We study the interplay between two kinds of noise, response (or
neuronal) noise and synaptic noise, by analyzing their joint influence on the
accuracy of neural networks trained to perform various tasks. We find an
interesting, generic interaction: when fluctuations in the synaptic connections
are proportional to their strengths (multiplicative noise), a certain amount of
response noise in the input neurons can significantly improve network
performance, compared to the same network without response noise. Performance
is enhanced because response noise and multiplicative synaptic noise are in
some ways equivalent. These results are demonstrated analytically for the most
basic network consisting of two input neurons and one output neuron performing
a simple classification task, but computer simulations show that the phenomenon
persists in a wide range of architectures, including recurrent (attractor)
networks and sensory-motor networks that perform coordinate transformations.
The results suggest that response variability could play an important dynamic
role in networks that continuously learn.
