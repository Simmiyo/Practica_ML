Impact of network structure and cellular response on spike time
  correlations
Novel experimental techniques reveal the simultaneous activity of larger and
larger numbers of neurons. As a result there is increasing interest in the
structure of cooperative -- or correlated -- activity in neural populations,
and in the possible impact of such correlations on the neural code. A
fundamental theoretical challenge is to understand how the architecture of
network connectivity along with the dynamical properties of single cells shape
the magnitude and timescale of correlations. We provide a general approach to
this problem by extending prior techniques based on linear response theory. We
consider networks of general integrate-and-fire cells with arbitrary
architecture, and provide explicit expressions for the approximate
cross-correlation between constituent cells. These correlations depend strongly
on the operating point (input mean and variance) of the neurons, even when
connectivity is fixed. Moreover, the approximations admit an expansion in
powers of the matrices that describe the network architecture. This expansion
can be readily interpreted in terms of paths between different cells. We apply
our results to large excitatory-inhibitory networks, and demonstrate first how
precise balance --- or lack thereof --- between the strengths and timescales of
excitatory and inhibitory synapses is reflected in the overall correlation
structure of the network. We then derive explicit expressions for the average
correlation structure in randomly connected networks. These expressions help to
identify the important factors that shape coordinated neural activity in such
networks.
