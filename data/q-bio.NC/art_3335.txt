An Integrative Introduction to Human Augmentation Science
Human Augmentation (HA) spans several technical fields and methodological
approaches, including Experimental Psychology, Human-Computer Interaction,
Psychophysiology, and Artificial Intelligence. Augmentation involves various
strategies for optimizing and controlling cognitive states, which requires an
understanding of biological plasticity, dynamic cognitive processes, and models
of adaptive systems. As an instructive lesson, we will explore a few HA-related
concepts and outstanding issues. Next, we focus on inducing and controlling HA
using experimental methods by introducing three techniques for HA
implementation: learning augmentation, augmentation using physical media, and
extended phenotype modeling. To conclude, we will review integrative approaches
to augmentation, which transcend specific functions.
