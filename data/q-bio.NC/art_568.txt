On the spike train variability characterized by variance-to-mean power
  relationship
We propose a statistical method for modeling the non-Poisson variability of
spike trains observed in a wide range of brain regions. Central to our approach
is the assumption that the variance and the mean of interspike intervals are
related by a power function characterized by two parameters: the scale factor
and exponent. It is shown that this single assumption allows the variability of
spike trains to have an arbitrary scale and various dependencies on the firing
rate in the spike count statistics, as well as in the interval statistics,
depending on the two parameters of the power function. We also propose a
statistical model for spike trains that exhibits the variance-to-mean power
relationship, and based on this a maximum likelihood method is developed for
inferring the parameters from rate-modulated spike trains. The proposed method
is illustrated on simulated and experimental spike trains.
