Noise-assisted spike propagation in myelinated neurons
We consider noise-assisted spike propagation in myelinated axons within a
multi-compartment stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley model. The noise originates from a
finite number of ion channels in each node of Ranvier. For the subthreshold
internodal electric coupling, we show that (i) intrinsic noise removes the
sharply defined threshold for spike propagation from node to node, and (ii)
there exists an optimum number of ion channels which allows for the most
efficient signal propagation and it corresponds to the actual physiological
values.
