Guiding Network Analysis using Graph Slepians: An Illustration for the
  C. Elegans Connectome
Spectral approaches of network analysis heavily rely upon the
eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian. For instance, in graph signal
processing, the Laplacian eigendecomposition is used to define the graph
Fourier transform and then transpose signal processing operations to graphs by
implementing them in the spectral domain. Here, we build on recent work that
generalized Slepian functions to the graph setting. In particular, graph
Slepians are band-limited graph signals with maximal energy concentration in a
given subgraph. We show how this approach can be used to guide network
analysis; i.e., we propose a visualization that reveals network organization of
a subgraph, but while striking a balance with global network structure. These
developments are illustrated for the structural connectome of the C. Elegans.
