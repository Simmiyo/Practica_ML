On the Theoretical Possibility of Quantum Visual Information Transfer to
  the Human Brain
The feasibility of wave function collapse in the human brain has been the
subject of vigorous scientific debates since the advent of quantum theory.
Scientists like Von Neumann, London, Bauer and Wigner (initially) believed that
wave function collapse occurs in the brain or is caused by the mind of the
observer. It is a legitimate question to ask how human brain can receive subtle
external visual quantum information intact when it must pass through very noisy
and complex pathways from the eye to the brain? There are several approaches to
investigate information processing in the brain, each of which presents a
different set of conclusions. Penrose and Hameroff have hypothesized that there
is quantum information processing inside the human brain whose material
substrate involves microtubules and consciousness is the result of a collective
wavefunction collapse occurring in these structures. Conversely, Tegmark stated
that owing to thermal decoherence there cannot be any quantum processing in
neurons of the brain and processing in the brain must be classical for
cognitive processes. However, Rosa and Faber presented an argument for a middle
way which shows that none of the previous authors are completely right and
despite the presence of decoherence, it is still possible to consider the brain
to be a quantum system. Additionally, Thaheld, has concluded that quantum
states of photons do collapse in the human eye and there is no possibility for
collapse of visual quantum states in the brain and thus there is no possibility
for the quantum state reduction in the brain. In this paper we conclude that if
we accept the main essence of the above approaches taken together, each of them
can provide a different part of a teleportation mechanism.
