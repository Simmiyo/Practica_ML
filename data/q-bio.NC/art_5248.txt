Simulating Spiking Neural P systems without delays using GPUs
We present in this paper our work regarding simulating a type of P system
known as a spiking neural P system (SNP system) using graphics processing units
(GPUs). GPUs, because of their architectural optimization for parallel
computations, are well-suited for highly parallelizable problems. Due to the
advent of general purpose GPU computing in recent years, GPUs are not limited
to graphics and video processing alone, but include computationally intensive
scientific and mathematical applications as well. Moreover P systems, including
SNP systems, are inherently and maximally parallel computing models whose
inspirations are taken from the functioning and dynamics of a living cell. In
particular, SNP systems try to give a modest but formal representation of a
special type of cell known as the neuron and their interactions with one
another. The nature of SNP systems allowed their representation as matrices,
which is a crucial step in simulating them on highly parallel devices such as
GPUs. The highly parallel nature of SNP systems necessitate the use of hardware
intended for parallel computations. The simulation algorithms, design
considerations, and implementation are presented. Finally, simulation results,
observations, and analyses using an SNP system that generates all numbers in
$\mathbb N$ - {1} are discussed, as well as recommendations for future work.
