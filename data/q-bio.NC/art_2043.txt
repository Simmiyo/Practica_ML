Coherent states, fractals and brain waves
I show that a functional representation of self-similarity (as the one
occurring in fractals) is provided by squeezed coherent states. In this way,
the dissipative model of brain is shown to account for the self-similarity in
brain background activity suggested by power-law distributions of power
spectral densities of electrocorticograms. I also briefly discuss the
action-perception cycle in the dissipative model with reference to
intentionality in terms of trajectories in the memory state space.
