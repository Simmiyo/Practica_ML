The Cyborg Astrobiologist: First Field Experience
We present results from the first geological field tests of the `Cyborg
Astrobiologist', which is a wearable computer and video camcorder system that
we are using to test and train a computer-vision system towards having some of
the autonomous decision-making capabilities of a field-geologist and
field-astrobiologist. The Cyborg Astrobiologist platform has thus far been used
for testing and development of these algorithms and systems: robotic
acquisition of quasi-mosaics of images, real-time image segmentation, and
real-time determination of interesting points in the image mosaics. The
hardware and software systems function reliably, and the computer-vision
algorithms are adequate for the first field tests. In addition to the
proof-of-concept aspect of these field tests, the main result of these field
tests is the enumeration of those issues that we can improve in the future,
including: first, detection and accounting for shadows caused by 3D jagged
edges in the outcrop; second, reincorporation of more sophisticated
texture-analysis algorithms into the system; third, creation of hardware and
software capabilities to control the camera's zoom lens in an intelligent
manner; and fourth, development of algorithms for interpretation of complex
geological scenery. Nonetheless, despite these technical inadequacies, this
Cyborg Astrobiologist system, consisting of a camera-equipped wearable-computer
and its computer-vision algorithms, has demonstrated its ability of finding
genuinely interesting points in real-time in the geological scenery, and then
gathering more information about these interest points in an automated manner.
