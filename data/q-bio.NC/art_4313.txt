On the Hamiltonian structure of large deviations in stochastic hybrid
  systems
We develop the connection between large deviation theory and more applied
approaches to stochastic hybrid systems by highlighting a common underlying
Hamiltonian structure. A stochastic hybrid system involves the coupling between
a piecewise deterministic dynamical system in $R^d$ and a time-homogeneous
Markov chain on some discrete space $\Gamma$. We assume that the Markov chain
on $\Gamma$ is ergodic, and that the discrete dynamics is much faster than the
piecewise deterministic dynamics (separation of time-scales). Using the
Perron-Frobenius theorem and the calculus-of-variations, we evaluate the rate
function of a large deviation principle in terms of a classical action, whose
Hamiltonian is given by the Perron eigenvalue of a $|\Gamma|$-dimensional
linear equation. The corresponding linear operator depends on the transition
rates of the Markov chain and the nonlinear functions of the piecewise
deterministic system. The resulting Hamiltonian is identical to one derived
using path-integrals and WKB methods. We illustrate the theory by considering
the example of stochastic ion channels.
