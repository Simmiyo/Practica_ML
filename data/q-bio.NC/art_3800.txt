Probabilistic pathway representation of cognitive information
We present for mental processes the program of mathematical mapping which has
been successfully realized for physical processes. We emphasize that our
project is not about mathematical simulation of brain's functioning as a
complex physical system, i.e., mapping of physical and chemical processes in
the brain on mathematical spaces. The project is about mapping of purely mental
processes on mathematical spaces. We present various arguments -- philosophic,
mathematical, information, and neurophysiological -- in favor of the $p$-adic
model of mental space. $p$-adic spaces have structures of hierarchic trees and
in our model such a tree hierarchy is considered as an image of neuronal
hierarchy. Hierarchic neural pathways are considered as fundamental units of
information processing. As neural pathways can go through whole body, the
mental space is produced by the whole neural system. Finally, we develop
Probabilistic Neural Pathway Model in that Mental States are represented by
probability distributions on mental space.
