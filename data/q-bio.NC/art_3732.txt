Quantitative Neural Network Model of the Tip-of-the-Tongue Phenomenon
  Based on Synthesized Memory-Psycholinguistic-Metacognitive Approach
A new three-stage computer artificial neural network model of the
tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon is proposed. Each word's node is build from some
interconnected learned auto-associative two-layer neural networks each of which
represents separate word's semantic, lexical, or phonological components. The
model synthesizes memory, psycholinguistic, and metamemory approaches, bridges
speech errors and naming chronometry research traditions, and can explain
quantitatively many tip-of-the-tongue effects.
