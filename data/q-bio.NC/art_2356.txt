Large-Scale Automatic Reconstruction of Neuronal Processes from Electron
  Microscopy Images
Automated sample preparation and electron microscopy enables acquisition of
very large image data sets. These technical advances are of special importance
to the field of neuroanatomy, as 3D reconstructions of neuronal processes at
the nm scale can provide new insight into the fine grained structure of the
brain. Segmentation of large-scale electron microscopy data is the main
bottleneck in the analysis of these data sets. In this paper we present a
pipeline that provides state-of-the art reconstruction performance while
scaling to data sets in the GB-TB range. First, we train a random forest
classifier on interactive sparse user annotations. The classifier output is
combined with an anisotropic smoothing prior in a Conditional Random Field
framework to generate multiple segmentation hypotheses per image. These
segmentations are then combined into geometrically consistent 3D objects by
segmentation fusion. We provide qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the
automatic segmentation and demonstrate large-scale 3D reconstructions of
neuronal processes from a $\mathbf{27,000}$ $\mathbf{\mu m^3}$ volume of brain
tissue over a cube of $\mathbf{30 \; \mu m}$ in each dimension corresponding to
1000 consecutive image sections. We also introduce Mojo, a proofreading tool
including semi-automated correction of merge errors based on sparse user
scribbles.
