The braingraph.org Database of High Resolution Structural Connectomes
  and the Brain Graph Tools
Based on the data of the NIH-funded Human Connectome Project, we have
computed structural connectomes of 426 human subjects in five different
resolutions of 83, 129, 234, 463 and 1015 nodes and several edge weights. The
graphs are given in anatomically annotated GraphML format that facilitates
better further processing and visualization. For 96 subjects, the anatomically
classified sub-graphs can also be accessed, formed from the vertices
corresponding to distinct lobes or even smaller regions of interests of the
brain. For example, one can easily download and study the connectomes,
restricted to the frontal lobes or just to the left precuneus of 96 subjects
using the data. Partially directed connectomes of 423 subjects are also
available for download. We also present a GitHub-deposited set of tools, called
the Brain Graph Tools, for several processing tasks of the connectomes on the
site \url{http://braingraph.org}.
