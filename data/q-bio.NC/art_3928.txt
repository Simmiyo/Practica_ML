The Electron Capture Hypothesis - A Challenge to Neuroscientists
Lower speed impinging ions (with hydration shells) cannot transverse ion
channels once internal charge goes positive. Yet neural pulse waveforms fail to
show the expected risetime distortion beginning at zero voltage. Observed
waveforms cannot be explained unless electron capture is considered.
