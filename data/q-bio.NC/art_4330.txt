Hypotheses of neural code and the information model of the
  neuron-detector
This paper deals with the problem of neural code solving. On the basis of the
formulated hypotheses the information model of a neuron-detector is suggested,
the detector being one of the basic elements of an artificial neural network
(ANN). The paper subjects the connectionist paradigm of ANN building to
criticism and suggests a new presentation paradigm for ANN building and
neuroelements (NE) learning. The adequacy of the suggested model is proved by
the fact that is does not contradict the modern propositions of neuropsychology
and neurophysiology.
