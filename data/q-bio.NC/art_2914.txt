Validation of neural spike sorting algorithms without ground-truth
  information
We describe a suite of validation metrics that assess the credibility of a
given automatic spike sorting algorithm applied to a given electrophysiological
recording, when ground-truth is unavailable. By rerunning the spike sorter two
or more times, the metrics measure stability under various perturbations
consistent with variations in the data itself, making no assumptions about the
noise model, nor about the internal workings of the sorting algorithm. Such
stability is a prerequisite for reproducibility of results. We illustrate the
metrics on standard sorting algorithms for both in vivo and ex vivo recordings.
We believe that such metrics could reduce the significant human labor currently
spent on validation, and should form an essential part of large-scale automated
spike sorting and systematic benchmarking of algorithms.
