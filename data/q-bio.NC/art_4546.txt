Dynamical Entropy Production in Spiking Neuron Networks in the Balanced
  State
We demonstrate deterministic extensive chaos in the dynamics of large sparse
networks of theta neurons in the balanced state. The analysis is based on
numerically exact calculations of the full spectrum of Lyapunov exponents, the
entropy production rate and the attractor dimension. Extensive chaos is found
in inhibitory networks and becomes more intense when an excitatory population
is included. We find a strikingly high rate of entropy production that would
limit information representation in cortical spike patterns to the immediate
stimulus response.
