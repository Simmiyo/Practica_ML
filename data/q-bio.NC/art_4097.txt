A Model of Decision-Making in Groups of Humans
Decisions by humans depend on their estimations given some uncertain sensory
data. These decisions can also be influenced by the behavior of others. Here we
present a mathematical model to quantify this influence, inviting a further
study on the cognitive consequences of social information. We also expect that
the present model can be used for a better understanding of the neural circuits
implicated in social processing.
