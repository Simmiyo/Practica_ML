Energy Distribution of EEG Signals: EEG Signal Wavelet-Neural Network
  Classifier
In this paper, a wavelet-based neural network (WNN) classifier for
recognizing EEG signals is implemented and tested under three sets EEG signals
(healthy subjects, patients with epilepsy and patients with epileptic syndrome
during the seizure). First, the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with the
Multi-Resolution Analysis (MRA) is applied to decompose EEG signal at
resolution levels of the components of the EEG signal (delta, theta, alpha,
beta and gamma) and the Parsevals theorem are employed to extract the
percentage distribution of energy features of the EEG signal at different
resolution levels. Second, the neural network (NN) classifies these extracted
features to identify the EEGs type according to the percentage distribution of
energy features. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been evaluated
using in total 300 EEG signals. The results showed that the proposed classifier
has the ability of recognizing and classifying EEG signals efficiently.
