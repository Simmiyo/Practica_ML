Cognitive computation with autonomously active neural networks: an
  emerging field
The human brain is autonomously active. To understand the functional role of
this self-sustained neural activity, and its interplay with the sensory data
input stream, is an important question in cognitive system research and we
review here the present state of theoretical modelling.
  This review will start with a brief overview of the experimental efforts,
together with a discussion of transient vs. self-sustained neural activity in
the framework of reservoir computing. The main emphasis will be then on two
paradigmal neural network architectures showing continuously ongoing
transient-state dynamics: saddle point networks and networks of attractor
relics.
  Self-active neural networks are confronted with two seemingly contrasting
demands: a stable internal dynamical state and sensitivity to incoming stimuli.
We show, that this dilemma can be solved by networks of attractor relics based
on competitive neural dynamics, where the attractor relics compete on one side
with each other for transient dominance, and on the other side with the
dynamical influence of the input signals. Unsupervised and local Hebbian-style
online learning then allows the system to build up correlations between the
internal dynamical transient states and the sensory input stream. An emergent
cognitive capability results from this set-up. The system performs online, and
on its own, a non-linear independent component analysis of the sensory data
stream, all the time being continuously and autonomously active. This process
maps the independent components of the sensory input onto the attractor relics,
which acquire in this way a semantic meaning.
