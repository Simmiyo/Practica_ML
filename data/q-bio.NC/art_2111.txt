Phase-Oscillator Computations as Neural Models of Stimulus-Response
  Conditioning and Response Selection
The activity of collections of synchronizing neurons can be represented by
weakly coupled nonlinear phase oscillators satisfying Kuramoto's equations. In
this article, we build such neural-oscillator models, partly based on
neurophysiological evidence, to represent approximately the learning behavior
predicted and confirmed in three experiments by well-known stochastic learning
models of behavioral stimulus-response theory. We use three Kuramoto
oscillators to model a continuum of responses, and we provide detailed
numerical simulations and analysis of the three-oscillator Kuramoto problem,
including an analysis of the stability points for different coupling
conditions. We show that the oscillator simulation data are well-matched to the
behavioral data of the three experiments.
