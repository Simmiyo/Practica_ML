Rise of the humanbot
The accelerated path of technological development, particularly at the
interface between hardware and biology has been suggested as evidence for
future major technological breakthroughs associated to our potential to
overcome biological constraints. This includes the potential of becoming
immortal, having expanded cognitive capacities thanks to hardware implants or
the creation of intelligent machines. Here I argue that several relevant
evolutionary and structural constraints might prevent achieving most (if not
all) these innovations. Instead, the coming future will bring novelties that
will challenge many other aspects of our life and that can be seen as other
feasible singularities. One particularly important one has to do with the
evolving interactions between humans and non-intelligent robots capable of
learning and communication. Here I argue that a long term interaction can lead
to a new class of "agent" (the humanbot). The way shared memories get tangled
over time will inevitably have important consequences for both sides of the
pair, whose identity as separated entities might become blurred and ultimately
vanish. Understanding such hybrid systems requires a second-order neuroscience
approach while posing serious conceptual challenges, including the definition
of consciousness.
