Impact of exponential long range and Gaussian short range lateral
  connectivity on the distributed simulation of neural networks including up to
  30 billion synapses
Recent experimental neuroscience studies are pointing out the role of
long-range intra-areal connectivity that can be modeled by a distance dependent
exponential decay of the synaptic probability distribution. This short report
provides a preliminary measure of the impact of exponentially decaying lateral
connectivity compared to that of shorter-range Gaussian decays on the scaling
behaviour and memory occupation of a distributed spiking neural network
simulator (DPSNN). Two-dimensional grids of cortical columns composed by
point-like spiking neurons have been connected by up to 30 billion synapses
using exponential and Gaussian connectivity models. Up to 1024 hardware cores,
hosted on a 64 nodes server platform, executed the MPI processes composing the
distributed simulator. The hardware platform was a cluster of IBM NX360 M5
16-core compute nodes, each one containing two Intel Xeon Haswell 8-core
E5-2630 v3 processors, with a clock of 2.40GHz, interconnected through an
InfiniBand network. This study is conducted in the framework of the CORTICONIC
FET project, also in view of the next -to-start activities foreseen as part of
the Human Brain Project (HBP), SubProject 3 Cognitive and Systems Neuroscience,
WaveScalES work-package.
