Spatial Tactile Brain-Computer Interface Paradigm Applying Vibration
  Stimuli to Large Areas of User's Back
We aim at an augmentation of communication abilities of amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS) patients by creating a brain-computer interface (BCI) which can
control a computer or other device by using only brain activity. As a method,
we use a stimulus-driven BCI based on vibration stimuli delivered via a gaming
pad to the user's back. We identify P300 responses from brain activity data in
response to the vibration stimuli. The user's intentions are classified
according to the P300 responses recorded in the EEG. From the results of the
psychophysical and online BCI experiments, we are able to classify the P300
responses very accurately, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed
method.
