Competition through selective inhibitory synchrony
Models of cortical neuronal circuits commonly depend on inhibitory feedback
to control gain, provide signal normalization, and to selectively amplify
signals using winner-take-all (WTA) dynamics. Such models generally assume that
excitatory and inhibitory neurons are able to interact easily, because their
axons and dendrites are co-localized in the same small volume. However,
quantitative neuroanatomical studies of the dimensions of axonal and dendritic
trees of neurons in the neocortex show that this co-localization assumption is
not valid. In this paper we describe a simple modification to the WTA circuit
design that permits the effects of distributed inhibitory neurons to be coupled
through synchronization, and so allows a single WTA to be distributed widely in
cortical space, well beyond the arborization of any single inhibitory neuron,
and even across different cortical areas. We prove by non-linear contraction
analysis, and demonstrate by simulation that distributed WTA sub-systems
combined by such inhibitory synchrony are inherently stable. We show
analytically that synchronization is substantially faster than winner
selection. This circuit mechanism allows networks of independent WTAs to fully
or partially compete with each other.
