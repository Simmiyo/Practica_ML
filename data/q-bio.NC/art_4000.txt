A Tutorial in Connectome Analysis: Topological and Spatial Features of
  Brain Networks
High-throughput methods for yielding the set of connections in a neural
system, the connectome, are now being developed. This tutorial describes ways
to analyze the topological and spatial organization of the connectome at the
macroscopic level of connectivity between brain regions as well as the
microscopic level of connectivity between neurons. We will describe topological
features at three different levels: the local scale of individual nodes, the
regional scale of sets of nodes, and the global scale of the complete set of
nodes in a network. Such features can be used to characterize components of a
network and to compare different networks, e.g. the connectome of patients and
control subjects for clinical studies. At the global scale, different types of
networks can be distinguished and we will describe Erd\"os-R\'enyi random,
scale-free, small-world, modular, and hierarchical archetypes of networks.
Finally, the connectome also has a spatial organization and we describe methods
for analyzing wiring lengths of neural systems. As an introduction for new
researchers in the field of connectome analysis, we discuss the benefits and
limitations of each analysis approach.
