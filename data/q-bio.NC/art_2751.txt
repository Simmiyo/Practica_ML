BioSpaun: A large-scale behaving brain model with complex neurons
We describe a large-scale functional brain model that includes detailed,
conductance-based, compartmental models of individual neurons. We call the
model BioSpaun, to indicate the increased biological plausibility of these
neurons, and because it is a direct extension of the Spaun model
\cite{Eliasmith2012b}. We demonstrate that including these detailed
compartmental models does not adversely affect performance across a variety of
tasks, including digit recognition, serial working memory, and counting. We
then explore the effects of applying TTX, a sodium channel blocking drug, to
the model. We characterize the behavioral changes that result from this
molecular level intervention. We believe this is the first demonstration of a
large-scale brain model that clearly links low-level molecular interventions
and high-level behavior.
