Towards a new quantum cognition model
This article presents a new quantum-like model for cognition explicitly based
on knowledge. It is shown that this model, called QKT (quantum knowledge-based
theory), is able to coherently describe some experimental results that are
problematic for the prior quantum-like decision models. In particular, I
consider the experimental results relevant to the post-decision cognitive
dissonance, the problems relevant to the question order effect and response
replicability, and those relevant to the grand-reciprocity equations. A new set
of postulates is proposed, which evidence the different meaning given to the
projectors and to the quantum states. In the final part, I show that the use of
quantum gates can help to better describe and understand the evolution of
quantum-like models.
