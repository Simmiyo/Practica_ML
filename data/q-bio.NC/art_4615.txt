Social-sparsity brain decoders: faster spatial sparsity
Spatially-sparse predictors are good models for brain decoding: they give
accurate predictions and their weight maps are interpretable as they focus on a
small number of regions. However, the state of the art, based on total
variation or graph-net, is computationally costly. Here we introduce sparsity
in the local neighborhood of each voxel with social-sparsity, a structured
shrinkage operator. We find that, on brain imaging classification problems,
social-sparsity performs almost as well as total-variation models and better
than graph-net, for a fraction of the computational cost. It also very clearly
outlines predictive regions. We give details of the model and the algorithm.
