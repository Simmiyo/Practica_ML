State dependent computation using coupled recurrent networks
Although conditional branching between possible behavioural states is a
hallmark of intelligent behavior, very little is known about the neuronal
mechanisms that support this processing. In a step toward solving this problem
we demonstrate by theoretical analysis and simulation how networks of richly
inter-connected neurons, such as those observed in the superficial layers of
the neocortex, can embed reliable robust finite state machines. We show how a
multi-stable neuronal network containing a number of states can be created very
simply, by coupling two recurrent networks whose synaptic weights have been
configured for soft winner-take-all (sWTA) performance. These two sWTAs have
simple, homogenous locally recurrent connectivity except for a small fraction
of recurrent cross-connections between them, which are used to embed the
required states. This coupling between the maps allows the network to continue
to express the current state even after the input that elicted that state is
withdrawn. In addition, a small number of 'transition neurons' implement the
necessary input-driven transitions between the embedded states. We provide
simple rules to systematically design and construct neuronal state machines of
this kind. The significance of our finding is that it offers a method whereby
the cortex could construct networks supporting a broad range of sophisticated
processing by applying only small specializations to the same generic neuronal
circuit.
