Complexity of eye fixation duration time series in reading of Persian
  texts: A multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis
There is growing evidence that cognitive processes may have fractal
structures as a signature of complexity. It is an an ongoing topic of research
to study the class of complexity and how it may differ as a function of
cognitive variables. Here, we explore the eye movement trajectories generated
during reading different Persian texts. Features of eye movement trajectories
were recorded during reading Persian texts using an eye tracker. We show that
fixation durations, as the main components of eye movements reflecting
cognitive processing, exhibits multifractal behavior. This indicates that
multiple exponents are needed to capture the neural and cognitive processes
involved in decoding symbols to derive meaning. We test whether multifractal
behavior varies as a function of two different fonts, familiarity of the text
for readers, and reading silently or aloud, and goal-oriented versus
non-goal-oriented reading. We find that, while mean fixation duration is
affected by some of these factors, the multifractal pattern in time series of
eye fixation durations did not change significantly. Our results suggest that
multifractal dynamics may be intrinsic to the reading process.
