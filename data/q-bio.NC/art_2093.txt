Coupling continuous neural networks to the electromagnetic field in
  nervous tissue
We present a microscopic approach for the coupling of cortical activity, as
resulting from proper dipole currents of pyramidal neurons, to the
electromagnetic field in extracellular fluid in presence of diffusion and Ohmic
conduction. As a result, neural activity becomes represented by a continuous
neural field equation, while an observation model for electric field potentials
is obtained from the interaction of cortical dipole currents with charge
density in non-resistive extracellular space as described by the Nernst-Planck
equation.
