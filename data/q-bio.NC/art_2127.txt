A generalized theory for current-source density analysis in brain tissue
The current-source density (CSD) analysis is a widely used method in brain
electrophysiology, but this method rests on a series of assumptions, namely
that the surrounding extracellular medium is resistive and uniform, and in some
versions of the theory, that the current sources are exclusively made by
dipoles. Because of these assumptions, this standard model does not correctly
describe the contributions of monopolar sources or of non-resistive aspects of
the extracellular medium. We propose here a general framework to model electric
fields and potentials resulting from current source densities, without relying
on the above assumptions. We develop a mean-field formalism which is a
generalization of the standard model, and which can directly incorporate
non-resistive (non-ohmic) properties of the extracellular medium, such as ionic
diffusion effects. This formalism recovers the classic results of the standard
model such as the CSD analysis, but in addition, we provide expressions to
generalize the CSD approach to situations with non-resistive media and
arbitrarily complex multipolar configurations of current sources. We found that
the power spectrum of the signal contains the signature of the nature of
current sources and extracellular medium, which provides a direct way to
estimate those properties from experimental data, and in particular, estimate
the possible contribution of electric monopoles.
