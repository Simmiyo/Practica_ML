A Computational Model of Afterimages based on Simultaneous and
  Successive Contrasts
Negative afterimage appears in our vision when we shift our gaze from an over
stimulated original image to a new area with a uniform color. The colors of
negative afterimages differ from the old stimulating colors in the original
image when the color in the new area is either neutral or chromatic. The
interaction between stimulating colors in the test and inducing field in the
original image changes our color perception due to simultaneous contrast, and
the interaction between changed colors perceived in the previously-viewed field
and the color in the currently-viewed field also affects our perception of
colors in negative afterimages due to successive contrast. Based on these
observations we propose a computational model to estimate colors of negative
afterimages in more general cases where the original stimulating color in the
test field is chromatic, and the original stimulating color in the inducing
field and the new stimulating color can be either neutral or chromatic. We
validate our model with human experiments.
