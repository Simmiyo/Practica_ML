Biomimetic Space-Variant Sampling in a Vision Prosthesis Improves the
  User's Skill in a Localization Task
In this experiment, we test the hypothesis of whether a 'retina-like' space
variant sampling pattern can improve the efficiency of a visual prosthesis.
Subjects wearing a visuo-auditory substitution system were tested for their
ability to point at visual targets. The test group (space-variant sampling),
performed significantly better than the control group (uniform sampling). The
pointing accuracy was enhanced, as was the speed to find the target.
Surprisingly, the time spanned to complete the training was also reduced,
suggesting that this space-variant sampling scheme facilitates the mastering of
sensorimotor contingencies.
