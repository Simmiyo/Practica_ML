Chimera States and Seizures in a Mouse Neuronal Model
Chimera states---the coexistence of synchrony and asynchrony in a
nonlocally-coupled network of identical oscillators---are often used as a model
framework for epileptic seizures. Here, we explore the dynamics of chimera
states in a network of modified Hindmarsh-Rose neurons, configured to reflect
the graph of the mesoscale mouse connectome. Our model produces superficially
epileptiform activity converging on persistent chimera states in a large region
of a two-parameter space governing connections (a) between subcortices within a
cortex and (b) between cortices. Our findings contribute to a growing body of
literature suggesting mathematical models can qualitatively reproduce epileptic
seizure dynamics.
