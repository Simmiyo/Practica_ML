Conjunction and Negation of Natural Concepts: A Quantum-theoretic
  Modeling
We perform two experiments with the aim to investigate the effects of
negation on the combination of natural concepts. In the first experiment, we
test the membership weights of a list of exemplars with respect to two
concepts, e.g., {\it Fruits} and {\it Vegetables}, and their conjunction {\it
Fruits And Vegetables}. In the second experiment, we test the membership
weights of the same list of exemplars with respect to the same two concepts,
but negating the second, e.g., {\it Fruits} and {\it Not Vegetables}, and again
their conjunction {\it Fruits And Not Vegetables}. The collected data confirm
existing results on conceptual combination, namely, they show dramatic
deviations from the predictions of classical (fuzzy set) logic and probability
theory. More precisely, they exhibit conceptual vagueness, gradeness of
membership, overextension and double overextension of membership weights with
respect to the given conjunctions. Then, we show that the quantum probability
model in Fock space recently elaborated to model Hampton's data on concept
conjunction (Hampton, 1988a) and disjunction (Hampton, 1988b) faithfully
accords with the collected data. Our quantum-theoretic modeling enables to
describe these non-classical effects in terms of genuine quantum effects,
namely `contextuality', `superposition', `interference' and `emergence'. The
obtained results confirm and strenghten the analysis in Aerts (2009a) and Sozzo
(2014) on the identification of quantum aspects in experiments on conceptual
vagueness. Our results can be inserted within the general research on the
identification of quantum structures in cognitive and decision processes.
