Eye movement simulation and detector creation to reduce laborious
  parameter adjustments
Eye movements hold information about human perception, intention and
cognitive state. Various algorithms have been proposed to identify and
distinguish eye movements, particularly fixations, saccades, and smooth
pursuits. A major drawback of existing algorithms is that they rely on accurate
and constant sampling rates, impeding straightforward adaptation to new
movements such as micro saccades. We propose a novel eye movement simulator
that i) probabilistically simulates saccade movements as gamma distributions
considering different peak velocities and ii) models smooth pursuit onsets with
the sigmoid function. This simulator is combined with a machine learning
approach to create detectors for general and specific velocity profiles.
Additionally, our approach is capable of using any sampling rate, even with
fluctuations. The machine learning approach consists of different binary
patterns combined using conditional distributions. The simulation is evaluated
against publicly available real data using a squared error, and the detectors
are evaluated against state-of-the-art algorithms.
