Cell assemblies at multiple time scales with arbitrary lag
  constellations
Hebb's idea of a cell assembly as the fundamental unit of neural information
processing has dominated neuroscience like no other theoretical concept within
the past 60 years. A range of different physiological phenomena, from precisely
synchronized spiking to broadly simultaneous rate increases, has been subsumed
under this term. Yet progress in this area is hampered by the lack of
statistical tools that would enable to extract assemblies with arbitrary
constellations of time lags, and at multiple temporal scales, partly due to the
severe computational burden. Here we present such a unifying methodological and
conceptual framework which detects assembly structure at many different time
scales, levels of precision, and with arbitrary internal organization. Applying
this methodology to multiple single unit recordings from various cortical
areas, we find that there is no universal cortical coding scheme, but that
assembly structure and precision significantly depends on brain area recorded
and ongoing task demands.
