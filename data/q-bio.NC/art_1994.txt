The Influence of Sodium and Potassium Dynamics on Excitability,
  Seizures, and the Stability of Persistent States: I. Single Neuron Dynamics
In these companion papers, we study how the interrelated dynamics of sodium
and potassium affect the excitability of neurons, the occurrence of seizures,
and the stability of persistent states of activity. In this first paper, we
construct a mathematical model consisting of a single conductance-based neuron
together with intra- and extracellular ion concentration dynamics. We formulate
a reduction of this model that permits a detailed bifurcation analysis, and
show that the reduced model is a reasonable approximation of the full model. We
find that competition between intrinsic neuronal currents, sodium-potassium
pumps, glia, and diffusion can produce very slow and large-amplitude
oscillations in ion concentrations similar to what is seen physiologically in
seizures. Using the reduced model, we identify the dynamical mechanisms that
give rise to these phenomena. These models reveal several experimentally
testable predictions. Our work emphasizes the critical role of ion
concentration homeostasis in the proper functioning of neurons, and points to
important fundamental processes that may underlie pathological states such as
epilepsy.
