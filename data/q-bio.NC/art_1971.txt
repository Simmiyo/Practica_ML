Dynamics of Neural Networks with Continuous Attractors
We investigate the dynamics of continuous attractor neural networks (CANNs).
Due to the translational invariance of their neuronal interactions, CANNs can
hold a continuous family of stationary states. We systematically explore how
their neutral stability facilitates the tracking performance of a CANN, which
is believed to have wide applications in brain functions. We develop a
perturbative approach that utilizes the dominant movement of the network
stationary states in the state space. We quantify the distortions of the bump
shape during tracking, and study their effects on the tracking performance.
Results are obtained on the maximum speed for a moving stimulus to be
trackable, and the reaction time to catch up an abrupt change in stimulus.
