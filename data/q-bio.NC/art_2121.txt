Pacer cell response to periodic Zeitgebers
Almost all organisms show some kind of time periodicity in their behavior.
Especially in mammals the neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus form a
biological clock regulating the activity-inactivity cycle of the animal. This
clock is stimulated by the natural 24-hour light-dark cycle. In our model of
this system we consider each neuron as a so called phase oscillator, coupled to
other neurons for which the light-dark cycle is a Zeitgeber. To simplify the
model we first take an externally stimulated single phase oscillator. The first
part of the phase interval is called the active state and the remaining part is
the inactive state. Without external stimulus the oscillator oscillates with
its intrinsic period. An external stimulus, be it from activity of neighboring
cells or the periodic daylight cycle, acts twofold, it may delay the change
form active to inactive and it may advance the return to the active state. The
amount of delay and advance depends on the strength of the stimulus. We use a
circle map as a mathematical model for this system. This map depends on several
parameters, among which the intrinsic period and phase delay and advance. In
parameter space we find Arnol'd tongues where the system is in resonance with
the Zeitgeber. Thus already in this simplified system we find entrainment and
synchronization. Also some other phenomena from biological experiments and
observations can be related to the dynamical behavior of the circle map.
