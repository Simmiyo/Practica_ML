Gestalt Phenomenon in Music? A Neurocognitive Physics Study with EEG
The term gestalt has been widely used in the field of psychology which
defined the perception of human mind to group any object not in part but as a
unified whole. Music in general is polytonic i.e. a combination of a number of
pure tones (frequencies) mixed together in a manner that sounds harmonius. The
study of human brain response due to different frequency groups of acoustic
signal can give us an excellent insight regarding the neural and functional
architecture of brain functions. In this work we have tried to analyze the
effect of different frequency bands of music on the various frequency rhythms
of human brain obtained from EEG data of 5 participants. Four (4) widely
popular Rabindrasangeet clips were subjected to Wavelet Transform method for
extracting five resonant frequency bands from the original music signal. These
resonant frequency bands were presented to the subjects as auditory stimulus
and EEG signals recorded simultaneously in 19 different locations of the brain.
The recorded EEG signals were noise cleaned and subjected to Multifractal
Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA) technique on the alpha, theta and gamma
frequency range. Thus, we obtained the complexity values (in the form of
multifractal spectral width) in alpha, theta and gamma EEG rhythms
corresponding to different frequency bands of music. We obtain frequency
specific arousal based response in different lobes of brain as well as in
specific EEG bands corresponding to musical stimuli. This revelation can be of
immense importance when it comes to the field of cognitive music therapy.
