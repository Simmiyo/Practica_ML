Finite Volume Model to Study Calcium Diffusion in Neuron Involving JRYR,
  JSERCA and JLEAK
Calcium dynamics is the highly responsible for intracellular electrical
(action potential) and chemical (neurotransmitter) signaling in neuron cell.
The Mathematical modeling of calcium dynamics in neurons lead to the reaction
diffusion equation which involves the parameters like diffusion coefficient,
free calcium, bound calcium, buffers and bound buffer. Here the parameters like
receptors, serca and leak are also incorporated in the model. Appropriate
boundary conditions have been framed based on biophysical conditions of the
problem. The finite volume method has been employed to obtain the solution. The
computer program has been developed using MATLAB 7.11 for the entire problem to
compute Ca2+ profiles and study the relationships among various parameters.
