Comparison of P300 Responses in Auditory, Visual and Audiovisual Spatial
  Speller BCI Paradigms
The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive test of three spatial
speller settings, for the auditory, visual, and audiovisual paradigms. For
rigour, the study is conducted with 16 BCI-na\"ive subjects in an experimental
set-up based on five Japanese hiragana characters. Auditory P300 responses give
encouragingly longer target vs. non-target latencies during the training phase,
however, real-world online BCI experiments in the multimodal setting do not
validate this potential advantage. Our case studies indicate that the auditory
spatial unimodal paradigm needs further development in order to be a viable
alternative to the established visual domain speller applications, as far as
BCI-na\"ive subjects are concerned.
