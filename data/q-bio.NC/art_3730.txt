Learning by message-passing in networks of discrete synapses
We show that a message-passing process allows to store in binary "material"
synapses a number of random patterns which almost saturates the information
theoretic bounds. We apply the learning algorithm to networks characterized by
a wide range of different connection topologies and of size comparable with
that of biological systems (e.g. $n\simeq10^{5}-10^{6}$). The algorithm can be
turned into an on-line --fault tolerant-- learning protocol of potential
interest in modeling aspects of synaptic plasticity and in building
neuromorphic devices.
