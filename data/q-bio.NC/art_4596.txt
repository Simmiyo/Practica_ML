Info-Clustering: A Mathematical Theory for Data Clustering
We formulate an info-clustering paradigm based on a multivariate information
measure, called multivariate mutual information, that naturally extends
Shannon's mutual information between two random variables to the multivariate
case involving more than two random variables. With proper model reductions, we
show that the paradigm can be applied to study the human genome and connectome
in a more meaningful way than the conventional algorithmic approach. Not only
can info-clustering provide justifications and refinements to some existing
techniques, but it also inspires new computationally feasible solutions.
