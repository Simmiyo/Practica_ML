Airborne Ultrasonic Tactile Display Brain-computer Interface -- A Small
  Robotic Arm Online Control Study
We report on an extended robot control application of a contact-less and
airborne ultrasonic tactile display (AUTD) stimulus-based brain-computer
interface (BCI) paradigm, which received last year The Annual BCI Research
Award 2014. In the award winning human communication augmentation paradigm the
six palm positions are used to evoke somatosensory brain responses, in order to
define a novel contactless tactile BCI. An example application of a small robot
management is also presented in which the users control a small robot online.
