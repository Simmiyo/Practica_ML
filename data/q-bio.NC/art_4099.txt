A decaying factor accounts for contained activity in neuronal networks
  with no need of hierarchical or modular organization
The mechanisms responsible for contention of activity in systems represented
by networks are crucial in various phenomena, as in diseases such as epilepsy
that affects the neuronal networks, and for information dissemination in social
networks. The first models to account for contained activity included
triggering and inhibition processes, but they cannot be applied to social
networks where inhibition is clearly absent. A recent model showed that
contained activity can be achieved with no need of inhibition processes
provided that the network is subdivided in modules (communities). In this
paper, we introduce a new concept inspired in the Hebbian theory through which
activity contention is reached by incorporating a dynamics based on a decaying
activity in a random walk mechanism preferential to the node activity. Upon
selecting the decay coefficient within a proper range, we observed sustained
activity in all the networks tested, viz. random, Barabasi-Albert and
geographical networks. The generality of this finding was confirmed by showing
that modularity is no longer needed if the dynamics based on the
integrate-and-fire dynamics incorporated the decay factor. Taken together,
these results provide a proof of principle that persistent, restrained network
activation might occur in the absence of any particular topological structure.
This may be the reason why neuronal activity does not outspread to the entire
neuronal network, even when no special topological organization exists.
