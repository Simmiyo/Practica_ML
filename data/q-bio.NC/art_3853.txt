Reliability of Layered Neural Oscillator Networks
We study the reliability of large networks of coupled neural oscillators in
response to fluctuating stimuli. Reliability means that a stimulus elicits
essentially identical responses upon repeated presentations. We view the
problem on two scales: neuronal reliability, which concerns the repeatability
of spike times of individual neurons embedded within a network, and
pooled-response reliability, which addresses the repeatability of the total
synaptic output from the network. We find that individual embedded neurons can
be reliable or unreliable depending on network conditions, whereas pooled
responses of sufficiently large networks are mostly reliable. We study also the
effects of noise, and find that some types affect reliability more seriously
than others.
