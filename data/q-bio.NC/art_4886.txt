Superconducting Optoelectronic Neurons II: Receiver Circuits
Circuits using superconducting single-photon detectors and Josephson
junctions to perform signal reception, synaptic weighting, and integration are
investigated. The circuits convert photon-detection events into flux quanta,
the number of which is determined by the synaptic weight. The current from many
synaptic connections is inductively coupled to a superconducting loop that
implements the neuronal threshold operation. Designs are presented for synapses
and neurons that perform integration as well as detect coincidence events for
temporal coding. Both excitatory and inhibitory connections are demonstrated.
It is shown that a neuron with a single integration loop can receive input from
1000 such synaptic connections, and neurons of similar design could employ many
loops for dendritic processing.
