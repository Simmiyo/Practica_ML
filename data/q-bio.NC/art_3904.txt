The spike train statistics for consonant and dissonant musical accords
The simple system composed of three neural-like noisy elements is considered.
Two of them (sensory neurons or sensors) are stimulated by noise and periodic
signals with different ratio of frequencies, and the third one (interneuron)
receives the output of these two sensors and noise. We propose the analytical
approach to analysis of Interspike Intervals (ISI) statistics of the spike
train generated by the interneuron. The ISI distributions of the sensory
neurons are considered to be known. The frequencies of the input sinusoidal
signals are in ratios, which are usual for music. We show that in the case of
small integer ratios (musical consonance) the input pair of sinusoids results
in the ISI distribution appropriate for more regular output spike train than in
a case of large integer ratios (musical dissonance) of input frequencies. These
effects are explained from the viewpoint of the proposed theory.
