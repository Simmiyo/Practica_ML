Can a Computer Laugh ?
A computer model of "a sense of humour" suggested previously
[arXiv:0711.2058,0711.2061], relating the humorous effect with a specific
malfunction in information processing, is given in somewhat different
exposition. Psychological aspects of humour are elaborated more thoroughly. The
mechanism of laughter is formulated on the more general level. Detailed
discussion is presented for the higher levels of information processing, which
are responsible for a perception of complex samples of humour. Development of a
sense of humour in the process of evolution is discussed.
