Pinwheel stabilization by ocular dominance segregation
We present an analytical approach for studying the coupled development of
ocular dominance and orientation preference columns. Using this approach we
demonstrate that ocular dominance segregation can induce the stabilization and
even the production of pinwheels by their crystallization in two types of
periodic lattices. Pinwheel crystallization depends on the overall dominance of
one eye over the other, a condition that is fulfilled during early cortical
development. Increasing the strength of inter-map coupling induces a transition
from pinwheel-free stripe solutions to intermediate and high pinwheel density
states.
