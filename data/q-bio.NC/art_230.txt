Cognition and Emotion: Perspectives of a Closing Gap
The primary tasks of a cognitive system is to survive and to maximize a
life-long utility function, like the number of offsprings. A direct
computational maximization of life-long utility is however not possible in
complex environments, especially in the context, of real-world time
constraints. The central role of emotions is to serve as an intermediate layer
in the space of policies available to agents and animals, leading to a large
dimensional reduction of complexity.
  We review our current understanding of the functional role of emotions,
stressing the role of the neuromodulators mediating emotions for the diffusive
homeostatic control system of the brain. We discuss a recent proposal, that
emotional diffusive control is characterized, in contrast to neutral diffusive
control, by interaction effects, viz by interferences between emotional arousal
and reward signaling. Several proposals for the realization of synthetic
emotions are discussed in this context, together with key open issues regarding
the interplay between emotional motivational drives and diffusive control.
