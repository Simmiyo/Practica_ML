Two-step Input Spatial Auditory BCI for Japanese Kana Characters
We present an auditory stimulus optimization and a pilot study of a two-step
input speller application combined with a spatial auditory brain-computer
interface (saBCI) for paralyzed users. The application has been developed for
45, out of 48 defining the full set, Japanese kana characters in a two-step
input procedure setting for an easy-to-use BCI-speller interface. The user
first selects the representative letter of a subset, defining the second step.
In the second step, the final choice is made. At each interfacing step, the
choices are classified based on the P300 event related potential (ERP)
responses captured in the EEG, as in the classic oddball paradigm. The BCI
online experiment and EEG responses classification results of the pilot study
confirm the effectiveness of the proposed spelling method.
