Visual pathways from the perspective of cost functions and multi-task
  deep neural networks
Vision research has been shaped by the seminal insight that we can understand
the higher-tier visual cortex from the perspective of multiple functional
pathways with different goals. In this paper, we try to give a computational
account of the functional organization of this system by reasoning from the
perspective of multi-task deep neural networks. Machine learning has shown that
tasks become easier to solve when they are decomposed into subtasks with their
own cost function. We hypothesize that the visual system optimizes multiple
cost functions of unrelated tasks and this causes the emergence of a ventral
pathway dedicated to vision for perception, and a dorsal pathway dedicated to
vision for action. To evaluate the functional organization in multi-task deep
neural networks, we propose a method that measures the contribution of a unit
towards each task, applying it to two networks that have been trained on either
two related or two unrelated tasks, using an identical stimulus set. Results
show that the network trained on the unrelated tasks shows a decreasing degree
of feature representation sharing towards higher-tier layers while the network
trained on related tasks uniformly shows high degree of sharing. We conjecture
that the method we propose can be used to analyze the anatomical and functional
organization of the visual system and beyond. We predict that the degree to
which tasks are related is a good descriptor of the degree to which they share
downstream cortical-units.
