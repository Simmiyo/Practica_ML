Existence and Stability of Standing Pulses in Neural Networks : I
  Existence
We consider the existence of standing pulse solutions of a neural network
integro-differential equation. These pulses are bistable with the zero state
and may be an analogue for short term memory in the brain. The network consists
of a single-layer of neurons synaptically connected by lateral inhibition. Our
work extends the classic Amari result by considering a non-saturating gain
function. We consider a specific connectivity function where the existence
conditions for single-pulses can be reduced to the solution of an algebraic
system. In addition to the two localized pulse solutions found by Amari, we
find that three or more pulses can coexist. We also show the existence of
nonconvex ``dimpled'' pulses and double pulses. We map out the pulse shapes and
maximum firing rates for different connection weights and gain functions.
