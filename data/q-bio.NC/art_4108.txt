Critical brain dynamics at large scale
Highly correlated brain dynamics produces synchronized states with no
behavioral value, while weakly correlated dynamics prevent information flow. In
between these states, the unique dynamical features of the critical state endow
the brain with properties which are fundamental for adaptive behavior. We
discuss the idea put forward two decades ago by Per Bak that the working brain
stays at an intermediate (critical) regime characterized by power-law
correlations. This proposal is now supported by a wide body of empirical
evidence at different scales demonstrating that the spatiotemporal brain
dynamics exhibit key signatures of critical dynamics, previously recognized in
other complex systems. The rationale behind this program is discussed in these
notes, followed by an account of the most recent results.
