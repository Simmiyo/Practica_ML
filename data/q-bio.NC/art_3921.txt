Non-equilibrium dynamics of stochastic point processes with
  refractoriness
Stochastic point processes with refractoriness appear frequently in the
quantitative analysis of physical and biological systems, such as the
generation of action potentials by nerve cells, the release and reuptake of
vesicles at a synapse, and the counting of particles by detector devices. Here
we present an extension of renewal theory to describe ensembles of point
processes with time varying input. This is made possible by a representation in
terms of occupation numbers of two states: Active and refractory. The dynamics
of these occupation numbers follows a distributed delay differential equation.
In particular, our theory enables us to uncover the effect of refractoriness on
the time-dependent rate of an ensemble of encoding point processes in response
to modulation of the input. We present exact solutions that demonstrate generic
features, such as stochastic transients and oscillations in the step response
as well as resonances, phase jumps and frequency doubling in the transfer of
periodic signals. We show that a large class of renewal processes can indeed be
regarded as special cases of the model we analyze. Hence our approach
represents a widely applicable framework to define and analyze non-stationary
renewal processes.
