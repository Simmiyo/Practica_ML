Annotating Synapses in Large EM Datasets
Reconstructing neuronal circuits at the level of synapses is a central
problem in neuroscience and becoming a focus of the emerging field of
connectomics. To date, electron microscopy (EM) is the most proven technique
for identifying and quantifying synaptic connections. As advances in EM make
acquiring larger datasets possible, subsequent manual synapse identification
({\em i.e.}, proofreading) for deciphering a connectome becomes a major time
bottleneck. Here we introduce a large-scale, high-throughput, and
semi-automated methodology to efficiently identify synapses. We successfully
applied our methodology to the Drosophila medulla optic lobe, annotating many
more synapses than previous connectome efforts. Our approaches are extensible
and will make the often complicated process of synapse identification
accessible to a wider-community of potential proofreaders.
