Computing Motion with 3D Memristive Grid
Computing the relative motion of objects is an important navigation task that
we routinely perform by relying on inherently unreliable biological cells in
the retina. The non-linear and adaptive response of memristive devices make
them excellent building blocks for realizing complex synaptic-like
architectures that are common in the human retina. Here, we introduce a novel
memristive thresholding scheme that facilitates the detection of moving edges.
In addition, a double-layered 3-D memristive network is employed for modeling
the motion computations that take place in both the Outer Plexiform Layer (OPL)
and Inner Plexiform Layer (IPL) that enables the detection of on-center and
off-center transient responses. Applying the transient detection results, it is
shown that it is possible to generate an estimation of the speed and direction
a moving object.
