SynapCountJ --- a Tool for Analyzing Synaptic Densities in Neurons
The quantification of synapses is instrumental to measure the evolution of
synaptic densities of neurons under the effect of some physiological
conditions, neuronal diseases or even drug treatments. However, the manual
quantification of synapses is a tedious, error-prone, time-consuming and
subjective task; therefore, tools that might automate this process are
desirable. In this paper, we present SynapCountJ, an ImageJ plugin, that can
measure synaptic density of individual neurons obtained by immunofluorescence
techniques, and also can be applied for batch processing of neurons that have
been obtained in the same experiment or using the same setting. The procedure
to quantify synapses implemented in SynapCountJ is based on the colocalization
of three images of the same neuron (the neuron marked with two antibody markers
and the structure of the neuron) and is inspired by methods coming from
Computational Algebraic Topology. SynapCountJ provides a procedure to
semi-automatically quantify the number of synapses of neuron cultures; as a
result, the time required for such an analysis is greatly reduced.
