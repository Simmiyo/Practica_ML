Brain and Cognitive Reserve: Translation via Network Control Theory
Traditional approaches to understanding the brain's resilience to
neuropathology have identified neurophysiological variables, often described as
brain or cognitive 'reserve,' associated with better outcomes. However,
mechanisms of function and resilience in large-scale brain networks remain
poorly understood. Dynamic network theory may provide a basis for substantive
advances in understanding functional resilience in the human brain. In this
perspective, we describe recent theoretical approaches from network control
theory as a framework for investigating network level mechanisms underlying
cognitive function and the dynamics of neuroplasticity in the human brain. We
describe the theoretical opportunities offered by the application of network
control theory at the level of the human connectome to understand cognitive
resilience and inform translational intervention.
