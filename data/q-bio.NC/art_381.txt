Learning and comparing functional connectomes across subjects
Functional connectomes capture brain interactions via synchronized
fluctuations in the functional magnetic resonance imaging signal. If measured
during rest, they map the intrinsic functional architecture of the brain. With
task-driven experiments they represent integration mechanisms between
specialized brain areas. Analyzing their variability across subjects and
conditions can reveal markers of brain pathologies and mechanisms underlying
cognition. Methods of estimating functional connectomes from the imaging signal
have undergone rapid developments and the literature is full of diverse
strategies for comparing them. This review aims to clarify links across
functional-connectivity methods as well as to expose different steps to perform
a group study of functional connectomes.
