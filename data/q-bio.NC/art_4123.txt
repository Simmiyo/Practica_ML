Biologically Inspired Spiking Neurons : Piecewise Linear Models and
  Digital Implementation
There has been a strong push recently to examine biological scale simulations
of neuromorphic algorithms to achieve stronger inference capabilities. This
paper presents a set of piecewise linear spiking neuron models, which can
reproduce different behaviors, similar to the biological neuron, both for a
single neuron as well as a network of neurons. The proposed models are
investigated, in terms of digital implementation feasibility and costs,
targeting large scale hardware implementation. Hardware synthesis and physical
implementations on FPGA show that the proposed models can produce precise
neural behaviors with higher performance and considerably lower implementation
costs compared with the original model. Accordingly, a compact structure of the
models which can be trained with supervised and unsupervised learning
algorithms has been developed. Using this structure and based on a spike rate
coding, a character recognition case study has been implemented and tested.
