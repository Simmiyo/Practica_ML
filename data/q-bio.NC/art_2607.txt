A specialized face-processing network consistent with the
  representational geometry of monkey face patches
Ample evidence suggests that face processing in human and non-human primates
is performed differently compared with other objects. Converging reports, both
physiologically and psychophysically, indicate that faces are processed in
specialized neural networks in the brain -i.e. face patches in monkeys and the
fusiform face area (FFA) in humans. We are all expert face-processing agents,
and able to identify very subtle differences within the category of faces,
despite substantial visual and featural similarities. Identification is
performed rapidly and accurately after viewing a whole face, while
significantly drops if some of the face configurations (e.g. inversion,
misalignment) are manipulated or if partial views of faces are shown due to
occlusion. This refers to a hotly-debated, yet highly-supported concept, known
as holistic face processing. We built a hierarchical computational model of
face-processing based on evidence from recent neuronal and behavioural studies
on faces processing in primates. Representational geometries of the last three
layers of the model have characteristics similar to those observed in monkey
face patches (posterior, middle and anterior patches). Furthermore, several
face-processing-related phenomena reported in the literature automatically
emerge as properties of this model. The representations are evolved through
several computational layers, using biologically plausible learning rules. The
model satisfies face inversion effect, composite face effect, other race
effect, view and identity selectivity, and canonical face views. To our
knowledge, no models have so far been proposed with this performance and
agreement with biological data.
