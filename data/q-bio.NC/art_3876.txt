Free actions and Grassmanian variety
An algebraic notion of representational consistency is defined. A theorem
relating it to free actions is proved. A metrizability problem of the quotient
(a shape space) is discussed. This leads to a new algebraic variety with a
metrizability result. A concrete example is given from stereo vision.
