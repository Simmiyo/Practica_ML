The intrinsic value of HFO features as a biomarker of epileptic activity
High frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a promising biomarker of epileptic
brain tissue and activity. HFOs additionally serve as a prototypical example of
challenges in the analysis of discrete events in high-temporal resolution,
intracranial EEG data. Two primary challenges are 1) dimensionality reduction,
and 2) assessing feasibility of classification. Dimensionality reduction
assumes that the data lie on a manifold with dimension less than that of the
feature space. However, previous HFO analyses have assumed a linear manifold,
global across time, space (i.e. recording electrode/channel), and individual
patients. Instead, we assess both a) whether linear methods are appropriate and
b) the consistency of the manifold across time, space, and patients. We also
estimate bounds on the Bayes classification error to quantify the distinction
between two classes of HFOs (those occurring during seizures and those
occurring due to other processes). This analysis provides the foundation for
future clinical use of HFO features and buides the analysis for other discrete
events, such as individual action potentials or multi-unit activity.
