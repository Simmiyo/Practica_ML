Maximum Performance at Minimum Cost in Network Synchronization
We consider two optimization problems on synchronization of oscillator
networks: maximization of synchronizability and minimization of synchronization
cost. We first develop an extension of the well-known master stability
framework to the case of non-diagonalizable Laplacian matrices. We then show
that the solution sets of the two optimization problems coincide and are
simultaneously characterized by a simple condition on the Laplacian
eigenvalues. Among the optimal networks, we identify a subclass of hierarchical
networks, characterized by the absence of feedback loops and the normalization
of inputs. We show that most optimal networks are directed and
non-diagonalizable, necessitating the extension of the framework. We also show
how oriented spanning trees can be used to explicitly and systematically
construct optimal networks under network topological constraints. Our results
may provide insights into the evolutionary origin of structures in complex
networks for which synchronization plays a significant role.
