Predator confusion is sufficient to evolve swarming behavior
Swarming behaviors in animals have been extensively studied due to their
implications for the evolution of cooperation, social cognition, and
predator-prey dynamics. An important goal of these studies is discerning which
evolutionary pressures favor the formation of swarms. One hypothesis is that
swarms arise because the presence of multiple moving prey in swarms causes
confusion for attacking predators, but it remains unclear how important this
selective force is. Using an evolutionary model of a predator-prey system, we
show that predator confusion provides a sufficient selection pressure to evolve
swarming behavior in prey. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the evolutionary
effect of predator confusion on prey could in turn exert pressure on the
structure of the predator's visual field, favoring the frontally oriented,
high-resolution visual systems commonly observed in predators that feed on
swarming animals. Finally, we provide evidence that when prey evolve swarming
in response to predator confusion, there is a change in the shape of the
functional response curve describing the predator's consumption rate as prey
density increases. Thus, we show that a relatively simple perceptual
constraint--predator confusion--could have pervasive evolutionary effects on
prey behavior, predator sensory mechanisms, and the ecological interactions
between predators and prey.
