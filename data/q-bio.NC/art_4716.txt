SIM-CE: An Advanced Simulink Platform for Studying the Brain of
  Caenorhabditis elegans
We introduce SIM-CE, an advanced, user-friendly modeling and simulation
environment in Simulink for performing multi-scale behavioral analysis of the
nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). SIM-CE contains an
implementation of the mathematical models of C. elegans's neurons and synapses,
in Simulink, which can be easily extended and particularized by the user. The
Simulink model is able to capture both complex dynamics of ion channels and
additional biophysical detail such as intracellular calcium concentration. We
demonstrate the performance of SIM-CE by carrying out neuronal, synaptic and
neural-circuit-level behavioral simulations. Such environment enables the user
to capture unknown properties of the neural circuits, test hypotheses and
determine the origin of many behavioral plasticities exhibited by the worm.
