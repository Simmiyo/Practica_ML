Neural Mechanism of Language
This paper is based on our previous work on neural coding. It is a
self-organized model supported by existing evidences. Firstly, we briefly
introduce this model in this paper, and then we explain the neural mechanism of
language and reasoning with it. Moreover, we find that the position of an area
determines its importance. Specifically, language relevant areas are in the
capital position of the cortical kingdom. Therefore they are closely related
with autonomous consciousness and working memories. In essence, language is a
miniature of the real world. Briefly, this paper would like to bridge the gap
between molecule mechanism of neurons and advanced functions such as language
and reasoning.
