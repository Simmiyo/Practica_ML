Evidence for Dynamic Excitation-Inhibition Ratio in Networks of Cortical
  Neurons
In this report trial-to-trial variations in the synchronized responses of
neural networks are offered as evidence for excitation-inhibition ratio being a
dynamic variable over time scales of minutes. Synchronized network responses to
stimuli were studied in ex-vivo large scale cortical networks. We show that
sub-second measures of the individual synchronous response, namely -- its
latency and decay duration, are related to minutes-scale network response
dynamics. Network responsiveness is reflected as residency in, or shifting
amongst, areas of the latency-decay plane. The different sensitivities of
latency and decay durations to synaptic blockers imply that these two measures
reflect the effective impacts of inhibitory and excitatory neuronal populations
on response dynamics. Taken together, the data suggest that network response
variations under repeated stimuli result from excitation-inhibition ratio being
a dynamic variable rather than a parameter.
