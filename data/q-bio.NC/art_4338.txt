Sparse Bayesian Learning for EEG Source Localization
Purpose: Localizing the sources of electrical activity from
electroencephalographic (EEG) data has gained considerable attention over the
last few years. In this paper, we propose an innovative source localization
method for EEG, based on Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL). Methods: To better
specify the sparsity profile and to ensure efficient source localization, the
proposed approach considers grouping of the electrical current dipoles inside
human brain. SBL is used to solve the localization problem in addition with
imposed constraint that the electric current dipoles associated with the brain
activity are isotropic. Results: Numerical experiments are conducted on a
realistic head model that is obtained by segmentation of MRI images of the head
and includes four major components, namely the scalp, the skull, the
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the brain, with appropriate relative conductivity
values. The results demonstrate that the isotropy constraint significantly
improves the performance of SBL. In a noiseless environment, the proposed
method was 1 found to accurately (with accuracy of >75%) locate up to 6
simultaneously active sources, whereas for SBL without the isotropy constraint,
the accuracy of finding just 3 simultaneously active sources was <75%.
Conclusions: Compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed method
is potentially more consistent in specifying the sparsity profile of human
brain activity and is able to produce better source localization for EEG.
