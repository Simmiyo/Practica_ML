Evolving Networks and the Development of Neural Systems
It is now generally assumed that the heterogeneity of most networks in nature
probably arises via preferential attachment of some sort. However, the origin
of various other topological features, such as degree-degree correlations and
related characteristics, is often not clear and attributed to specific
functional requirements. We show how it is possible to analyse a very general
scenario in which nodes gain or lose edges according to any (e.g., nonlinear)
functions of local and/or global degree information. Applying our method to two
rather different examples of brain development -- synaptic pruning in humans
and the neural network of the worm C. Elegans -- we find that simple
biologically motivated assumptions lead to very good agreement with
experimental data. In particular, many nontrivial topological features of the
worm's brain arise naturally at a critical point.
