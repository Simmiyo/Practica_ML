Using inspiration from synaptic plasticity rules to optimize traffic
  flow in distributed engineered networks
Controlling the flow and routing of data is a fundamental problem in many
distributed networks, including transportation systems, integrated circuits,
and the Internet. In the brain, synaptic plasticity rules have been discovered
that regulate network activity in response to environmental inputs, which
enable circuits to be stable yet flexible. Here, we develop a new
neuro-inspired model for network flow control that only depends on modifying
edge weights in an activity-dependent manner. We show how two fundamental
plasticity rules (long-term potentiation and long-term depression) can be cast
as a distributed gradient descent algorithm for regulating traffic flow in
engineered networks. We then characterize, both via simulation and
analytically, how different forms of edge-weight update rules affect network
routing efficiency and robustness. We find a close correspondence between
certain classes of synaptic weight update rules derived experimentally in the
brain and rules commonly used in engineering, suggesting common principles to
both.
