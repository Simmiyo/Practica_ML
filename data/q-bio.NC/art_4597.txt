Compression and the origins of Zipf's law for word frequencies
Here we sketch a new derivation of Zipf's law for word frequencies based on
optimal coding. The structure of the derivation is reminiscent of Mandelbrot's
random typing model but it has multiple advantages over random typing: (1) it
starts from realistic cognitive pressures (2) it does not require fine tuning
of parameters and (3) it sheds light on the origins of other statistical laws
of language and thus can lead to a compact theory of linguistic laws. Our
findings suggest that the recurrence of Zipf's law in human languages could
originate from pressure for easy and fast communication.
