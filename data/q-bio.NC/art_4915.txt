A simple blind-denoising filter inspired by electrically coupled
  photoreceptors in the retina
Photoreceptors in the retina are coupled by electrical synapses called "gap
junctions". It has long been established that gap junctions increase the
signal-to-noise ratio of photoreceptors. Inspired by electrically coupled
photoreceptors, we introduced a simple filter, the PR-filter, with only one
variable. On BSD68 dataset, PR-filter showed outstanding performance in SSIM
during blind denoising tasks. It also significantly improved the performance of
state-of-the-art convolutional neural network blind denosing on non-Gaussian
noise. The performance of keeping more details might be attributed to small
receptive field of the photoreceptors.
