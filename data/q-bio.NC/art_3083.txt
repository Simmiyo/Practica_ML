Multi-feature classifiers for burst detection in single EEG channels
  from preterm infants
The study of electroencephalographic (EEG) bursts in preterm infants provides
valuable information about maturation or prognostication after perinatal
asphyxia. Over the last two decades, a number of works proposed algorithms to
automatically detect EEG bursts in preterm infants, but they were designed for
populations under 35 weeks of post menstrual age (PMA). However, as the brain
activity evolves rapidly during postnatal life, these solutions might be
under-performing with increasing PMA. In this work we focused on preterm
infants reaching term ages (PMA $\geq$ 36 weeks) using multi-feature
classification on a single EEG channel. Five EEG burst detectors relying on
different machine learning approaches were compared: Logistic regression (LR),
linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), support vector
machines (SVM) and thresholding (Th). Classifiers were trained by visually
labeled EEG recordings from 14 very preterm infants (born after 28 weeks of
gestation) with 36 - 41 weeks PMA. The most performing classifiers reached
about 95\% accuracy (kNN, SVM and LR) whereas Th obtained 84\%. Compared to
human-automatic agreements, LR provided the highest scores (Cohen's kappa =
0.71) and the best computational efficiency using only three EEG features.
Applying this classifier in a test database of 21 infants $\geq$ 36 weeks PMA,
we show that long EEG bursts and short inter-bust periods are characteristic of
infants with the highest PMA and weights. In view of these results, LR-based
burst detection could be a suitable tool to study maturation in monitoring or
portable devices using a single EEG channel.
