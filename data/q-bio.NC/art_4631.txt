Towards the Self-constructive Brain: emergence of adaptive behavior
Adaptive behavior is mainly the result of adaptive brains. We go a step
beyond and claim that the brain does not only adapt to its surrounding reality
but rather, it builds itself up to constructs its own reality. That is, rather
than just trying to passively understand its environment, the brain is the
architect of its own reality in an active process where its internal models of
the external world frame how its new interactions with the environment are
assimilated. These internal models represent relevant predictive patterns of
interaction all over the different brain structures: perceptual, sensorimotor,
motor, etc. The emergence of adaptive behavior arises from this
self-constructive nature of the brain, based on the following principles of
organization: self-experimental, self- growing, and self-repairing.
Self-experimental, since to ensure survival, the self-constructive brain (SCB)
is an active machine capable of performing experiments of its own interactions
with the environment by mental simulation. Self-growing, since it dynamically
and incrementally constructs internal structures in order to build a model of
the world as it gathers statistics from its interactions with the environment.
Self-repairing, since to survive the SCB must also be robust and capable of
finding ways to repair parts of previously working structures and hence
re-construct a previous relevant pattern of activity.
