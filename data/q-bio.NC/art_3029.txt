Examining Representational Similarity in ConvNets and the Primate Visual
  Cortex
We compare several ConvNets with different depth and regularization
techniques with multi-unit macaque IT cortex recordings and assess the impact
of the same on representational similarity with the primate visual cortex. We
find that with increasing depth and validation performance, ConvNet features
are closer to cortical IT representations.
