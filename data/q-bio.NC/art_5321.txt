Expectation Learning for Adaptive Crossmodal Stimuli Association
The human brain is able to learn, generalize, and predict crossmodal stimuli.
Learning by expectation fine-tunes crossmodal processing at different levels,
thus enhancing our power of generalization and adaptation in highly dynamic
environments. In this paper, we propose a deep neural architecture trained by
using expectation learning accounting for unsupervised learning tasks. Our
learning model exhibits a self-adaptable behavior, setting the first steps
towards the development of deep learning architectures for crossmodal stimuli
association.
