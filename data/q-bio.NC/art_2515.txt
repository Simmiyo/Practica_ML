Pattern-wave model of brain. Mechanisms of information processing,
  memory organization
The structure of the axon-dendrite connections of neurons of the brain
creates a rich spatial structure in which provided various combinations of
signals surrounding neurons. Structure of dendritic trees and shape of
dendritic spines allow repeatedly increase combinatorial component through
cross synapses influence neighboring neurons. In this paper it is shown that
the diffuse spreading of neurotransmitters allows neurons to detect and
remember significant set of environmental activity patterns. As a core element
fixation described extrasynaptic metabotropic receptive clusters. The described
mechanism leads to the appearance of wave processes, based on the propagation
of the front-line areas of spontaneous activity. In the proposed model, any
compact pattern of neural activity is seen as a source emitting a diverging
wave endogenous spikes. It is shown that the spike pattern of the wave front is
strictly unique and uniquely defined pattern that started the wave. The
propagation of waves with a unique pattern allows anywhere in nature undergoing
brain wave patterns there to judge the whole brain processes information. In
these assumptions naturally described mechanism of projection information
between regions of the cortex. Performed computer simulations show the high
effectiveness of such information model.
