On the Dynamical Complexity of Small-World Networks of Spiking Neurons
A computer model is described which is used to assess the dynamical
complexity of a class of networks of spiking neurons with small-world
properties. Networks are constructed by forming an initially segregated set of
highly intra-connected clusters and then applying a probabilistic rewiring
method reminiscent of the Watts-Strogatz procedure to make inter-cluster
connections. Causal density, which counts the number of independent significant
interactions among a system's components, is used to assess dynamical
complexity. This measure was chosen because it employs lagged observations, and
is therefore more sensitive to temporally smeared evidence of segregation and
integration than its alternatives. The results broadly support the hypothesis
that small-world topology promotes dynamical complexity, but reveal a narrow
parameter range within which this occurs for the network topology under
investigation, and suggest an inverse correlation with phase synchrony inside
this range.
