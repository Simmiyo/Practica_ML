Dual-task Coordination in Children and Adolescents with Attention
  Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
The deficit of executive functioning was found to be associated with
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in general and its subtypes.
One of the important functions of central executive is the ability
simultaneously coordinate two tasks. The study aimed at defining the dual-task
performance characteristics in healthy children and adolescents on the
computerised and the paper and pencil dual-task methods; investigating the
effect of task difficulty on dual-task performance in ADHD in comparison to age
and years of education matched healthy controls; testing if the paper and
pencil version of the dual-task method is giving the same results in ADHD and
healthy controls; investigating whether the dual-task functioning in ADHD is
defined by the deficits in the general motor functioning and comorbidity
factors. The study investigated dual task functioning in 6-16 years old 91
typically developing controls and 91 children with ADHD. It was found that: (1)
the dual-task coordination is available in children and adolescents with ADHD
in general and in its subtypes and not significantly different from performance
of age and years of education matched healthy controls; (2) Increase of the
task difficulty in dual-task paradigm don't affect disproportionately children
and adolescents with ADHD in comparison to age and years of education matched
healthy controls; (3) The paper and pencil version of the dual-task method is
giving the same results in ADHD and healthy controls as computerised version;
(4) The dual-task functioning in ADHD in general and in its subtypes is not
defined by the general motor functioning while in healthy controls dual task
performance is associated with the general motor functioning level; (5) The
dual-task functioning in ADHD in general and in its subtypes is not defined by
the comorbidity factors.
