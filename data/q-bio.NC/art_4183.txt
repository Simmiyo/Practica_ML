A Study on Stroke Rehabilitation through Task-Oriented Control of a
  Haptic Device via Near-Infrared Spectroscopy-Based BCI
This paper presents a study in task-oriented approach to stroke
rehabilitation by controlling a haptic device via near-infrared
spectroscopy-based brain-computer interface (BCI). The task is to command the
haptic device to move in opposing directions of leftward and rightward
movement. Our study consists of data acquisition, signal preprocessing, and
classification. In data acquisition, we conduct experiments based on two
different mental tasks: one on pure motor imagery, and another on combined
motor imagery and action observation. The experiments were conducted in both
offline and online modes. In the signal preprocessing, we use localization
method to eliminate channels that are irrelevant to the mental task, as well as
perform feature extraction for subsequent classification. We propose multiple
support vector machine classifiers with a majority-voting scheme for improved
classification results. And lastly, we present test results to demonstrate the
efficacy of our proposed approach to possible stroke rehabilitation practice.
