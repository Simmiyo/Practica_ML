A Mathematical Formalization of Hierarchical Temporal Memory's Spatial
  Pooler
Hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) is an emerging machine learning algorithm,
with the potential to provide a means to perform predictions on spatiotemporal
data. The algorithm, inspired by the neocortex, currently does not have a
comprehensive mathematical framework. This work brings together all aspects of
the spatial pooler (SP), a critical learning component in HTM, under a single
unifying framework. The primary learning mechanism is explored, where a maximum
likelihood estimator for determining the degree of permanence update is
proposed. The boosting mechanisms are studied and found to be only relevant
during the initial few iterations of the network. Observations are made
relating HTM to well-known algorithms such as competitive learning and
attribute bagging. Methods are provided for using the SP for classification as
well as dimensionality reduction. Empirical evidence verifies that given the
proper parameterizations, the SP may be used for feature learning.
