EEG Signal Processing and Classification for the Novel Tactile-Force
  Brain-Computer Interface Paradigm
The presented study explores the extent to which tactile-force stimulus
delivered to a hand holding a joystick can serve as a platform for a brain
computer interface (BCI). The four pressure directions are used to evoke
tactile brain potential responses, thus defining a tactile-force brain computer
interface (tfBCI). We present brain signal processing and classification
procedures leading to successful interfacing results. Experimental results with
seven subjects performing online BCI experiments provide a validation of the
hand location tfBCI paradigm, while the feasibility of the concept is
illuminated through remarkable information-transfer rates.
