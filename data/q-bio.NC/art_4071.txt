Complex synchronous behavior in interneuronal networks with delayed
  inhibitory and fast electrical synapses
Networks of fast-spiking interneurons are crucial for the generation of
neural oscillations in the brain. Here we study the synchronous behavior of
interneuronal networks that are coupled by delayed inhibitory and fast
electrical synapses. We find that both coupling modes play a crucial role by
the synchronization of the network. In addition, delayed inhibitory synapses
affect the emerging oscillatory patterns. By increasing the inhibitory synaptic
delay, we observe a transition from regular to mixed oscillatory patterns at a
critical value. We also examine how the unreliability of inhibitory synapses
influences the emergence of synchronization and the oscillatory patterns. We
find that low levels of reliability tend to destroy synchronization, and
moreover, that interneuronal networks with long inhibitory synaptic delays
require a minimal level of reliability for the mixed oscillatory pattern to be
maintained.
