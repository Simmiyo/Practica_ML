Towards the bio-personalization of music recommendation systems: A
  single-sensor EEG biomarker of subjective music preference
Recent advances in biosensors technology and mobile electroencephalographic
(EEG) interfaces have opened new application fields for cognitive monitoring. A
computable biomarker for the assessment of spontaneous aesthetic brain
responses during music listening is introduced here. It derives from
well-established measures of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) and quantifies the
music-induced alterations in the dynamic relationships between brain rhythms.
During a stage of exploratory analysis, and using the signals from a suitably
designed experiment, we established the biomarker, which acts on brain
activations recorded over the left prefrontal cortex and focuses on the
functional coupling between high-beta and low-gamma oscillations. Based on data
from an additional experimental paradigm, we validated the introduced biomarker
and showed its relevance for expressing the subjective aesthetic appreciation
of a piece of music. Our approach resulted in an affordable tool that can
promote human-machine interaction and, by serving as a personalized music
annotation strategy, can be potentially integrated into modern flexible music
recommendation systems.
