Output Stream of Binding Neuron with Feedback
The binding neuron model is inspired by numerical simulation of
Hodgkin-Huxley-type point neuron, as well as by the leaky integrate-and-fire
model. In the binding neuron, the trace of an input is remembered for a fixed
period of time after which it disappears completely. This is in the contrast
with the above two models, where the postsynaptic potentials decay
exponentially and can be forgotten only after triggering. The finiteness of
memory in the binding neuron allows one to construct fast recurrent networks
for computer modeling. Recently, the finiteness is utilized for exact
mathematical description of the output stochastic process if the binding neuron
is driven with the Poissonian input stream. In this paper, the simplest
networking is considered for binding neuron. Namely, it is expected that every
output spike of single neuron is immediately fed into its input. For this
construction, externally fed with Poissonian stream, the output stream is
characterized in terms of interspike interval probability density distribution
if the binding neuron has threshold 2. For higher thresholds, the distribution
is calculated numerically. The distributions are compared with those found for
binding neuron without feedback, and for leaky integrator. Sample distributions
for leaky integrator with feedback are calculated numerically as well. It is
oncluded that even the simplest networking can radically alter spikng
statistics. Information condensation at the level of single neuron is
discussed.
