Computer Model of a "Sense of Humour". I. General Algorithm
A computer model of a "sense of humour" is proposed. The humorous effect is
interpreted as a specific malfunction in the course of information processing
due to the need for the rapid deletion of the false version transmitted into
consciousness. The biological function of a sense of humour consists in
speeding up the bringing of information into consciousness and in fuller use of
the resources of the brain.
