Technical aspects of an impact acceleration traumatic brain injury rat
  model with potential suitability for both microdialysis and PtiO2 monitoring
This report describes technical adaptations of a traumatic brain injury (TBI)
model-largely inspired by Marmarou-in order to monitor microdialysis data and
PtiO2 (brain tissue oxygen) before, during and after injury. We particularly
focalize on our model requirements which allows us to re-create some drastic
pathological characteristics experienced by severely head-injured patients:
impact on a closed skull, no ventilation immediately after impact, presence of
diffuse axonal injuries and secondary brain insults from systemic origin...We
notably give priority to minimize anaesthesia duration in order to tend to
banish any neuroprotection. Our new model will henceforth allow a better
understanding of neurochemical and biochemical alterations resulting from
traumatic brain injury, using microdialysis and PtiO2 techniques already
monitored in our Intensive Care Unit. Studies on efficiency and therapeutic
window of neuroprotective pharmacological molecules are now conceivable to
ameliorate severe head-injury treatment.
