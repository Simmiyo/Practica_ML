Vibrotactile Stimulus Frequency Optimization for the Haptic BCI
  Prototype
The paper presents results from a psychophysical study conducted to optimize
vibrotactile stimuli delivered to subject finger tips in order to evoke the
somatosensory responses to be utilized next in a haptic brain computer
interface (hBCI) paradigm. We also present the preliminary EEG evoked responses
for the chosen stimulating frequency. The obtained results confirm our
hypothesis that the hBCI paradigm concept is valid and it will allow for rapid
stimuli presentation in order to improve information-transfer-rate (ITR) of the
BCI.
