Rhythmogenic neuronal networks, pacemakers, and k-cores
Neuronal networks are controlled by a combination of the dynamics of
individual neurons and the connectivity of the network that links them
together. We study a minimal model of the preBotzinger complex, a small
neuronal network that controls the breathing rhythm of mammals through periodic
firing bursts. We show that the properties of a such a randomly connected
network of identical excitatory neurons are fundamentally different from those
of uniformly connected neuronal networks as described by mean-field theory. We
show that (i) the connectivity properties of the networks determines the
location of emergent pacemakers that trigger the firing bursts and (ii) that
the collective desensitization that terminates the firing bursts is determined
again by the network connectivity, through k-core clusters of neurons.
