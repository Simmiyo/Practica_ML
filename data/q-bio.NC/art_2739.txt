Quadripolar Relational Model: a framework for the description of
  borderline and narcissistic personality disorders
Borderline personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder are
important nosographic entities and have been subject of intensive
investigations. The currently prevailing psychodynamic theory for mental
disorders is based on the repertoire of defense mechanisms employed. Another
line of research is concerned with the study of psychological traumas and
dissociation as a defensive response. Both theories can be used to shed light
on some aspects of pathological mental functioning, and have many points of
contact. This work merges these two psychological theories, and builds a model
of mental function in a relational context called Quadripolar Relational Model.
The model, which is enriched with ideas borrowed from the field of computer
science, leads to a new therapeutic proposal for psychological traumas and
personality disorders.
