Fast dynamics of odor rate coding in the insect antennal lobe
Insects identify and evaluate behaviorally relevant odorants in complex
natural scenes where odor concentrations and mixture composition can change
rapidly. In the honeybee, a combinatorial code of activated and inactivated
projection neurons (PNs) develops rapidly within tens of milliseconds at the
first level of neural integration, the antennal lobe (AL). The phasic-tonic
stimulus-response dynamics observed in the neural population code and in the
firing rate profiles of single neurons is faithfully captured by two
alternative models which rely either on short-term synaptic depression, or on
spike frequency adaptation. Both mechanisms work independently and possibly in
parallel to lateral inhibition. Short response latencies in local interneurons
indicate that local processing within the AL network relies on fast lateral
inhibition that can suppress effectively and specifically odor responses in
single PNs. Reviewing recent findings obtained in different insect species, we
conclude that the insect olfactory system implements a fast and reliable coding
scheme optimized for time-varying input within the behaviorally relevant
dynamic range.
