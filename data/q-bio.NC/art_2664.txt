Inter-stimulus Interval Study for the Tactile Point-pressure
  Brain-computer Interface
The paper presents a study of an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) influence on a
tactile point-pressure stimulus-based brain-computer interface's (tpBCI)
classification accuracy. A novel tactile pressure generating tpBCI stimulator
is also discussed, which is based on a three-by-three pins' matrix prototype.
The six pin-linear patterns are presented to the user's palm during the online
tpBCI experiments in an oddball style paradigm allowing for "the aha-responses"
elucidation, within the event related potential (ERP). A subsequent
classification accuracies' comparison is discussed based on two ISI settings in
an online tpBCI application. A research hypothesis of classification
accuracies' non-significant differences with various ISIs is confirmed based on
the two settings of 120 ms and 300 ms, as well as with various numbers of ERP
response averaging scenarios.
