Will Break for Productivity: Generalized Symptoms of Cognitive Depletion
In this work, we address the symptoms of cognitive depletion as they relate
to generalized knowledge workers. We unify previous findings within a single
analytical model of cognitive depletion. Our purpose is to develop a model that
will help us predict when a person has reached a sufficient state of cognitive
depletion such that taking a break or some other restorative action will
benefit both his or her own wellbeing and the quality of his or her
performance. We provide a definition of each symptom in our model as well as
the effect it would have on a knowledge worker's ability to work productively.
We discuss methods to detect each symptom that do not require self assessment.
Understanding symptoms of cognitive depletion provides the ability to support
human knowledge workers by reducing the stress involved with cognitive and work
overload while maintaining or improving the quality of their performance.
