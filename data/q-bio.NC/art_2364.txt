Synthesis of neural networks for spatio-temporal spike pattern
  recognition and processing
The advent of large scale neural computational platforms has highlighted the
lack of algorithms for synthesis of neural structures to perform predefined
cognitive tasks. The Neural Engineering Framework offers one such synthesis,
but it is most effective for a spike rate representation of neural information,
and it requires a large number of neurons to implement simple functions. We
describe a neural network synthesis method that generates synaptic connectivity
for neurons which process time-encoded neural signals, and which makes very
sparse use of neurons. The method allows the user to specify, arbitrarily,
neuronal characteristics such as axonal and dendritic delays, and synaptic
transfer functions, and then solves for the optimal input-output relationship
using computed dendritic weights. The method may be used for batch or online
learning and has an extremely fast optimization process. We demonstrate its use
in generating a network to recognize speech which is sparsely encoded as spike
times.
