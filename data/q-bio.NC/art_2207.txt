Perception of Motion and Architectural Form: Computational Relationships
  between Optical Flow and Perspective
Perceptual geometry refers to the interdisciplinary research whose objectives
focuses on study of geometry from the perspective of visual perception, and in
turn, applies such geometric findings to the ecological study of vision.
Perceptual geometry attempts to answer fundamental questions in perception of
form and representation of space through synthesis of cognitive and biological
theories of visual perception with geometric theories of the physical world.
Perception of form, space and motion are among fundamental problems in vision
science. In cognitive and computational models of human perception, the
theories for modeling motion are treated separately from models for perception
of form.
