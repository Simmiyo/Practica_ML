Physiologically motivated multiplex Kuramoto model describes phase
  diagram of cortical activity
We derive a two-layer multiplex Kuramoto model from weakly coupled
Wilson-Cowan oscillators on a cortical network with inhibitory synaptic time
delays. Depending on the coupling strength and a phase shift parameter, related
to cerebral blood flow and GABA concentration, respectively, we numerically
identify three macroscopic phases: unsynchronized, synchronized, and chaotic
dynamics. These correspond to physiological background-, epileptic seizure-,
and resting-state cortical activity, respectively. We also observe frequency
suppression at the transition from resting-state to seizure activity.
