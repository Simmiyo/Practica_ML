Stimulus - response curves of a neuronal model for noisy subthreshold
  oscillations and related spike generation
We investigate the stimulus-dependent tuning properties of a noisy ionic
conductance model for intrinsic subthreshold oscillations in membrane potential
and associated spike generation. On depolarization by an applied current, the
model exhibits subthreshold oscillatory activity with occasional spike
generation when oscillations reach the spike threshold. We consider how the
amount of applied current, the noise intensity, variation of maximum
conductance values and scaling to different temperature ranges alter the
responses of the model with respect to voltage traces, interspike intervals and
their statistics and the mean spike frequency curves. We demonstrate that
subthreshold oscillatory neurons in the presence of noise can sensitively and
also selectively be tuned by stimulus-dependent variation of model parameters.
