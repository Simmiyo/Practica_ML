A neural circuit for navigation inspired by C. elegans Chemotaxis
We develop an artificial neural circuit for contour tracking and navigation
inspired by the chemotaxis of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. In order to
harness the computational advantages spiking neural networks promise over their
non-spiking counterparts, we develop a network comprising 7-spiking neurons
with non-plastic synapses which we show is extremely robust in tracking a range
of concentrations. Our worm uses information regarding local temporal gradients
in sodium chloride concentration to decide the instantaneous path for foraging,
exploration and tracking. A key neuron pair in the C. elegans chemotaxis
network is the ASEL & ASER neuron pair, which capture the gradient of
concentration sensed by the worm in their graded membrane potentials. The
primary sensory neurons for our network are a pair of artificial spiking
neurons that function as gradient detectors whose design is adapted from a
computational model of the ASE neuron pair in C. elegans. Simulations show that
our worm is able to detect the set-point with approximately four times higher
probability than the optimal memoryless Levy foraging model. We also show that
our spiking neural network is much more efficient and noise-resilient while
navigating and tracking a contour, as compared to an equivalent non-spiking
network. We demonstrate that our model is extremely robust to noise and with
slight modifications can be used for other practical applications such as
obstacle avoidance. Our network model could also be extended for use in
three-dimensional contour tracking or obstacle avoidance.
