Tensor Decompositions: A New Concept in Brain Data Analysis?
Matrix factorizations and their extensions to tensor factorizations and
decompositions have become prominent techniques for linear and multilinear
blind source separation (BSS), especially multiway Independent Component
Analysis (ICA), NonnegativeMatrix and Tensor Factorization (NMF/NTF), Smooth
Component Analysis (SmoCA) and Sparse Component Analysis (SCA). Moreover,
tensor decompositions have many other potential applications beyond multilinear
BSS, especially feature extraction, classification, dimensionality reduction
and multiway clustering. In this paper, we briefly overview new and emerging
models and approaches for tensor decompositions in applications to group and
linked multiway BSS/ICA, feature extraction, classification andMultiway Partial
Least Squares (MPLS) regression problems. Keywords: Multilinear BSS, linked
multiway BSS/ICA, tensor factorizations and decompositions, constrained Tucker
and CP models, Penalized Tensor Decompositions (PTD), feature extraction,
classification, multiway PLS and CCA.
