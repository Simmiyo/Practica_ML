Open-source tools for dynamical analysis of Liley's mean-field cortex
  model
Mean-field models of the mammalian cortex treat this part of the brain as a
two-dimensional excitable medium. The electrical potentials, generated by the
excitatory and inhibitory neuron populations, are described by nonlinear,
coupled, partial differential equations, that are known to generate complicated
spatio-temporal behaviour. We focus on the model by Liley {\sl et al.}
(Network: Comput. Neural Syst. (2002) 13, 67-113). Several reductions of this
model have been studied in detail, but a direct analysis of its spatio-temporal
dynamics has, to the best of our knowledge, never been attempted before. Here,
we describe the implementation of implicit time-stepping of the model and the
tangent linear model, and solving for equilibria and time-periodic solutions,
using the open-source library PETSc. By using domain decomposition for
parallelization, and iterative solving of linear problems, the code is capable
of parsing some dynamics of a macroscopic slice of cortical tissue with a
sub-millimetre resolution.
