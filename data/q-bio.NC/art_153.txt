Type I and type II neuron models are selectively driven by differential
  stimulus features
Neurons in the nervous system exhibit an outstanding variety of morphological
and physiological properties. However, close to threshold, this remarkable
richness may be grouped succinctly into two basic types of excitability, often
referred to as type I and type II. The dynamical traits of these two neuron
types have been extensively characterized. It would be interesting, however, to
understand the information-processing consequences of their dynamical
properties. To that end, here we determine the differences between the stimulus
features inducing firing in type I and in type II neurons. We work both with
realistic conductance-based models and minimal normal forms. We conclude that
type I neurons fire in response to scale-free depolarizing stimuli. Type II
neurons, instead, are most efficiently driven by input stimuli containing both
depolarizing and hyperpolarizing phases, with significant power in the
frequency band corresponding to the intrinsic frequencies of the cell.
