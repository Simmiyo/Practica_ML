Memorization in a neural network with adjustable transfer function and
  conditional gating
The main problem about replacing LTP as a memory mechanism has been to find
other highly abstract, easily understandable principles for induced plasticity.
In this paper we attempt to lay out such a basic mechanism, namely intrinsic
plasticity. Important empirical observations with theoretical significance are
time-layering of neural plasticity mediated by additional constraints to enter
into later stages, various manifestations of intrinsic neural properties, and
conditional gating of synaptic connections. An important consequence of the
proposed mechanism is that it can explain the usually latent nature of
memories.
