RhoanaNet Pipeline: Dense Automatic Neural Annotation
Reconstructing a synaptic wiring diagram, or connectome, from electron
microscopy (EM) images of brain tissue currently requires many hours of manual
annotation or proofreading (Kasthuri and Lichtman, 2010; Lichtman and Sanes,
2008; Seung, 2009). The desire to reconstruct ever larger and more complex
networks has pushed the collection of ever larger EM datasets. A cubic
millimeter of raw imaging data would take up 1 PB of storage and present an
annotation project that would be impractical without relying heavily on
automatic segmentation methods. The RhoanaNet image processing pipeline was
developed to automatically segment large volumes of EM data and ease the burden
of manual proofreading and annotation. Based on (Kaynig et al., 2015), we
updated every stage of the software pipeline to provide better throughput
performance and higher quality segmentation results. We used state of the art
deep learning techniques to generate improved membrane probability maps, and
Gala (Nunez-Iglesias et al., 2014) was used to agglomerate 2D segments into 3D
objects.
  We applied the RhoanaNet pipeline to four densely annotated EM datasets, two
from mouse cortex, one from cerebellum and one from mouse lateral geniculate
nucleus (LGN). All training and test data is made available for benchmark
comparisons. The best segmentation results obtained gave
$V^\text{Info}_\text{F-score}$ scores of 0.9054 and 09182 for the cortex
datasets, 0.9438 for LGN, and 0.9150 for Cerebellum.
  The RhoanaNet pipeline is open source software. All source code, training
data, test data, and annotations for all four benchmark datasets are available
at www.rhoana.org.
