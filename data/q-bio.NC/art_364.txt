Modeling of interstitial branching of axonal networks
A single axon can generate branches connecting with plenty synaptic targets.
Process of branching is very important for making connections in central
nervous system. The interstitial branching along primary axon shaft occurs
during nervous system development. Growing axon makes pause in its movement and
leaves active points behind its terminal. The new branches appear from these
points. We suggest mathematical model to describe and investigate neural
network branching process. The model under consideration describes neural
network growth in which the concentration of axon guidance molecules manages
axon's growth. We model the interstitial branching from axon shaft. Numerical
simulations show that in the model framework axonal networks are similar to
neural network.
