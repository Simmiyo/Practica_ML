Neural Reconstruction Integrity: A metric for assessing the connectivity
  of reconstructed neural networks
Neuroscientists are actively pursuing high-precision maps, or graphs,
consisting of networks of neurons and connecting synapses in mammalian and
non-mammalian brains. Such graphs, when coupled with physiological and
behavioral data, are likely to facilitate greater understanding of how circuits
in these networks give rise to complex information processing capabilities.
Given that the automated or semi-automated methods required to achieve the
acquisition of these graphs are still evolving, we develop a metric for
measuring the performance of such methods by comparing their output with those
generated by human annotators ("ground truth" data). Whereas classic metrics
for comparing annotated neural tissue reconstructions generally do so at the
voxel level, the metric proposed here measures the "integrity" of neurons based
on the degree to which a collection of synaptic terminals belonging to a single
neuron of the reconstruction can be matched to those of a single neuron in the
ground truth data. The metric is largely insensitive to small errors in
segmentation and more directly measures accuracy of the generated brain graph.
It is our hope that use of the metric will facilitate the broader community's
efforts to improve upon existing methods for acquiring brain graphs. Herein we
describe the metric in detail, provide demonstrative examples of the intuitive
scores it generates, and apply it to a synthesized neural network with
simulated reconstruction errors.
