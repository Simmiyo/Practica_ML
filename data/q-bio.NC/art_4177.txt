Memcapacitive neural networks
We show that memcapacitive (memory capacitive) systems can be used as
synapses in artificial neural networks. As an example of our approach, we
discuss the architecture of an integrate-and-fire neural network based on
memcapacitive synapses. Moreover, we demonstrate that the
spike-timing-dependent plasticity can be simply realized with some of these
devices. Memcapacitive synapses are a low-energy alternative to memristive
synapses for neuromorphic computation.
