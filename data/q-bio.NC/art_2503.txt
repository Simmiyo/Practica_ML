Airborne Ultrasonic Tactile Display Brain-computer Interface Paradigm
We study the extent to which contact-less and airborne ultrasonic tactile
display (AUTD) stimuli delivered to the palms of a user can serve as a platform
for a brain computer interface (BCI) paradigm. Six palm positions are used to
evoke combined somatosensory brain responses, in order to define a novel
contact-less tactile BCI. A comparison is made with classical attached
vibrotactile transducers. Experiment results of subjects performing online
experiments validate the novel BCI paradigm.
