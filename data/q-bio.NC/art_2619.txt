Effects of the spike timing-dependent plasticity on the synchronisation
  in a random Hodgkin-Huxley neuronal network
In this paper, we study the effects of spike timing-dependent plasticity on
synchronisation in a network of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons. Neuron plasticity is a
flexible property of a neuron and its network to change temporarily or
permanently their biochemical, physiological, and morphological
characteristics, in order to adapt to the environment. Regarding the
plasticity, we consider Hebbian rules, specifically for spike timing-dependent
plasticity (STDP), and with regard to network, we consider that the connections
are randomly distributed. We analyse the synchronisation and desynchronisation
according to an input level and probability of connections. Moreover, we verify
that the transition for synchronisation depends on the neuronal network
architecture, and the external perturbation level.
