Ghosts of bump attractors in stochastic neural fields: Bottlenecks and
  extinction
We study the effects of additive noise on stationary bump solutions to
spatially extended neural fields near a saddle-node bifurcation. The integral
terms of these evolution equations have a weight kernel describing synaptic
interactions between neurons at different locations of the network. Excited
regions of the neural field correspond to parts of the domain whose fraction of
active neurons exceeds a sharp threshold of a firing rate nonlinearity. For
sufficiently low firing threshold, a stable bump coexists with an unstable bump
and a homogeneous quiescent state. As the threshold is increased, the stable
and unstable branch of bump solutions annihilate in a saddle node bifurcation.
Near this criticality, we derive a quadratic amplitude equation that describes
the slow evolution of the even mode (bump contractions) as it depends on the
distance from the bifurcation. Beyond the bifurcation, bumps eventually become
extinct, and the time it takes for this to occur increases for systems nearer
the bifurcation. When noise is incorporated, a stochastic amplitude equation
for the even mode can be derived, which can be analyzed to reveal bump
extinction time both below and above the saddle-node.
