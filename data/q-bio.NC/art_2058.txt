Can power-law scaling and neuronal avalanches arise from stochastic
  dynamics?
The presence of self-organized criticality in biology is often evidenced by a
power-law scaling of event size distributions, which can be measured by linear
regression on logarithmic axes. We show here that such a procedure does not
necessarily mean that the system exhibits self-organized criticality. We first
provide an analysis of multisite local field potential (LFP) recordings of
brain activity and show that event size distributions defined as negative LFP
peaks can be close to power-law distributions. However, this result is not
robust to change in detection threshold, or when tested using more rigorous
statistical analyses such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Similar power-law
scaling is observed for surrogate signals, suggesting that power-law scaling
may be a generic property of thresholded stochastic processes. We next
investigate this problem analytically, and show that, indeed, stochastic
processes can produce spurious power-law scaling without the presence of
underlying self-organized criticality. However, this power-law is only apparent
in logarithmic representations, and does not survive more rigorous analysis
such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The same analysis was also performed on an
artificial network known to display self-organized criticality. In this case,
both the graphical representations and the rigorous statistical analysis reveal
with no ambiguity that the avalanche size is distributed as a power-law. We
conclude that logarithmic representations can lead to spurious power-law
scaling induced by the stochastic nature of the phenomenon. This apparent
power-law scaling does not constitute a proof of self-organized criticality,
which should be demonstrated by more stringent statistical tests.
