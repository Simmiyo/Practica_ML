Neural tuning size is a key factor underlying holistic face processing
Faces are a class of visual stimuli with unique significance, for a variety
of reasons. They are ubiquitous throughout the course of a person's life, and
face recognition is crucial for daily social interaction. Faces are also unlike
any other stimulus class in terms of certain physical stimulus characteristics.
Furthermore, faces have been empirically found to elicit certain characteristic
behavioral phenomena, which are widely held to be evidence of "holistic"
processing of faces. However, little is known about the neural mechanisms
underlying such holistic face processing. In other words, for the processing of
faces by the primate visual system, the input and output characteristics are
relatively well known, but the internal neural computations are not. The main
aim of this work is to further the fundamental understanding of what causes the
visual processing of faces to be different from that of objects. In this
computational modeling work, we show that a single factor - "neural tuning
size" - is able to account for three key phenomena that are characteristic of
face processing, namely the Composite Face Effect (CFE), Face Inversion Effect
(FIE) and Whole-Part Effect (WPE). Our computational proof-of-principle
provides specific neural tuning properties that correspond to the
poorly-understood notion of holistic face processing, and connects these neural
properties to psychophysical behavior. Overall, our work provides a unified and
parsimonious theoretical account for the disparate empirical data on
face-specific processing, deepening the fundamental understanding of face
processing.
