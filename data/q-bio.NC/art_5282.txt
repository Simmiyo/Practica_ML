Information processing occurs via critical avalanches in a model of the
  primary visual cortex
We study a new biologically motivated model for the Macaque monkey primary
visual cortex which presents power-law avalanches after a visual stimulus. The
signal propagates through all the layers of the model via avalanches that
depend on network structure and synaptic parameter. We identify four different
avalanche profiles as a function of the excitatory postsynaptic potential. The
avalanches follow a size-duration scaling relation and present critical
exponents that match experiments. The structure of the network gives rise to a
regime of two characteristic spatial scales, one of which vanishes in the
thermodynamic limit.
