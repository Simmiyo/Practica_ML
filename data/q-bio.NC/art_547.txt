The cerebellum could solve the motor error problem through error
  increase prediction
We present a cerebellar architecture with two main characteristics. The first
one is that complex spikes respond to increases in sensory errors. The second
one is that cerebellar modules associate particular contexts where errors have
increased in the past with corrective commands that stop the increase in error.
We analyze our architecture formally and computationally for the case of
reaching in a 3D environment. In the case of motor control, we show that there
are synergies of this architecture with the Equilibrium-Point hypothesis,
leading to novel ways to solve the motor error problem. In particular, the
presence of desired equilibrium lengths for muscles provides a way to know when
the error is increasing, and which corrections to apply. In the context of
Threshold Control Theory and Perceptual Control Theory we show how to extend
our model so it implements anticipative corrections in cascade control systems
that span from muscle contractions to cognitive operations.
