Response of Selective Attention in Middle Temporal Area
The primary visual cortex processes a large amount of visual information,
however, due to its large receptive fields, when multiple stimuli fall within
one receptive field, there are computational problems. To solve this problem,
the visual system uses selective attention, which allocates resources to a
specific spatial location, to attend to one of the stimuli in the receptive
field. During this process, the center and width of the attending receptive
field change. The model presented in the paper, which is extended and altered
from Bobier et al., simulates the selective attention between the primary
visual cortex, V1, and middle temporal (MT) area. The responses of the MT
columns, which encode the target stimulus, are compared to the results of an
experiment conducted by Womelsdorf et al. on the receptive field shift and
shrinkage in macaque MT area from selective attention. Based on the results,
the responses in the MT area are similar to the Gaussian shaped receptive
fields found in the experiment. As well, the responses of the MT columns are
also measured for accuracy of representing the target visual stimulus and is
found to represent the stimulus with a root mean squared error around 0.17 to
0.18. The paper also explores varying model parameters, such as the membrane
time constant and maximum firing rates, and how those affect the measurement.
This model is a start to modeling the responses of selective attention, however
there are still improvements that can be made to better compare with the
experiment, produce more accurate responses and incorporate more biologically
plausible features.
