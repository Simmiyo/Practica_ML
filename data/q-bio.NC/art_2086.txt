Observed network dynamics from altering the balance between excitatory
  and inhibitory neurons in cultured networks
Complexity in the temporal organization of neural systems may be a reflection
of the diversity of its neural constituents. These constituents, excitatory and
inhibitory neurons, comprise an invariant ratio in vivo and form the substrate
for rhythmic oscillatory activity. To begin to elucidate the dynamical
mechanisms that underlie this balance, we construct novel neural circuits not
ordinarily found in nature. We culture several networks of neurons composed of
excitatory and inhibitory cells and use a multi-electrode array to study their
temporal dynamics as the balance is modulated. We use the electrode burst as
the temporal imprimatur to signify the presence of network activity. Burst
durations, inter-burst intervals, and the number of spikes participating within
a burst are used to illustrate the vivid dynamical differences between the
various cultured networks. When the network consists largely of excitatory
neurons, no network temporal structure is apparent. However, the addition of
inhibitory neurons evokes a temporal order. Calculation of the temporal
autocorrelation shows that when the number of inhibitory neurons is a major
fraction of the network, a striking network pattern materializes when none was
previously present.
