Contribution of the kinetics of G protein dissociation to the
  characteristic modifications of N-type calcium channel activity
Direct G protein inhibition of N-type calcium channels is recognized by
characteristic biophysical modifications. In this study, we quantify and
simulate the importance of G protein dissociation on the phenotype of G
protein-regulated whole-cell currents. Based on the observation that the
voltage-dependence of the time constant of recovery from G protein inhibition
is correlated with the voltage-dependence of channel opening, we depict all G
protein effects by a simple kinetic scheme. All landmark modifications in
calcium currents, except inhibition, can be successfully described using three
simple biophysical parameters (extent of block, extent of recovery, and time
constant of recovery). Modifications of these parameters by auxiliary beta
subunits are at the origin of differences in N-type channel regulation by G
proteins. The simulation data illustrate that channel reluctance can occur as
the result of an experimental bias linked to the variable extent of G protein
dissociation when peak currents are measured at various membrane potentials. To
produce alterations in channel kinetics, the two most important parameters are
the extents of initial block and recovery. These data emphasize the
contribution of the degree and kinetics of G protein dissociation in the
modification of N-type currents.
