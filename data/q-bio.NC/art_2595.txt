Neural codes and homotopy types: mathematical models of place field
  recognition
This note is a brief survey of some results of the recent collaboration of
neurobiologists and mathematicians dedicated to stimulus reconstruction from
neuronal spiking activity. This collaboration, in particular, led to the
consideration of binary codes used by brain for encoding a stimuli domain such
as a rodent's territory through the combinatorics of its covering by local
neighborhoods.
  The survey is addressed to mathematicians (cf. [DeSch01]) and focuses on the
idea that stimuli spaces are represented by the relevant neural codes as
simplicial sets and thus encode say, the homotopy type of space if local
neighborhoods are convex (see [CuIt08], [CuItVCYo13], [Yo14], [SiGh07]).}
