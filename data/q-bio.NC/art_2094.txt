Artificial Learning in Artificial Memories
Memory refinements are designed below to detect those sequences of actions
that have been repeated a given number n. Subsequently such sequences are
permitted to run without CPU involvement. This mimics human learning. Actions
are rehearsed and once learned, they are performed automatically without
conscious involvement.
