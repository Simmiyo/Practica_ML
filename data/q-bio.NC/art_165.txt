Muscle fatigue degrades force sense at the ankle joint
To investigate the effects of muscle fatigue on force sense at the ankle
joint, 10 young healthy adults were asked to perform an isometric
contra-lateral force ankle-matching task in two experimental conditions of: (1)
no-fatigue and (2) fatigue of the plantar-flexor muscles. Measures of the
overall accuracy and the variability of the force matching performances were
determined using the absolute error and the variable error, respectively.
Results showed less accurate and less consistent force matching performances in
the fatigue than no fatigue condition, as indicated by decreased absolute and
variable errors, respectively. The present findings evidence that muscle
fatigue degrades force sense at the ankle joint.
