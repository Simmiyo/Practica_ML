Cell-type-specific computational neuroanatomy, simulations from the
  sagittal and coronal Allen Brain Atlas
The Allen Atlas of the adult mouse brain is a brain-wide, genome-wide data
set that has been made available online, triggering a renaissance in
neuroanatomy. In particular, it has been used to define brain regions in a
computational, data-driven way, and to estimate the region-specificity of cell
types characterized independently by their transcriptional activity. However,
these results were based on one series of co-registered (coronal) ISH image
series per gene, whereas the online ABA contains several image series per
genes, including sagittal ones. Since the sagittal series cover mostly the left
hemisphere, we can simulate the variability of results by repeatedly drawing a
random image series for each gene and restricting the computation to the left
hemisphere. This gives rise to an estimate of error bars on the results of
computational neuroanatomy.
