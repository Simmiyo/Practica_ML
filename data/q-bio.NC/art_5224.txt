The dissipative quantum model of brain: how do memory localize in
  correlated neuronal domains
The mechanism of memory localization in extended domains is described in the
framework of the parametric dissipative quantum model of brain. The size of the
domains and the capability in memorizing depend on the number of links the
system is able to establish with the external world.
