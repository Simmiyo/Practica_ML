SeDMiD for Confusion Detection: Uncovering Mind State from Time Series
  Brain Wave Data
Understanding how brain functions has been an intriguing topic for years.
With the recent progress on collecting massive data and developing advanced
technology, people have become interested in addressing the challenge of
decoding brain wave data into meaningful mind states, with many machine
learning models and algorithms being revisited and developed, especially the
ones that handle time series data because of the nature of brain waves.
However, many of these time series models, like HMM with hidden state in
discrete space or State Space Model with hidden state in continuous space, only
work with one source of data and cannot handle different sources of information
simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an extension of State Space Model to
work with different sources of information together with its learning and
inference algorithms. We apply this model to decode the mind state of students
during lectures based on their brain waves and reach a significant better
results compared to traditional methods.
