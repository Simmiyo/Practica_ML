Non-Associative Learning Representation in the Nervous System of the
  Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans
Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) illustrated remarkable behavioral
plasticities including complex non-associative and associative learning
representations. Understanding the principles of such mechanisms presumably
leads to constructive inspirations for the design of efficient learning
algorithms. In the present study, we postulate a novel approach on modeling
single neurons and synapses to study the mechanisms underlying learning in the
C. elegans nervous system. In this regard, we construct a precise mathematical
model of sensory neurons where we include multi-scale details from genes, ion
channels and ion pumps, together with a dynamic model of synapses comprised of
neurotransmitters and receptors kinetics. We recapitulate mechanosensory
habituation mechanism, a non-associative learning process, in which elements of
the neural network tune their parameters as a result of repeated input stimuli.
Accordingly, we quantitatively demonstrate the roots of such plasticity in the
neuronal and synaptic-level representations. Our findings can potentially give
rise to the development of new bio-inspired learning algorithms.
