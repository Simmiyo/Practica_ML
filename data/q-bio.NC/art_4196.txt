Beyond the quantum formalism: consequences of a neural-oscillator model
  to quantum cognition
In this paper we present a neural oscillator model of stimulus response
theory that exhibits quantum-like behavior. We then show that without adding
any additional assumptions, a quantum model constructed to fit observable
pairwise correlations has no predictive power over the unknown triple moment,
obtainable through the activation of multiple oscillators. We compare this with
the results obtained in de Barros (2013), where a criteria of rationality gives
optimal ranges for the triple moment.
