Searching for memories, Sudoku, implicit check-bits, and the iterative
  use of not-always-correct rapid neural computation
The algorithms that simple feedback neural circuits representing a brain area
can rapidly carry out are often adequate to solve only easy problems, and for
more difficult problems can return incorrect answers. A new
excitatory-inhibitory circuit model of associative memory displays the common
human problem of failing to rapidly find a memory when only a small clue is
present. The memory model and a related computational network for solving
Sudoku puzzles produce answers that contain implicit check-bits in the
representation of information across neurons, allowing a rapid evaluation of
whether the putative answer is correct or incorrect through a computation
related to visual 'pop-out'. This fact may account for our strong psychological
feeling of right or wrong when we retrieve a nominal memory from a minimal
clue. This information allows more difficult computations or memory retrievals
to be done in a serial fashion by using the fast but limited capabilities of a
computational module multiple times. The mathematics of the
excitatory-inhibitory circuits for associative memory and for Sudoku, both of
which are understood in terms of 'energy' or Lyapunov functions, is described
in detail.
