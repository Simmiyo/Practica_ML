Animated 3D Human Models for Use in Person Recognition Experiments
The development of increasingly realistic experimental stimuli and task
environments is important for understanding behavior outside the laboratory. We
report a process for generating 3D human model stimuli that combines commonly
used graphics software and enables the flexible generation of animated human
models while providing parametric control over individualized identity
features. Our approach creates novel head models using FaceGen Modeller,
attaches them to commercially-purchased 3D avatar bodies in 3D Studio Max, and
generates Cal3D human models that are compatible with many virtual 3D
environments. Stimuli produced by this method can be embedded as animated 3D
avatars in interactive simulations or presented as 2D images embedded in scenes
for use in traditional laboratory experiments. The inherent flexibility in this
method makes the stimuli applicable to a broad range of basic and applied
research questions in the domain of person perception. We describe the steps of
the stimulus generation process, provide an example of their use in a
recognition memory paradigm, and highlight the adaptability of the method for
related avenues of research.
