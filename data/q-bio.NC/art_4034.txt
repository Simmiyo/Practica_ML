A Neuron Based Switch: Application to Low Power Mixed Signal Circuits
Human brain is functionally and physically complex. This 'complexity' can be
seen as a result of biological design process involving extensive use of
concepts such as modularity and hierarchy. Over the past decade, deeper
insights into the functioning of cortical neurons have led to the development
of models that can be implemented in hardware. The implementation of
biologically inspired spiking neuron networks in silicon can provide solutions
to difficult cognitive tasks. The work reported in this paper is an application
of a VLSI cortical neuron model for low power design. The VLSI implementation
shown in this paper is based on the spike and burst firing pattern of cortex
and follows the Izhikevich neuron model. This model is applied to a DC
differential amplifier as practical application of power reduction
