Curiosity and Pleasure
Heuristic decision making received wide attention due to the work of Tversky
and Kahneman (1981) and inspired multiple studies of irrationality of the human
mind and a fundamental disregard for knowledge. But what is the source of all
human knowledge, including heuristics? We discuss the hypothesis that
acquisition of knowledge is a deeply rooted psychological need, a motivational
mechanism for perception as well as higher cognition. We report experimental
results showing that acquisition of knowledge is emotionally pleasing. The
satisfaction of curiosity through acquiring knowledge brings pleasure. This
confirms the hypothesis that curiosity or need for knowledge is a fundamental
and ancient motivation on a par with other basic needs, such as sex or food.
This paper connects curiosity, knowledge, cognition, emotions, including
aesthetic emotions of the beautiful, mechanisms of drives, high cognitive
functions, minimization of cognitive effort through heuristics, and knowledge
maximization. We anticipate our finding to be an important aspect for several
classical fields including cognitive dissonance, personality, self, learning,
and new directions in cognitive science studying emotions related to acquiring
knowledge, personality types in relation to types of knowledge, relating higher
cognitive abilities to knowledge-related emotions, and new directions in
aesthetics revealing the cognitive nature of the beautiful and music.
