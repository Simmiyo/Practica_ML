Student Teaching and Research Laboratory Focusing on Brain-computer
  Interface Paradigms - A Creative Environment for Computer Science Students -
This paper presents an applied concept of a brain-computer interface (BCI)
student research laboratory (BCI-LAB) at the Life Science Center of TARA,
University of Tsukuba, Japan. Several successful case studies of the student
projects are reviewed together with the BCI Research Award 2014 winner case.
The BCI-LAB design and project-based teaching philosophy is also explained.
Future teaching and research directions summarize the review.
