Network algorithmics and the emergence of the cortical synaptic-weight
  distribution
When a neuron fires and the resulting action potential travels down its axon
toward other neurons' dendrites, the effect on each of those neurons is
mediated by the weight of the synapse that separates it from the firing neuron.
This weight, in turn, is affected by the postsynaptic neuron's response through
a mechanism that is thought to underlie important processes such as learning
and memory. Although of difficult quantification, cortical synaptic weights
have been found to obey a long-tailed unimodal distribution peaking near the
lowest values, thus confirming some of the predictive models built previously.
These models are all causally local, in the sense that they refer to the
situation in which a number of neurons all fire directly at the same
postsynaptic neuron. Consequently, they necessarily embody assumptions
regarding the generation of action potentials by the presynaptic neurons that
have little biological interpretability. In this letter we introduce a network
model of large groups of interconnected neurons and demonstrate, making none of
the assumptions that characterize the causally local models, that its long-term
behavior gives rise to a distribution of synaptic weights with the same
properties that were experimentally observed. In our model the action
potentials that create a neuron's input are, ultimately, the product of
network-wide causal chains relating what happens at a neuron to the firings of
others. Our model is then of a causally global nature and predicates the
emergence of the synaptic-weight distribution on network structure and
function. As such, it has the potential to become instrumental also in the
study of other emergent cortical phenomena.
