Types of Cognition and its Implications for future High-Level Cognitive
  Machines
This work summarizes part of current knowledge on High-level Cognitive
process and its relation with biological hardware. Thus, it is possible to
identify some paradoxes which could impact the development of future
technologies and artificial intelligence: we may make a High-level Cognitive
Machine, sacrificing the principal attribute of a machine, its accuracy.
