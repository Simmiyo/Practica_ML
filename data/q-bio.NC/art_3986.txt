Computing with space: a tangle formalism for chora and difference
What is space computing, simulation, or understanding? Converging from
several sources, this seems to be something more primitive than what is usually
meant by computation, something that was along with us since antiquity (the
word "choros", "chora", denotes "space" or "place" and is seemingly the most
mysterious notion from Plato, described in Timaeus 48e - 53c) which has to do
with cybernetics and with the understanding of the front end visual system. It
may have some unexpected applications, also. Here, inspired by Bateson (see
Supplementary Material), I explore from the mathematical side the point of view
that there is no difference between the map and the territory, but instead the
transformation of one into another can be understood by using a formalism of
tangle diagrams.
