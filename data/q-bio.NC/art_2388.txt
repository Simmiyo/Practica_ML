Chimera states in networks of nonlocally coupled Hindmarsh-Rose neuron
  models
We have identified the occurrence of chimera states for various coupling
schemes in networks of two-dimensional and three-dimensional Hindmarsh-Rose
oscillators, which represent realistic models of neuronal ensembles. This
result, together with recent studies on multiple chimera states in nonlocally
coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators, provide strong evidence that the
phenomenon of chimeras may indeed be relevant in neuroscience applications.
Moreover, our work verifies the existence of chimera states in coupled bistable
elements, whereas to date chimeras were known to arise in models possessing a
single stable limit cycle. Finally, we have identified an interesting class of
mixed oscillatory states, in which desynchronized neurons are uniformly
interspersed among the remaining ones that are either stationary or oscillate
in synchronized motion.
