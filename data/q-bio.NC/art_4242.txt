The Cerebellum: New Computational Model that Reveals its Primary
  Function to Calculate Multibody Dynamics Conform to Lagrange-Euler
  Formulation
Cerebellum is part of the brain that occupies only 10% of the brain volume,
but it contains about 80% of total number of brain neurons. New cerebellar
function model is developed that sets cerebellar circuits in context of
multibody dynamics model computations, as important step in controlling balance
and movement coordination, functions performed by two oldest parts of the
cerebellum. Model gives new functional interpretation for granule cells-Golgi
cell circuit, including distinct function for upper and lower Golgi cell
dendritc trees, and resolves issue of sharing Granule cells between Purkinje
cells. Sets new function for basket cells, and for stellate cells according to
position in molecular layer. New model enables easily and direct integration of
sensory information from vestibular system and cutaneous mechanoreceptors, for
balance, movement and interaction with environments. Model gives explanation of
Purkinje cells convergence on deep-cerebellar nuclei.
