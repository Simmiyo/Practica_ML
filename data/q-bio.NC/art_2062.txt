Delay before synchronization and its role in latency of sensory
  awareness
Here we show that for coupled-map systems, the length of the transient prior
to synchronization is both dependant on the coupling strength and dynamics of
connections: systems with fixed connections and with no self-coupling display
quasi-instantaneous synchronization. Too strong tendency for synchronization
would in terms of brain dynamics be expected to be a pathological case. We
relate how the time to synchrony depends on coupling strength and connection
dynamics to the latency between neuronal stimulation and conscious awareness.
We suggest that this latency can be identified with the delay before a
threshold level of synchrony is achieved between distinct regions within the
brain, as suggested by recent empirical evidence, in which case the latency can
easily be understood as the inevitable delay before such synchrony builds-up.
This is demonstrated here through the study of simplistic coupled-map models.
