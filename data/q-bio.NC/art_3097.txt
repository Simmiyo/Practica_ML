Electrocorticographic Dynamics Predict Visually Guided Motor Imagery of
  Grasp Shaping
Identification of intended movement type and movement phase of hand grasp
shaping are critical features for the control of volitional neuroprosthetics.
We demonstrate that neural dynamics during visually-guided imagined grasp
shaping can encode intended movement. We apply Procrustes analysis and LASSO
regression to achieve 72% accuracy (chance = 25%) in distinguishing between
visually-guided imagined grasp trajectories. Further, we can predict the stage
of grasp shaping in the form of elapsed time from start of trial (R2=0.4). Our
approach contributes to more accurate single-trial decoding of higher-level
movement goals and the phase of grasping movements in individuals not trained
with brain-computer interfaces. We also find that the overall time-varying
trajectory structure of imagined movements tend to be consistent within
individuals, and that transient trajectory deviations within trials return to
the task-dependent trajectory mean. These overall findings may contribute to
the further understanding of the cortical dynamics of human motor imagery.
