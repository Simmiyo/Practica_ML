Meanings, Metaphors, and Morphisms: Theory of Indeterminate Natural
  Transformation (TINT)
In the present paper, we propose a new theory named "Theory of indeterminate
natural transformation (TINT)" to investigate the dynamical creation of
meanings as association relationships between images, focusing on the metaphor
comprehension as an example. TINT models the meaning creation as a kind of
stochastic processes based on the mathematical structure defined by association
relationships as morphisms in category theory, so as to represent the
indeterminate nature of structure-structure interactions between the systems of
the meanings of images. Such interactions are formulated in terms of so-called
coslice categories and functors as structure-preserving correspondence between
them. The relationship between such functors is "indeterminate natural
transformation", the central notion in TINT, which models the creation of
meanings in a precise manner. For instance, the process of metaphor
comprehension is modeled by the construction of indeterminate natural
transformation from a canonically defined functor which we call the
base-of-metaphor functor.
