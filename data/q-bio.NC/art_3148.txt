Coalescent embedding in the hyperbolic space unsupervisedly discloses
  the hidden geometry of the brain
The human brain displays a complex network topology, whose structural
organization is widely studied using diffusion tensor imaging. The original
geometry from which emerges the network topology is known, as well as the
localization of the network nodes in respect to the brain morphology and
anatomy. One of the most challenging problems of current network science is to
infer the latent geometry from the mere topology of a complex network. The
human brain structural connectome represents the perfect benchmark to test
algorithms aimed to solve this problem. Coalescent embedding was recently
designed to map a complex network in the hyperbolic space, inferring the node
angular coordinates. Here we show that this methodology is able to
unsupervisedly reconstruct the latent geometry of the brain with an incredible
accuracy and that the intrinsic geometry of the brain networks strongly relates
to the lobes organization known in neuroanatomy. Furthermore, coalescent
embedding allowed the detection of geometrical pathological changes in the
connectomes of Parkinson's Disease patients. The present study represents the
first evidence of brain networks' angular coalescence in the hyperbolic space,
opening a completely new perspective, possibly towards the realization of
latent geometry network markers for evaluation of brain disorders and
pathologies.
