Characterizing synaptic conductance fluctuations in cortical neurons and
  their influence on spike generation
Cortical neurons are subject to sustained and irregular synaptic activity
which causes important fluctuations of the membrane potential (Vm). We review
here different methods to characterize this activity and its impact on spike
generation. The simplified, fluctuating point-conductance model of synaptic
activity provides the starting point of a variety of methods for the analysis
of intracellular Vm recordings. In this model, the synaptic excitatory and
inhibitory conductances are described by Gaussian-distributed stochastic
variables, or colored conductance noise. The matching of experimentally
recorded Vm distributions to an invertible theoretical expression derived from
the model allows the extraction of parameters characterizing the synaptic
conductance distributions. This analysis can be complemented by the matching of
experimental Vm power spectral densities (PSDs) to a theoretical template, even
though the unexpected scaling properties of experimental PSDs limit the
precision of this latter approach. Building on this stochastic characterization
of synaptic activity, we also propose methods to qualitatively and
quantitatively evaluate spike-triggered averages of synaptic time-courses
preceding spikes. This analysis points to an essential role for synaptic
conductance variance in determining spike times. The presented methods are
evaluated using controlled conductance injection in cortical neurons in vitro
with the dynamic-clamp technique. We review their applications to the analysis
of in vivo intracellular recordings in cat association cortex, which suggest a
predominant role for inhibition in determining both sub- and supra-threshold
dynamics of cortical neurons embedded in active networks.
