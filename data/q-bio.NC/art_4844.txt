Continual Lifelong Learning with Neural Networks: A Review
Humans and animals have the ability to continually acquire, fine-tune, and
transfer knowledge and skills throughout their lifespan. This ability, referred
to as lifelong learning, is mediated by a rich set of neurocognitive mechanisms
that together contribute to the development and specialization of our
sensorimotor skills as well as to long-term memory consolidation and retrieval.
Consequently, lifelong learning capabilities are crucial for autonomous agents
interacting in the real world and processing continuous streams of information.
However, lifelong learning remains a long-standing challenge for machine
learning and neural network models since the continual acquisition of
incrementally available information from non-stationary data distributions
generally leads to catastrophic forgetting or interference. This limitation
represents a major drawback for state-of-the-art deep neural network models
that typically learn representations from stationary batches of training data,
thus without accounting for situations in which information becomes
incrementally available over time. In this review, we critically summarize the
main challenges linked to lifelong learning for artificial learning systems and
compare existing neural network approaches that alleviate, to different
extents, catastrophic forgetting. We discuss well-established and emerging
research motivated by lifelong learning factors in biological systems such as
structural plasticity, memory replay, curriculum and transfer learning,
intrinsic motivation, and multisensory integration.
