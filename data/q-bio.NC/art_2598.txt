Airborne Ultrasonic Tactile Display BCI
This chapter presents results of our project, which studied whether
contactless and airborne ultrasonic tactile display (AUTD) stimuli delivered to
a user's palms could serve as a platform for a brain computer interface (BCI)
paradigm. We used six palm positions to evoke combined somatosensory brain
responses to implement a novel contactless tactile BCI. This achievement was
awarded the top prize in the Annual BCI Research Award 2014 competition. This
chapter also presents a comparison with a classical attached vibrotactile
transducer-based BCI paradigm. Experiment results from subjects performing
online experiments validate the novel BCI paradigm.
