Population rate coding in recurrent neuronal networks with
  undetermined-type neurons
Neural coding is a key problem in neuroscience, which can promote people's
understanding of the mechanism that brain processes information. Among the
classical theories of neural coding, the population rate coding has been
studied widely in many works. Most computational studies considered the neurons
and the corresponding presynaptic synapses as pre-determined excitatory or
inhibitory types. According to physiological evidence, however, that the real
effect of a synapse is inhibitory or excitatory is determined by the type of
the activated receptors. The co-release of excitatory and inhibitory receptors
in the same synapse exists widely in the brain. In this paper, we study the
population rate coding in recurrent neuronal networks with undetermined neurons
and synapses, different from the traditional works, in which one neuron can
perform either excitatory or inhibitory effect to the corresponding
postsynaptic neurons. We find such neuronal networks can encode the stimuli
information in population firing rate well. We find that intermediate recurrent
probability together with moderate Inhibitory-Excitatory strength ratio can
enhance the encoding performance. Suitable combinations of the previous two
parameters with the noise intensity, the excitatory synaptic strength and the
synaptic time constant have promoting effects on the performance of population
rate coding. Finally, we compare the performance of population rate coding
between the traditional (determined) model and ours, and we find that it is
rational to consider the co-release of inhibitory and excitatory receptors.
