Energy landscape analysis of neuroimaging data
Computational neuroscience models have been used for understanding neural
dynamics in the brain and how they may be altered when physiological or other
conditions change. We review and develop a data-driven approach to neuroimaging
data called the energy landscape analysis. The methods are rooted in
statistical physics theory, in particular the Ising model, also known as the
(pairwise) maximum entropy model and Boltzmann machine. The methods have been
applied to fitting electrophysiological data in neuroscience for a decade, but
their use in neuroimaging data is still in its infancy. We first review the
methods and discuss some algorithms and technical aspects. Then, we apply the
methods to functional magnetic resonance imaging data recorded from healthy
individuals to inspect the relationship between the accuracy of fitting, the
size of the brain system to be analyzed, and the data length.
