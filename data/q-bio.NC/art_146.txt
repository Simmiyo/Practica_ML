Comparison of two models of electric neuro-stimulation and consequences
  for the design of retinal prostheses
Two simple mathematical models of electric neuro-stimulation are derived and
discussed. It is found that the common injected-charge model is less realistic
than a model, in which a latency period, which follows after a short electric
pulse, plays a role as important as the electric pulse. A stimulation signal is
proposed that takes advantage of these findings and calls for experimental
testing.
