Arguments for Nested Patterns in Neural Ensembles
This paper describes a relatively simple way of allowing a brain model to
self-organise its concept patterns through nested structures. Time is a key
element and a simulator would be able to show how patterns may form and then
fire in sequence, as part of a search or thought process. It uses a very simple
equation to show how the inhibitors in particular, can switch off certain
areas, to allow other areas to become the prominent ones and thereby define the
current brain state. This allows for a small amount of control over what
appears to be a chaotic structure inside of the brain. It is attractive because
it is still mostly mechanical and therefore can be added as an automatic
process, or the modelling of that. The paper also describes how the nested
pattern structure can be used as a basic counting mechanism.
