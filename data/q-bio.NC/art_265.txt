Adaptive Drift-Diffusion Process to Learn Time Intervals
Animals learn the timing between consecutive events very easily. Their
precision is usually proportional to the interval to time (Weber's law for
timing). Most current timing models either require a central clock and
unbounded accumulator or whole pre-defined populations of delay lines, decaying
traces or oscillators to represent elapsing time. Current adaptive recurrent
neural networks fail at learning to predict the timing of future events (the
'when') in a realistic manner. In this paper, we present a new model of
interval timing, based on simple temporal integrators, derived from
drift-diffusion models. We develop a simple geometric rule to learn 'when'
instead of 'what'. We provide an analytical proof that the model can learn
inter-event intervals in a number of trials independent of the interval size
and that the temporal precision of the system is proportional to the timed
interval. This new model uses no clock, no gradient, no unbounded accumulators,
no delay lines, and has internal noise allowing generations of individual
trials. Three interesting predictions are made.
