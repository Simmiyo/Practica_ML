Signal processing in local neuronal circuits based on activity-dependent
  noise and competition
We study the characteristics of weak signal detection by a recurrent neuronal
network with plastic synaptic coupling. It is shown that in the presence of an
asynchronous component in synaptic transmission, the network acquires
selectivity with respect to the frequency of weak periodic stimuli. For
non-periodic frequency-modulated stimuli, the response is quantified by the
mutual information between input (signal) and output (network's activity), and
is optimized by synaptic depression. Introducing correlations in signal
structure resulted in the decrease of input-output mutual information. Our
results suggest that in neural systems with plastic connectivity, information
is not merely carried passively by the signal; rather, the information content
of the signal itself might determine the mode of its processing by a local
neuronal circuit.
