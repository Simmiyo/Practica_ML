Illusory Shapes via Phase Transition
We propose a new variational illusory shape (VIS) model via phase fields and
phase transitions. It is inspired by the first-order variational illusory
contour (VIC) model proposed by Jung and Shen [{\em J. Visual Comm. Image
Repres.}, {\bf 19}:42-55, 2008]. Under the new VIS model, illusory shapes are
represented by phase values close to 1 while the rest by values close to 0. The
0-1 transition is achieved by an elliptic energy with a double-well potential,
as in the theory of $\Gamma$-convergence. The VIS model is non-convex, with the
zero field as its trivial global optimum. To seek visually meaningful local
optima that can induce illusory shapes, an iterative algorithm is designed and
its convergence behavior is closely studied. Several generic numerical examples
confirm the versatility of the model and the algorithm.
