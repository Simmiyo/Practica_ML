Intracranial Error Detection via Deep Learning
Deep learning techniques have revolutionized the field of machine learning
and were recently successfully applied to various classification problems in
noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG). However, these methods were so far
only rarely evaluated for use in intracranial EEG. We employed convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) to classify and characterize the error-related brain
response as measured in 24 intracranial EEG recordings. Decoding accuracies of
CNNs were significantly higher than those of a regularized linear discriminant
analysis. Using time-resolved deep decoding, it was possible to classify errors
in various regions in the human brain, and further to decode errors over 200 ms
before the actual erroneous button press, e.g., in the precentral gyrus.
Moreover, deeper networks performed better than shallower networks in
distinguishing correct from error trials in all-channel decoding. In single
recordings, up to 100 % decoding accuracy was achieved. Visualization of the
networks' learned features indicated that multivariate decoding on an ensemble
of channels yields related, albeit non-redundant information compared to
single-channel decoding. In summary, here we show the usefulness of deep
learning for both intracranial error decoding and mapping of the
spatio-temporal structure of the human error processing network.
