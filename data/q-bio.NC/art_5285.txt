Linear Readout of Object Manifolds
Objects are represented in sensory systems by continuous manifolds due to
sensitivity of neuronal responses to changes in physical features such as
location, orientation, and intensity. What makes certain sensory
representations better suited for invariant decoding of objects by downstream
networks? We present a theory that characterizes the ability of a linear
readout network, the perceptron, to classify objects from variable neural
responses. We show how the readout perceptron capacity depends on the
dimensionality, size, and shape of the object manifolds in its input neural
representation.
