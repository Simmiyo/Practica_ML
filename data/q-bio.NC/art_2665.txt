Chromatic and High-frequency cVEP-based BCI Paradigm
We present results of an approach to a code-modulated visual evoked potential
(cVEP) based brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm using four high-frequency
flashing stimuli. To generate higher frequency stimulation compared to the
state-of-the-art cVEP-based BCIs, we propose to use the light-emitting diodes
(LEDs) driven from a small micro-controller board hardware generator designed
by our team. The high-frequency and green-blue chromatic flashing stimuli are
used in the study in order to minimize a danger of a photosensitive epilepsy
(PSE). We compare the the green-blue chromatic cVEP-based BCI accuracies with
the conventional white-black flicker based interface.
