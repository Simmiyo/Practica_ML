The placement of the head that maximizes predictability. An information
  theoretic approach
The minimization of the length of syntactic dependencies is a
well-established principle of word order and the basis of a mathematical theory
of word order. Here we complete that theory from the perspective of information
theory, adding a competing word order principle: the maximization of
predictability of a target element. These two principles are in conflict: to
maximize the predictability of the head, the head should appear last, which
maximizes the costs with respect to dependency length minimization. The
implications of such a broad theoretical framework to understand the
optimality, diversity and evolution of the six possible orderings of subject,
object and verb are reviewed.
