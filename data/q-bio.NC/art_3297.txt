Realizing Intelligence
Order exists in the world. The intelligence process enables us to realize
that order, to some extent. We provide a high level description of intelligence
using simple definitions, basic building blocks, a conceptual framework and
general hierarchy. This perspective includes multiple levels of abstraction
occurring in space and in time. The resulting model offers simple, useful ways
to help realize the essence of intelligence.
