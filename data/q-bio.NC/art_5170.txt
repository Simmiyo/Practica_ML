Enhancing performance of subject-specific models via subject-independent
  information for SSVEP-based BCIs
Recently, steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer
interface (BCI) has attracted much attention due to its high information
transfer rate (ITR) and increasing number of targets. However, the performance
of SSVEP-based methods in terms of accuracy and time length required for target
detection can be improved. We propose a new canonical correlation analysis
(CCA)-based method to integrate subject-specific models and subject-independent
information and enhance BCI performance. To optimize hyperparameters for
CCA-based model of a specific subject, we propose to use training data of other
subjects. An ensemble version of the proposed method is also developed and used
for a fair comparison with ensemble task-related component analysis (TRCA). A
publicly available 35-subject SSVEP benchmark dataset is used to evaluate
different methods. The proposed method is compared with TRCA and extended CCA
methods as reference methods. The performance of the methods is evaluated using
classification accuracy and ITR. Offline analysis results show that the
proposed method reaches highest ITR compared with TRCA and extended CCA. Also,
the proposed method significantly improves performance of extended CCA in all
conditions and TRCA for time windows greater than 0.3 s. In addition, the
proposed method outperforms TRCA for low number of training blocks and
electrodes. This study illustrates that adding subject-independent information
to subject-specific models can improve the performance of SSVEP-based BCIs.
