Concept based Attention
Attention endows animals an ability to concentrate on the most relevant
information among a deluge of distractors at any given time, either through
volitionally 'top-down' biasing, or driven by automatically 'bottom-up'
saliency of stimuli, in favour of advantageous competition in neural
modulations for information processing. Nevertheless, instead of being limited
to perceive simple features, human and other advanced animals adaptively learn
the world into categories and abstract concepts from experiences, imparting the
world meanings. This thesis suggests that the high-level cognitive ability of
human is more likely driven by attention basing on abstract perceptions, which
is defined as concept based attention (CbA).
