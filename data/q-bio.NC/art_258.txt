Model Cortical Association Fields Account for the Time Course and
  Dependence on Target Complexity of Human Contour Perception
Can lateral connectivity in the primary visual cortex account for the time
dependence and intrinsic task difficulty of human contour detection? To answer
this question, we created a synthetic image set that prevents sole reliance on
either low-level visual features or high-level context for the detection of
target objects. Rendered images consist of smoothly varying, globally aligned
contour fragments (amoebas) distributed among groups of randomly rotated
fragments (clutter). The time course and accuracy of amoeba detection by humans
was measured using a two-alternative forced choice protocol with self-reported
confidence and variable image presentation time (20-200 ms), followed by an
image mask optimized so as to interrupt visual processing. Measured
psychometric functions were well fit by sigmoidal functions with exponential
time constants of 30-91 ms, depending on amoeba complexity. Key aspects of the
psychophysical experiments were accounted for by a computational network model,
in which simulated responses across retinotopic arrays of orientation-selective
elements were modulated by cortical association fields, represented as
multiplicative kernels computed from the differences in pairwise edge
statistics between target and distractor images. Comparing the experimental and
the computational results suggests that each iteration of the lateral
interactions takes at least 37.5 ms of cortical processing time. Our results
provide evidence that cortical association fields between orientation selective
elements in early visual areas can account for important temporal and
task-dependent aspects of the psychometric curves characterizing human contour
perception, with the remaining discrepancies postulated to arise from the
influence of higher cortical areas.
