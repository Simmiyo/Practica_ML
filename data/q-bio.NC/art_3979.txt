Prime numbers and spontaneous neuron activity
Logarithmic gaps have been used in order to find a periodic component of the
sequence of prime numbers, hidden by a random noise (stochastic or chaotic). It
is shown that multiplicative nature of the noise is the main reason for the
successful application of the logarithmic gaps transforming the multiplicative
noise into an additive one. A relation of this phenomenon to spontaneous neuron
activity and to chaotic brain computations has been discussed.
