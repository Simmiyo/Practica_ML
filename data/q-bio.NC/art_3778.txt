Branching Law for Axons
What determines the caliber of axonal branches? We pursue the hypothesis that
the axonal caliber has evolved to minimize signal propagation delays, while
keeping arbor volume to a minimum. We show that for a general cost function the
optimal diameters of mother ($d_0$) and daughter ($d_1$, $d_2$) branches at a
bifurcation obey a branching law: $d_{0}^{\nu+2}=d_{1}^{\nu+2} +
d_{2}^{\nu+2}$. The derivation relies on the fact that the conduction speed
scales with the axon diameter to the power $\nu$ ($\nu=1$ for myelinated axons
and $\nu=0.5$ for non-myelinated axons). We test the branching law on the
available experimental data and find a reasonable agreement.
