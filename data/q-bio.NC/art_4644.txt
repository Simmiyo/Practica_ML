Decoding visual stimuli in human brain by using Anatomical Pattern
  Analysis on fMRI images
A universal unanswered question in neuroscience and machine learning is
whether computers can decode the patterns of the human brain. Multi-Voxels
Pattern Analysis (MVPA) is a critical tool for addressing this question.
However, there are two challenges in the previous MVPA methods, which include
decreasing sparsity and noises in the extracted features and increasing the
performance of prediction. In overcoming mentioned challenges, this paper
proposes Anatomical Pattern Analysis (APA) for decoding visual stimuli in the
human brain. This framework develops a novel anatomical feature extraction
method and a new imbalance AdaBoost algorithm for binary classification.
Further, it utilizes an Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) method for
multi-class prediction. APA can automatically detect active regions for each
category of the visual stimuli. Moreover, it enables us to combine homogeneous
datasets for applying advanced classification. Experimental studies on 4 visual
categories (words, consonants, objects and scrambled photos) demonstrate that
the proposed approach achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art
methods.
