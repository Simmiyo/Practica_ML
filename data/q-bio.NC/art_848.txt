Shannon entropy of brain functional complex networks under the influence
  of the psychedelic Ayahuasca
The entropic brain hypothesis holds that the key facts concerning
psychedelics are partially explained in terms of increased entropy of the
brain's functional connectivity. Ayahuasca is a psychedelic beverage of
Amazonian indigenous origin with legal status in Brazil in religious and
scientific settings. In this context, we use tools and concepts from the theory
of complex networks to analyze resting state fMRI data of the brains of human
subjects under two distinct conditions: (i) under ordinary waking state and
(ii) in an altered state of consciousness induced by ingestion of Ayahuasca. We
report an increase in the Shannon entropy of the degree distribution of the
networks subsequent to Ayahuasca ingestion. We also find increased local and
decreased global network integration. Our results are broadly consistent with
the entropic brain hypothesis. Finally, we discuss our findings in the context
of descriptions of "mind-expansion" frequently seen in self-reports of users of
psychedelic drugs.
