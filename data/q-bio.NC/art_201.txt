Semantic learning in autonomously active recurrent neural networks
The human brain is autonomously active, being characterized by a
self-sustained neural activity which would be present even in the absence of
external sensory stimuli. Here we study the interrelation between the
self-sustained activity in autonomously active recurrent neural nets and
external sensory stimuli.
  There is no a priori semantical relation between the influx of external
stimuli and the patterns generated internally by the autonomous and ongoing
brain dynamics. The question then arises when and how are semantic correlations
between internal and external dynamical processes learned and built up?
  We study this problem within the paradigm of transient state dynamics for the
neural activity in recurrent neural nets, i.e. for an autonomous neural
activity characterized by an infinite time-series of transiently stable
attractor states. We propose that external stimuli will be relevant during the
sensitive periods, {\it viz} the transition period between one transient state
and the subsequent semi-stable attractor. A diffusive learning signal is
generated unsupervised whenever the stimulus influences the internal dynamics
qualitatively.
  For testing we have presented to the model system stimuli corresponding to
the bars and stripes problem. We found that the system performs a non-linear
independent component analysis on its own, being continuously and autonomously
active. This emergent cognitive capability results here from a general
principle for the neural dynamics, the competition between neural ensembles.
