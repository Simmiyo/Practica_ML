A Self-Organized Neural Comparator
Learning algorithms need generally the possibility to compare several streams
of information. Neural learning architectures hence need a unit, a comparator,
able to compare several inputs encoding either internal or external
information, like for instance predictions and sensory readings. Without the
possibility of comparing the values of prediction to actual sensory inputs,
reward evaluation and supervised learning would not be possible.
  Comparators are usually not implemented explicitly, necessary comparisons are
commonly performed by directly comparing one-to-one the respective activities.
This implies that the characteristics of the two input streams (like size and
encoding) must be provided at the time of designing the system.
  It is however plausible that biological comparators emerge from
self-organizing, genetically encoded principles, which allow the system to
adapt to the changes in the input and in the organism.
  We propose an unsupervised neural circuitry, where the function of input
comparison emerges via self-organization only from the interaction of the
system with the respective inputs, without external influence or supervision.
  The proposed neural comparator adapts, unsupervised, according to the
correlations present in the input streams. The system consists of a multilayer
feed-forward neural network which follows a local output minimization
(anti-Hebbian) rule for adaptation of the synaptic weights.
  The local output minimization allows the circuit to autonomously acquire the
capability of comparing the neural activities received from different neural
populations, which may differ in the size of the population and in the neural
encoding used. The comparator is able to compare objects never encountered
before in the sensory input streams and to evaluate a measure of their
similarity, even when differently encoded.
