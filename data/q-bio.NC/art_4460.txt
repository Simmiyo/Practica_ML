Quantifying topological invariants of neuronal morphologies
Nervous systems are characterized by neurons displaying a diversity of
morphological shapes. Traditionally, different shapes have been qualitatively
described based on visual inspection and quantitatively described based on
morphometric parameters. Neither process provides a solid foundation for
categorizing the various morphologies, a problem that is important in many
fields. We propose a stable topological measure as a standardized descriptor
for any tree-like morphology, which encodes its skeletal branching anatomy.
More specifically it is a barcode of the branching tree as determined by a
spherical filtration centered at the root or neuronal soma. This Topological
Morphology Descriptor (TMD) allows for the discrimination of groups of random
and neuronal trees at linear computational cost.
