Human Brain Mapping based on COLD Signal Hemodynamic Response and
  Electrical Neuroimaging
To understand Working of Human Brain measurements related to the brain
function are required. These measurements should be possibly non-invasive.
Brain should be disturbed as less as possible during the measurement.
Integration of various modalities plays a vital role in understanding the
cognitive and the behavioral changes in the human brain. It is an important
source of converging evidence about specific aspects of neural functions and
dysfunctions under certain pathological conditions. Focal changes in cortical
blood flow are tightly coupled with the changes in neuronal activity. This
constitutes the option to map the hemodynamic response and infer principles of
the cortical processing, even of complex tasks. The very high temporal
resolution of EEG and good spatial resolution by NIRS make this concurrent
measurement unique to study the spatio-temporal dynamics of large scale
neuronal networks in the human brain. Such integration of two techniques will
help to overcome the limitations of a specific method. Such as insensitivity of
electroencephalogram (EEG) to unsynchronized neural events or lack of near
infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to low metabolic demand. A combination of EEG and
NIRS will be more informative than the two separate analyses in both
modalities.
