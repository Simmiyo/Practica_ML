Regions of multistability in some low-dimensional logistic models with
  excitation type coupling
A naive model of many networked logistic maps with an excitation type
coupling [Neural Networks, vol. 20, 102--108 (2007)], which is an extension of
other low dimensional models, has been recently proposed to mimic the
waking-sleeping bistability found in brain systems. Although the dynamics of
large and complex aggregates of elementary components can not be understood nor
extrapolated from the properties of a few components, some patterns of behavior
could be conserved independently of the topology and of the number of coupled
units. Following this insight, we have collected several of those systems where
a few logistic maps are coupled under a similar mutual excitation scheme. The
regions of bi- and multistability of these systems are sketched and reported.
