Spike timing precision and neural error correction: local behavior
The effects of spike timing precision and dynamical behavior on error
correction in spiking neurons were investigated. Stationary discharges -- phase
locked, quasiperiodic, or chaotic -- were induced in a simulated neuron by
presenting pacemaker presynaptic spike trains across a model of a prototypical
inhibitory synapse. Reduced timing precision was modeled by jittering
presynaptic spike times. Aftereffects of errors -- in this communication,
missed presynaptic spikes -- were determined by comparing postsynaptic spike
times between simulations identical except for the presence or absence of
errors. Results show that the effects of an error vary greatly depending on the
ongoing dynamical behavior. In the case of phase lockings, a high degree of
presynaptic spike timing precision can provide significantly faster error
recovery. For non-locked behaviors, isolated missed spikes can have little or
no discernible aftereffects (or even serve to paradoxically reduce uncertainty
in postsynaptic spike timing), regardless of presynaptic imprecision. This
suggests two possible categories of error correction: high-precision locking
with rapid recovery and low-precision non-locked with error immunity.
