Multi-command Tactile and Auditory Brain Computer Interface based on
  Head Position Stimulation
We study the extent to which vibrotactile stimuli delivered to the head of a
subject can serve as a platform for a brain computer interface (BCI) paradigm.
Six head positions are used to evoke combined somatosensory and auditory (via
the bone conduction effect) brain responses, in order to define a multimodal
tactile and auditory brain computer interface (taBCI). Experimental results of
subjects performing online taBCI, using stimuli with a moderately fast
inter-stimulus interval (ISI), validate the taBCI paradigm, while the
feasibility of the concept is illuminated through information transfer rate
case studies.
