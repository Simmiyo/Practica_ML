Wireless Optogenetic Nanonetworks: Device Model and Charging Protocols
In recent years, numerous research efforts have been dedicated towards
developing efficient implantable devices for brain stimulation. However, there
are limitations and challenges with the current technologies. Firstly, the
stimulation of neurons currently is possible through implantable electrodes but
limited to a population of neurons. Secondly, a major hurdle lies in developing
miniature devices that can last for a lifetime in the patient's brain. In
parallel, Optogenetics has emerged proposing the stimulation of neurons using
light by means of optical fibers inserted through the skull. Many challenges
are thus introduced in terms of suitability to patient's lifestyle and
biocompatibility. We have recently proposed the concept of wireless optogenetic
nanonetworking devices (WiOptND), addressing these long-term deployment
problems, and at the same time targeting single neuron stimulation [1]. The
WiOptND is equipped with a miniature LED that is able to stimulate a
genetically engineered neuron while harvesting energy from ultrasonic
vibrations. This paper investigates how light propagates in the brain tissue,
and based on the power required to emit sufficient intensity for stimulation,
an energy harvesting circuitry is designed. A number of charging protocols are
also proposed to maximize energy efficiency while ensuring minimum number of
neural spike misfirings. These protocols include the Charge and Fire, the
Predictive Sliding Detection Window, and its variant Markov-Chain based
Time-Delay Patterns. Simulation results show the drop of stimulation ratio for
25% and more stable trend in its efficiency ratio are exhibited on Markov-Chain
based Time-Delay Patterns compared to Change and Fire. The results show the
feasibility of utilizing WiOptND for long-term implants, and a new direction
towards precise stimulation of neurons in the cortical columns of the brain.
