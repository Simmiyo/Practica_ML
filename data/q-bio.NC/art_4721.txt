Comment on "Biologically inspired protection of deep networks from
  adversarial attacks"
A recent paper suggests that Deep Neural Networks can be protected from
gradient-based adversarial perturbations by driving the network activations
into a highly saturated regime. Here we analyse such saturated networks and
show that the attacks fail due to numerical limitations in the gradient
computations. A simple stabilisation of the gradient estimates enables
successful and efficient attacks. Thus, it has yet to be shown that the
robustness observed in highly saturated networks is not simply due to numerical
limitations.
