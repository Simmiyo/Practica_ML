Flies as Ship Captains? Digital Evolution Unravels Selective Pressures
  to Avoid Collision in Drosophila
Flies that walk in a covered planar arena on straight paths avoid colliding
with each other, but which of the two flies stops is not random.
High-throughput video observations, coupled with dedicated experiments with
controlled robot flies have revealed that flies utilize the type of optic flow
on their retina as a determinant of who should stop, a strategy also used by
ship captains to determine which of two ships on a collision course should
throw engines in reverse. We use digital evolution to test whether this
strategy evolves when collision avoidance is the sole penalty. We find that the
strategy does indeed evolve in a narrow range of cost/benefit ratios, for
experiments in which the "regressive motion" cue is error free. We speculate
that these stringent conditions may not be sufficient to evolve the strategy in
real flies, pointing perhaps to auxiliary costs and benefits not modeled in our
study
