Degree distributions in mesoscopic and macroscopic functional brain
  networks
We investigated the degree distribution of brain networks extracted from
functional magnetic resonance imaging of the human brain. In particular, the
distributions are compared between macroscopic brain networks using
region-based nodes and mesoscopic brain networks using voxel-based nodes. We
found that the distribution from these networks follow the same family of
distributions and represent a continuum of exponentially truncated power law
distributions.
