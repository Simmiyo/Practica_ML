Three-Stage Quantitative Neural Network Model of the Tip-of-the-Tongue
  Phenomenon
A new three-stage computer artificial neural network model of the
tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon is shortly described, and its stochastic nature
was demonstrated. A way to calculate strength and appearance probability of
tip-of-the-tongue states, neural network mechanism of feeling-of-knowing
phenomenon are proposed. The model synthesizes memory, psycholinguistic, and
metamemory approaches, bridges speech errors and naming chronometry research
traditions. A model analysis of a tip-of-the-tongue case from Anton Chekhov's
short story 'A Horsey Name' is performed. A new 'throw-up-one's-arms effect' is
defined.
