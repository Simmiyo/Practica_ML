A measure for the complexity of Boolean functions related to their
  implementation in neural networks
We define a measure for the complexity of Boolean functions related to their
implementation in neural networks, and in particular close related to the
generalization ability that could be obtained through the learning process. The
measure is computed through the calculus of the number of neighbor examples
that differ in their output value. Pairs of these examples have been previously
shown to be part of the minimum size training set needed to obtain perfect
generalization in feedforward neural networks.
  The main advantage of the proposed measure, in comparison to existing ones,
is the way in which the measure is evaluated, as it can be computed from the
definition of the function itself, independently of its implementation. The
validity of the proposal is analyzed through numerical simulations performed on
different feedforward neural networks architectures, and a good agreement is
obtained between the predicted complexity and the generalization ability for
different classes of functions.
  Also an interesting analogy was found between the proposed complexity measure
and the energy function of ferromagnetic systems, that could be exploited, by
use of the existing results and mathematical tools developed within a
statistical mechanics framework, to explore in a more rigorous way the
properties of Boolean functions when implemented on neural networks.
  We conjecture that the proposed measure could help as an useful tool for
carrying a systematic study of the computational capabilities of neural
networks, essentially by permitting an easy and reliable classification of
Boolean functions. Possible extensions of the work are also discussed.
