Ising-like dynamics in large-scale functional brain networks
Brain "rest" is defined -more or less unsuccessfully- as the state in which
there is no explicit brain input or output. This work focuss on the question of
whether such state can be comparable to any known \emph{dynamical} state. For
that purpose, correlation networks from human brain Functional Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (fMRI) are constrasted with correlation networks extracted
from numerical simulations of the Ising model in 2D, at different temperatures.
For the critical temperature $T_c$, striking similarities appear in the most
relevant statistical properties, making the two networks indistinguishable from
each other. These results are interpreted here as lending support to the
conjecture that the dynamics of the functioning brain is near a critical point.
