Efficient coding of spectrotemporal binaural sounds leads to emergence
  of the auditory space representation
To date a number of studies have shown that receptive field shapes of early
sensory neurons can be reproduced by optimizing coding efficiency of natural
stimulus ensembles. A still unresolved question is whether the efficient coding
hypothesis explains formation of neurons which explicitly represent
environmental features of different functional importance. This paper proposes
that the spatial selectivity of higher auditory neurons emerges as a direct
consequence of learning efficient codes for natural binaural sounds. Firstly,
it is demonstrated that a linear efficient coding transform - Independent
Component Analysis (ICA) trained on spectrograms of naturalistic simulated
binaural sounds extracts spatial information present in the signal. A simple
hierarchical ICA extension allowing for decoding of sound position is proposed.
Furthermore, it is shown that units revealing spatial selectivity can be
learned from a binaural recording of a natural auditory scene. In both cases a
relatively small subpopulation of learned spectrogram features suffices to
perform accurate sound localization. Representation of the auditory space is
therefore learned in a purely unsupervised way by maximizing the coding
efficiency and without any task-specific constraints. This results imply that
efficient coding is a useful strategy for learning structures which allow for
making behaviorally vital inferences about the environment.
