Broken chaotic clocks of brain neurons and depression
Irregular spiking time-series obtained in vitro and in vivo from singular
brain neurons of different types of rats are analyzed by mapping to telegraph
signals. Since the neural information is coded in the length of the interspike
intervals and their positions on the time axis, this mapping is the most direct
way to map a spike train into a signal which allows a proper application of the
Fourier transform methods. This analysis shows that healthy neurons firing has
periodic and chaotic deterministic clocks while for the rats representing
genetic animal model of human depression these neuron clocks might be broken,
that results in decoherence between the depressive neurons firing. Since
depression is usually accompanied by a narrowing of consciousness this specific
decoherence can be considered as a cause of the phenomenon of the consciousness
narrowing as well. This suggestion is also supported by observation of the
large-scale chaotic coherence of the posterior piriform and entorhinal
cortices' electrical activity at transition from anesthesia to the waking state
with full consciousness.
