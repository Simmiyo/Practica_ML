An explanation of the distribution of inter-seizure intervals
Recently Osorio et al (Eur. J. Neurosci., 30 (2009) 1554) reported that
probability distribution of intervals between successive epileptic seizures
follows a power law with exponent 1.5. We theoretically explain this finding by
modeling epileptic activity as a branching process, which we in turn
approximate by a random walk. We confirm the theoretical conclusion by
numerical simulation.
