Cortical spatio-temporal dimensionality reduction for visual grouping
The visual systems of many mammals, including humans, is able to integrate
the geometric information of visual stimuli and to perform cognitive tasks
already at the first stages of the cortical processing. This is thought to be
the result of a combination of mechanisms, which include feature extraction at
single cell level and geometric processing by means of cells connectivity. We
present a geometric model of such connectivities in the space of detected
features associated to spatio-temporal visual stimuli, and show how they can be
used to obtain low-level object segmentation. The main idea is that of defining
a spectral clustering procedure with anisotropic affinities over datasets
consisting of embeddings of the visual stimuli into higher dimensional spaces.
Neural plausibility of the proposed arguments will be discussed.
