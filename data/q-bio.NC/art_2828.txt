Lexical representation explains cortical entrainment during speech
  comprehension
Results from a recent neuroimaging study on spoken sentence comprehension
have been interpreted as evidence for cortical entrainment to hierarchical
syntactic structure. We present a simple computational model that predicts the
power spectra from this study, even though the model's linguistic knowledge is
restricted to the lexical level, and word-level representations are not
combined into higher-level units (phrases or sentences). Hence, the cortical
entrainment results can also be explained from the lexical properties of the
stimuli, without recourse to hierarchical syntax.
