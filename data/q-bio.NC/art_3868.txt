A view of Neural Networks as dynamical systems
We consider neural networks from the point of view of dynamical systems
theory. In this spirit we review recent results dealing with the following
questions, adressed in the context of specific models.
  1. Characterizing the collective dynamics; 2. Statistical analysis of spikes
trains; 3. Interplay between dynamics and network structure; 4. Effects of
synaptic plasticity.
