Sub-threshold CMOS Spiking Neuron Circuit Design for Navigation Inspired
  by C. elegans Chemotaxis
We demonstrate a spiking neural network for navigation motivated by the
chemotaxis network of Caenorhabditis elegans. Our network uses information
regarding temporal gradients in the tracking variable's concentration to make
navigational decisions. The gradient information is determined by mimicking the
underlying mechanisms of the ASE neurons of C. elegans. Simulations show that
our model is able to forage and track a target set-point in extremely noisy
environments. We develop a VLSI implementation for the main gradient detector
neurons, which could be integrated with standard comparator circuitry to
develop a robust circuit for navigation and contour tracking.
