Can Musical Emotion Be Quantified With Neural Jitter Or Shimmer? A Novel
  EEG Based Study With Hindustani Classical Music
The term jitter and shimmer has long been used in the domain of speech and
acoustic signal analysis as a parameter for speaker identification and other
prosodic features. In this study, we look forward to use the same parameters in
neural domain to identify and categorize emotional cues in different musical
clips. For this, we chose two ragas of Hindustani music which are
conventionally known to portray contrast emotions and EEG study was conducted
on 5 participants who were made to listen to 3 min clip of these two ragas with
sufficient resting period in between. The neural jitter and shimmer components
were evaluated for each experimental condition. The results reveal interesting
information regarding domain specific arousal of human brain in response to
musical stimuli and also regarding trait characteristics of an individual. This
novel study can have far reaching conclusions when it comes to modeling of
emotional appraisal. The results and implications are discussed in detail.
