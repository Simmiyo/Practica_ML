Supervised Learning in Multilayer Spiking Neural Networks
The current article introduces a supervised learning algorithm for multilayer
spiking neural networks. The algorithm presented here overcomes some
limitations of existing learning algorithms as it can be applied to neurons
firing multiple spikes and it can in principle be applied to any linearisable
neuron model. The algorithm is applied successfully to various benchmarks, such
as the XOR problem and the Iris data set, as well as complex classifications
problems. The simulations also show the flexibility of this supervised learning
algorithm which permits different encodings of the spike timing patterns,
including precise spike trains encoding.
