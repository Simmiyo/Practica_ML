Short-term synaptic plasticity in the deterministic Tsodyks-Markram
  model leads to unpredictable network dynamics
Short-Term Synaptic Plasticity (STSP) strongly affects the neural dynamics of
cortical networks. The Tsodyks and Markram (TM) model for STSP accurately
accounts for a wide range of physiological responses at different types of
cortical synapses. Here, we report for the first time a route to chaotic
behavior via a Shilnikov homoclinic bifurcation that dynamically organises some
of the responses in the TM model. In particular, the presence of such a
homoclinic bifurcation strongly affects the shape of the trajectories in the
phase space and induces highly irregular transient dynamics; indeed, in the
vicinity of the Shilnikov homoclinic bifurcation, the number of population
spikes and their precise timing are unpredictable and highly sensitive to the
initial conditions. Such an irregular deterministic dynamics has its
counterpart in stochastic/network versions of the TM model: the existence of
the Shilnikov homoclinic bifurcation generates complex and irregular spiking
patterns and --acting as a sort of springboard-- facilitates transitions
between the down-state and unstable periodic orbits. The interplay between the
(deterministic) homoclinic bifurcation and stochastic effects may give rise to
some of the complex dynamics observed in neural systems.
