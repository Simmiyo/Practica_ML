Quantum(-like) common knowledge: Binmore-Brandenburger operator approach
We present the detailed account of the quantum(-like) viewpoint to common
knowledge. The Binmore-Brandenburger operator approach to the notion of common
knowledge is extended to the quantum case. We develop a special quantum(-like)
model of common knowledge based on information representations of agents which
can be operationally represented by Hermitian operators. For simplicity, we
assume that each agent constructs her/his information representation by using
just one operator. However, different agents use in general representations
based on noncommuting operators, i.e., incompatible representations. The
quantum analog of basic system of common knowledge features ${\cal K}1-{\cal
K}5$ is derived.
