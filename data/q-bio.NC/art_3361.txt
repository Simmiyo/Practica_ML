Universality in human cortical folding across lobes of individual brains
Background: We have previously demonstrated that cortical folding across
mammalian species follows a universal scaling law that can be derived from a
simple theoretical model. The same scaling law has also been shown to hold
across brains of our own species, irrespective of age or sex. These results,
however, only relate measures of complete cortical hemispheres. There are known
systematic variations in morphology between different brain regions, and
region-specific changes with age. It is therefore of interest to extend our
analyses to different cortical regions, and analyze the scaling law within an
individual brain.
  Methods: To directly compare the morphology of sub-divisions of the cortical
surface in a size-independent manner, we base our method on a topological
invariant of closed surfaces. We reconstruct variables of a complete hemisphere
from each lobe of the brain so that it has the same gyrification index, average
thickness and average Gaussian curvature.
  Results: We show that different lobes are morphologically diverse but obey
the same scaling law that was observed across human subjects and across
mammalian species. This is also the case for subjects with Alzheimer's disease.
The age-dependent offset changes at similar rates for all lobes in healthy
subjects, but differs most dramatically in the temporal lobe in Alzheimer's
disease.
  Significance: Our results further support the idea that while morphological
parameters can vary locally across the cortical surface/across subjects of the
same species/across species, the processes that drive cortical gyrification are
universal.
