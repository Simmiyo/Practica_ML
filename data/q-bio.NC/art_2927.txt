Supervised Learning in Spiking Neural Networks for Precise Temporal
  Encoding
Precise spike timing as a means to encode information in neural networks is
biologically supported, and is advantageous over frequency-based codes by
processing input features on a much shorter time-scale. For these reasons, much
recent attention has been focused on the development of supervised learning
rules for spiking neural networks that utilise a temporal coding scheme.
However, despite significant progress in this area, there still lack rules that
have a theoretical basis, and yet can be considered biologically relevant. Here
we examine the general conditions under which synaptic plasticity most
effectively takes place to support the supervised learning of a precise
temporal code. As part of our analysis we examine two spike-based learning
methods: one of which relies on an instantaneous error signal to modify
synaptic weights in a network (INST rule), and the other one on a filtered
error signal for smoother synaptic weight modifications (FILT rule). We test
the accuracy of the solutions provided by each rule with respect to their
temporal encoding precision, and then measure the maximum number of input
patterns they can learn to memorise using the precise timings of individual
spikes as an indication of their storage capacity. Our results demonstrate the
high performance of FILT in most cases, underpinned by the rule's
error-filtering mechanism, which is predicted to provide smooth convergence
towards a desired solution during learning. We also find FILT to be most
efficient at performing input pattern memorisations, and most noticeably when
patterns are identified using spikes with sub-millisecond temporal precision.
In comparison with existing work, we determine the performance of FILT to be
consistent with that of the highly efficient E-learning Chronotron, but with
the distinct advantage that FILT is also implementable as an online method for
increased biological realism.
