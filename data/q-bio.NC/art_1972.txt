Inferring Neuronal Network Connectivity from Spike Data: A Temporal
  Datamining Approach
Understanding the functioning of a neural system in terms of its underlying
circuitry is an important problem in neuroscience. Recent developments in
electrophysiology and imaging allow one to simultaneously record activities of
hundreds of neurons. Inferring the underlying neuronal connectivity patterns
from such multi-neuronal spike train data streams is a challenging statistical
and computational problem. This task involves finding significant temporal
patterns from vast amounts of symbolic time series data. In this paper we show
that the frequent episode mining methods from the field of temporal data mining
can be very useful in this context. In the frequent episode discovery
framework, the data is viewed as a sequence of events, each of which is
characterized by an event type and its time of occurrence and episodes are
certain types of temporal patterns in such data. Here we show that, using the
set of discovered frequent episodes from multi-neuronal data, one can infer
different types of connectivity patterns in the neural system that generated
it. For this purpose, we introduce the notion of mining for frequent episodes
under certain temporal constraints; the structure of these temporal constraints
is motivated by the application. We present algorithms for discovering serial
and parallel episodes under these temporal constraints. Through extensive
simulation studies we demonstrate that these methods are useful for unearthing
patterns of neuronal network connectivity.
