Brain organization into resting state networks emerges at criticality on
  a model of the human connectome
The relation between large-scale brain structure and function is an
outstanding open problem in neuroscience. We approach this problem by studying
the dynamical regime under which realistic spatio-temporal patterns of brain
activity emerge from the empirically derived network of human brain
neuroanatomical connections. The results show that critical dynamics unfolding
on the structural connectivity of the human brain allow the recovery of many
key experimental findings obtained with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI), such as divergence of the correlation length, anomalous scaling of
correlation fluctuations, and the emergence of large-scale resting state
networks.
