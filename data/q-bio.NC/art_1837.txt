Mathematical Analysis and Simulations of the Neural Circuit for
  Locomotion in Lamprey
We analyze the dynamics of the neural circuit of the lamprey central pattern
generator (CPG). This analysis provides insights into how neural interactions
form oscillators and enable spontaneous oscillations in a network of damped
oscillators, which were not apparent in previous simulations or abstract phase
oscillator models. We also show how the different behaviour regimes
(characterized by phase and amplitude relationships between oscillators) of
forward/backward swimming, and turning, can be controlled using the neural
connection strengths and external inputs.
