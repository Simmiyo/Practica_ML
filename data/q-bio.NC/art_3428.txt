Dynamic Adaptive Computation: Tuning network states to task requirements
Neural circuits are able to perform computations under very diverse
conditions and requirements. The required computations impose clear constraints
on their fine-tuning: a rapid and maximally informative response to stimuli in
general requires decorrelated baseline neural activity. Such network dynamics
is known as asynchronous-irregular. In contrast, spatio-temporal integration of
information requires maintenance and transfer of stimulus information over
extended time periods. This can be realized at criticality, a phase transition
where correlations, sensitivity and integration time diverge. Being able to
flexibly switch, or even combine the above properties in a task-dependent
manner would present a clear functional advantage. We propose that cortex
operates in a "reverberating regime" because it is particularly favorable for
ready adaptation of computational properties to context and task. This
reverberating regime enables cortical networks to interpolate between the
asynchronous-irregular and the critical state by small changes in effective
synaptic strength or excitation-inhibition ratio. These changes directly adapt
computational properties, including sensitivity, amplification, integration
time and correlation length within the local network. We review recent
converging evidence that cortex in vivo operates in the reverberating regime,
and that various cortical areas have adapted their integration times to
processing requirements. In addition, we propose that neuromodulation enables a
fine-tuning of the network, so that local circuits can either decorrelate or
integrate, and quench or maintain their input depending on task. We argue that
this task-dependent tuning, which we call "dynamic adaptive computation",
presents a central organization principle of cortical networks and discuss
first experimental evidence.
