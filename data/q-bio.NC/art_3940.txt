Percolation Approach to Study Connectivity in Living Neural Networks
We study neural connectivity in cultures of rat hippocampal neurons. We
measure the neurons' response to an electric stimulation for gradual lower
connectivity, and characterize the size of the giant cluster in the network.
The connectivity undergoes a percolation transition described by the critical
exponent $\beta \simeq 0.65$. We use a theoretic approach based on
bond.percolation on a graph to describe the process of disintegration of the
network and extract its statistical properties. Together with numerical
simulations we show that the connectivity in the neural culture is local,
characterized by a gaussian degree distribution and not a power law on
