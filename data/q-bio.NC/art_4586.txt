Critical dynamics on a large human Open Connectome network
Extended numerical simulations of threshold models have been performed on a
human brain network with N=836733 connected nodes available from the Open
Connectome project. While in case of simple threshold models a sharp
discontinuous phase transition without any critical dynamics arises, variable
thresholds models exhibit extended power-law scaling regions. This is
attributed to fact that Griffiths effects, stemming from the
topological/interaction heterogeneity of the network, can become relevant if
the input sensitivity of nodes is equalized. I have studied the effects effects
of link directness, as well as the consequence of inhibitory connections.
Non-universal power-law avalanche size and time distributions have been found
with exponents agreeing with the values obtained in electrode experiments of
the human brain. The dynamical critical region occurs in an extended control
parameter space without the assumption of self organized criticality.
