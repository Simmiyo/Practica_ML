Psychophysical Responses Comparison in Spatial Visual, Audiovisual, and
  Auditory BCI-Spelling Paradigms
The paper presents a pilot study conducted with spatial visual, audiovisual
and auditory brain-computer-interface (BCI) based speller paradigms. The
psychophysical experiments are conducted with healthy subjects in order to
evaluate a difficulty and a possible response accuracy variability. We also
present preliminary EEG results in offline BCI mode. The obtained results
validate a thesis, that spatial auditory only paradigm performs as good as the
traditional visual and audiovisual speller BCI tasks.
