Distributed Recurrent Neural Forward Models with Synaptic Adaptation for
  Complex Behaviors of Walking Robots
Walking animals, like stick insects, cockroaches or ants, demonstrate a
fascinating range of locomotive abilities and complex behaviors. The locomotive
behaviors can consist of a variety of walking patterns along with adaptation
that allow the animals to deal with changes in environmental conditions, like
uneven terrains, gaps, obstacles etc. Biological study has revealed that such
complex behaviors are a result of a combination of biome- chanics and neural
mechanism thus representing the true nature of embodied interactions. While the
biomechanics helps maintain flexibility and sustain a variety of movements, the
neural mechanisms generate movements while making appropriate predictions
crucial for achieving adaptation. Such predictions or planning ahead can be
achieved by way of in- ternal models that are grounded in the overall behavior
of the animal. Inspired by these findings, we present here, an artificial
bio-inspired walking system which effectively com- bines biomechanics (in terms
of the body and leg structures) with the underlying neural mechanisms. The
neural mechanisms consist of 1) central pattern generator based control for
generating basic rhythmic patterns and coordinated movements, 2) distributed
(at each leg) recurrent neural network based adaptive forward models with
efference copies as internal models for sensory predictions and instantaneous
state estimations, and 3) searching and elevation control for adapting the
movement of an individual leg to deal with different environmental conditions.
Using simulations we show that this bio-inspired approach with adaptive
internal models allows the walking robot to perform complex loco- motive
behaviors as observed in insects, including walking on undulated terrains,
crossing large gaps as well as climbing over high obstacles...
