First-spike based visual categorization using reward-modulated STDP
Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently regained popularity, with major
achievements such as beating the European game of Go champion. Here, for the
first time, we show that RL can be used efficiently to train a spiking neural
network (SNN) to perform object recognition in natural images without using an
external classifier. We used a feedforward convolutional SNN and a temporal
coding scheme where the most strongly activated neurons fire first, while less
activated ones fire later, or not at all. In the highest layers, each neuron
was assigned to an object category, and it was assumed that the stimulus
category was the category of the first neuron to fire. If this assumption was
correct, the neuron was rewarded, i.e. spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP)
was applied, which reinforced the neuron's selectivity. Otherwise, anti-STDP
was applied, which encouraged the neuron to learn something else. As
demonstrated on various image datasets (Caltech, ETH-80, and NORB), this reward
modulated STDP (R-STDP) approach extracted particularly discriminative visual
features, whereas classic unsupervised STDP extracts any feature that
consistently repeats. As a result, R-STDP outperformed STDP on these datasets.
Furthermore, R-STDP is suitable for online learning, and can adapt to drastic
changes such as label permutations. Finally, it is worth mentioning that both
feature extraction and classification were done with spikes, using at most one
spike per neuron. Thus the network is hardware friendly and energy efficient.
