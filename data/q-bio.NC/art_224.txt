Fractals in the Nervous System: conceptual Implications for Theoretical
  Neuroscience
This essay is presented with two principal objectives in mind: first, to
document the prevalence of fractals at all levels of the nervous system, giving
credence to the notion of their functional relevance; and second, to draw
attention to the as yet still unresolved issues of the detailed relationships
among power law scaling, self-similarity, and self-organized criticality. As
regards criticality, I will document that it has become a pivotal reference
point in Neurodynamics. Furthermore, I will emphasize the not yet fully
appreciated significance of allometric control processes. For dynamic fractals,
I will assemble reasons for attributing to them the capacity to adapt task
execution to contextual changes across a range of scales. The final Section
consists of general reflections on the implications of the reviewed data, and
identifies what appear to be issues of fundamental importance for future
research in the rapidly evolving topic of this review.
