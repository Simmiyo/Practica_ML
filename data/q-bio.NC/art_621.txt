The influence of infant-directed speech on 12-month-olds' intersensory
  perception of fluent speech
The present study examined whether infant-directed (ID) speech facilitates
intersensory matching of audio--visual fluent speech in 12-month-old infants.
German-learning infants\^a audio--visual matching ability of German and French
fluent speech was assessed by using a variant of the intermodal matching
procedure, with auditory and visual speech information presented sequentially.
In Experiment 1, the sentences were spoken in an adult-directed (AD) manner.
Results showed that 12-month-old infants did not exhibit a matching performance
for the native, nor for the non-native language. However, Experiment 2 revealed
that when ID speech stimuli were used, infants did perceive the relation
between auditory and visual speech attributes, but only in response to their
native language. Thus, the findings suggest that ID speech might have an
influence on the intersensory perception of fluent speech and shed further
light on multisensory perceptual narrowing.
