Emotional control - conditio sine qua non for advanced artificial
  intelligences?
Humans dispose of two intertwined information processing pathways, cognitive
information processing via neural firing patterns and diffusive volume control
via neuromodulation. The cognitive information processing in the brain is
traditionally considered to be the prime neural correlate of human
intelligence, clinical studies indicate that human emotions intrinsically
correlate with the activation of the neuromodulatory system.
  We examine here the question: Why do humans dispose of the diffusive
emotional control system? Is this a coincidence, a caprice of nature, perhaps a
leftover of our genetic heritage, or a necessary aspect of any advanced
intelligence, being it biological or synthetic? We argue here that emotional
control is necessary to solve the motivational problem, viz the selection of
short-term utility functions, in the context of an environment where
information, computing power and time constitute scarce resources.
