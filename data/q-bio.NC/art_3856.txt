Phase Response Curves of Coupled Oscillators
Many real oscillators are coupled to other oscillators and the coupling can
affect the response of the oscillators to stimuli. We investigate phase
response curves (PRCs) of coupled oscillators. The PRCs for two weakly coupled
phase-locked oscillators are analytically obtained in terms of the PRC for
uncoupled oscillators and the coupling function of the system. Through
simulation and analytic methods, the PRCs for globally coupled oscillators are
also discussed.
