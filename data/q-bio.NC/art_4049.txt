Desynchronizing effect of high-frequency stimulation in a generic
  cortical network model
Transcranial Electrical Stimulation (TCES) and Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)
are two different applications of electrical current to the brain used in
different areas of medicine. Both have a similar frequency dependence of their
efficiency, with the most pronounced effects around 100Hz. We apply
superthreshold electrical stimulation, specifically depolarizing DC current,
interrupted at different frequencies, to a simple model of a population of
cortical neurons which uses phenomenological descriptions of neurons by
Izhikevich and synaptic connections on a similar level of sophistication. With
this model, we are able to reproduce the optimal desynchronization around
100Hz, as well as to predict the full frequency dependence of the efficiency of
desynchronization, and thereby to give a possible explanation for the action
mechanism of TCES.
