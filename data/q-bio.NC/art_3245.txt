First Draft on the xInf Model for Universal Physical Computation and
  Reverse Engineering of Natural Intelligence
Turing Machines are universal computing machines in theory. It has been a
long debate whether Turing Machines can simulate the consciousness mind
behaviors in the materialistic universe. Three different hypotheses come out of
such debate, in short:(A) Can; (B) Cannot; (C) Super-Turing machines can.
Because Turing Machines or other kinds of theoretical computing models are
abstract objects while behaviors are real observables, this debate involves at
least three distinct fields of science and technology: physics, computer
engineering, and experimental neuroscience. However, the languages used in
these different fields are highly heterogeneous and not easily interpretable
for each other, making it very difficult to reach partial agreements regarding
this debate, Therefore, the main goal of this manuscript is to establish a
proper language that can translate among those different fields. First, I
propose a theoretical model for analyzing how theoretical computing machines
would physically run in physical time. This model, termed as the xInf, is at
first place Turing-complete in theory, and depending on the properties of
physical time, it can be either Turing-equivalent or Super-Turing in the
physical universe. The xInf Model is demonstrated to be a suitable universal
language to translate among physics, computer engineering, and neuroscience.
Finally, I propose a conjecture that there exists a Minimal Complete Set of
rules in the xInf Model that enables the construction of a physical machine
using inorganic materials that can pass the Turing Test in physical time. I
cannot demonstrate whether such a conjecture to be testified or falsified on
paper using finite-order logic, my only solution is physical time itself, i.e.
an evolutionary competition will eventually tell the conclusion.
