A comment on "A fast L_p spike alignment metric" by A. J. Dubbs, B. A.
  Seiler and M. O. Magnasco [arXiv:0907.3137]
Measuring the transmitted information in metric-based clustering has become
something of a standard test for the performance of a spike train metric. In
this comment, the recently proposed L_p Victor-Purpura metric is used to
cluster spiking responses to zebra finch songs, recorded from field L of
anesthetized zebra finch. It is found that for these data the L_p metrics with
p>1 modestly outperform the standard, p=1, Victor-Purpura metric. It is argued
that this is because for larger values of p, the metric comes closer to
performing windowed coincidence detection.
