Optimal Channel Efficiency in a Sensory Network
We show that the entropy of the distribution of avalanche lifetimes in the
Kinouchi-Copelli model always achieves a maximum jointly with the dynamic
range. This is noteworthy and nontrivial because while the dynamic range is an
equilibrium average measure of the sensibility of a sensory system to a
stimulus, the entropy of relaxation times is a purely dynamical quantity,
independent of the stimulus rate, that can be interpreted as the efficiency of
the network seen as a communication channel. The newly found optimization
occurs for all topologies we tested, even when the distribution of avalanche
lifetimes itself is not a power-law and when the entropy of the size
distribution of avalanches is not concomitantly maximized, strongly suggesting
that dynamical rules allowing a proper temporal matching of the states of the
interacting neurons is the key for achieving good performance in information
processing, rather than increasing the number of available units.
