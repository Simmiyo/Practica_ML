Firing Rate of Noisy Integrate-and-fire Neurons with Synaptic Current
  Dynamics
We derive analytical formulae for the firing rate of integrate-and-fire
neurons endowed with realistic synaptic dynamics. In particular we include the
possibility of multiple synaptic inputs as well as the effect of an absolute
refractory period into the description.
