The Organization of Strong Links in Complex Networks
A small-world topology characterizes many complex systems including the
structural and functional organization of brain networks. The topology allows
simultaneously for local and global efficiency in the interaction of the system
constituents. However, it ignores the gradations of interactions commonly
quantified by the link weight, w. Here, we identify an integrative weight
organization for brain, gene, social, and language networks, in which strong
links preferentially occur between nodes with overlapping neighbourhoods and
the small-world properties are robust to removal of a large fraction of the
weakest links. We also determine local learning rules that dynamically
establish such weight organization in response to past activity and capacity
demands, while preserving efficient local and global communication.
