Neuromorphic electronic circuits for building autonomous cognitive
  systems
Several analog and digital brain-inspired electronic systems have been
recently proposed as dedicated solutions for fast simulations of spiking neural
networks. While these architectures are useful for exploring the computational
properties of large-scale models of the nervous system, the challenge of
building low-power compact physical artifacts that can behave intelligently in
the real-world and exhibit cognitive abilities still remains open. In this
paper we propose a set of neuromorphic engineering solutions to address this
challenge. In particular, we review neuromorphic circuits for emulating neural
and synaptic dynamics in real-time and discuss the role of biophysically
realistic temporal dynamics in hardware neural processing architectures; we
review the challenges of realizing spike-based plasticity mechanisms in real
physical systems and present examples of analog electronic circuits that
implement them; we describe the computational properties of recurrent neural
networks and show how neuromorphic Winner-Take-All circuits can implement
working-memory and decision-making mechanisms. We validate the neuromorphic
approach proposed with experimental results obtained from our own circuits and
systems, and argue how the circuits and networks presented in this work
represent a useful set of components for efficiently and elegantly implementing
neuromorphic cognition.
