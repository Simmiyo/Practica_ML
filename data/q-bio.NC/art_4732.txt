The Social Benefits of Balancing Creativity and Imitation: Evidence from
  an Agent-based Model
Although creativity is encouraged in the abstract it is often discouraged in
educational and workplace settings. Using an agent-based model of cultural
evolution, we investigated the idea that tempering the novelty-generating
effects of creativity with the novelty-preserving effects of imitation is
beneficial for society. In Experiment One we systematically introduced
individual differences in creativity, and observed a trade-off between the
ratio of creators to imitators, and how creative the creators were. Excess
creativity was detrimental because creators invested in unproven ideas at the
expense of propagating proven ones. Experiment Two tested the hypothesis that
society as a whole benefits if individuals adjust how creative they are in
accordance with their creative success. When effective creators created more,
and ineffective creators created less (social regulation), the agents
segregated into creators and imitators, and the mean fitness of outputs was
temporarily higher. We hypothesized that the temporary nature of the effect was
due to a ceiling on output fitness. In Experiment Three we made the space of
possible outputs open-ended by giving agents the capacity to chain simple
outputs into arbitrarily complex ones such that fitter outputs were always
possible. With the capacity for chained outputs, the effect of social
regulation could indeed be maintained indefinitely. The results are discussed
in light of empirical data.
