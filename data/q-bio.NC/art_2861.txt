An ancestral axial twist explains the contralateral forebrain and the
  optic chiasm in vertebrates
Among the best-known facts of the brain are the contralateral visual,
auditory, sensational, and motor mappings in the forebrain. How and why did
these evolve? The few theories to this question provide functional answers,
such as better networks for visuomotor control. However, these theories
contradict the data, as discussed here. Instead we propose that a 90-deg
left-turn around the body-axis evolved in a common ancestor of all vertebrates.
Compensatory migrations of the tissues during development restore body
symmetry. Eyes, nostrils and forebrain compensate in the direction of the turn,
whereas more caudal structures migrate in the opposite direction. As a result
of these opposite migrations the forebrain becomes crossed and inverted with
respect to the rest of the nervous system. We show that these compensatory
migratory movements can indeed be observed in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) and
the chick (Gallus gallus). With a model we show how the axial twist hypothesis
predicts that an optic chiasm should develop on the ventral side of the brain,
whereas the olfactory tract should be uncrossed. In addition, the hypothesis
explains the decussation of the trochlear nerve, why olfaction is non-crossed,
why the cerebellar hemispheres represent the ipsilateral bodyside, why in
sharks the forebrain halves each represent the ipsilateral eye, why the heart
and other inner organs are asymmetric in the body. Due to the poor fossil
record, the possible evolutionary scenarios remain speculative. Molecular
evidence does support the hypothesis. The findings may throw new insight on the
problematic structure of the forebrain.
