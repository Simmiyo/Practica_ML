A Repeated Signal Difference for Recognising Patterns
This paper describes a new mechanism that might help with defining pattern
sequences, by the fact that it can produce an upper bound on the ensemble value
that can persistently oscillate with the actual values produced from each
pattern. With every firing event, a node also receives an on/off feedback
switch. If the node fires, then it sends a feedback result depending on the
input signal strength. If the input signal is positive or larger, it can store
an 'on' switch feedback for the next iteration. If the signal is negative or
smaller, it can store an 'off' switch feedback for the next iteration. If the
node does not fire, then it does not affect the current feedback situation and
receives the switch command produced by the last active pattern event for the
same neuron. The upper bound therefore also represents the largest or most
enclosing pattern set and the lower value is for the actual set of firing
patterns. If the pattern sequence repeats, it will oscillate between the two
values, allowing them to be recognised and measured more easily, over time.
Tests show that changing the sequence ordering produces different value sets,
which can also be measured.
