Information In The Non-Stationary Case
Information estimates such as the ``direct method'' of Strong et al. (1998)
sidestep the difficult problem of estimating the joint distribution of response
and stimulus by instead estimating the difference between the marginal and
conditional entropies of the response. While this is an effective estimation
strategy, it tempts the practitioner to ignore the role of the stimulus and the
meaning of mutual information. We show here that, as the number of trials
increases indefinitely, the direct (or ``plug-in'') estimate of marginal
entropy converges (with probability 1) to the entropy of the time-averaged
conditional distribution of the response, and the direct estimate of the
conditional entropy converges to the time-averaged entropy of the conditional
distribution of the response. Under joint stationarity and ergodicity of the
response and stimulus, the difference of these quantities converges to the
mutual information. When the stimulus is deterministic or non-stationary the
direct estimate of information no longer estimates mutual information, which is
no longer meaningful, but it remains a measure of variability of the response
distribution across time.
