Averaging Transformations of Synaptic Potentials on Networks
The problem of the transformation of microscopic information to the
macroscopic level is an intriguing challenge in computational neuroscience, but
also of general mathematical importance. Here, a phenomenological mathematical
model is introduced that simulates the internal information processing of brain
compartments. Synaptic potentials are integrated over small number of
realistically coupled neurons to obtain macroscopic quantities. The striatal
complex, an important part of the basal ganglia circuit in the brain for
regulating motor activity, has been investigated as an example for the
validation of the model.
