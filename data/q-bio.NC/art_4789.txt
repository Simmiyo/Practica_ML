Anatomical Pattern Analysis for decoding visual stimuli in human brains
Background: A universal unanswered question in neuroscience and machine
learning is whether computers can decode the patterns of the human brain.
Multi-Voxels Pattern Analysis (MVPA) is a critical tool for addressing this
question. However, there are two challenges in the previous MVPA methods, which
include decreasing sparsity and noise in the extracted features and increasing
the performance of prediction.
  Methods: In overcoming mentioned challenges, this paper proposes Anatomical
Pattern Analysis (APA) for decoding visual stimuli in the human brain. This
framework develops a novel anatomical feature extraction method and a new
imbalance AdaBoost algorithm for binary classification. Further, it utilizes an
Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) method for multiclass prediction. APA can
automatically detect active regions for each category of the visual stimuli.
Moreover, it enables us to combine homogeneous datasets for applying advanced
classification.
  Results and Conclusions: Experimental studies on 4 visual categories (words,
consonants, objects and scrambled photos) demonstrate that the proposed
approach achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art methods.
