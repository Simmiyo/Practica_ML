Building machines that adapt and compute like brains
Building machines that learn and think like humans is essential not only for
cognitive science, but also for computational neuroscience, whose ultimate goal
is to understand how cognition is implemented in biological brains. A new
cognitive computational neuroscience should build cognitive-level and neural-
level models, understand their relationships, and test both types of models
with both brain and behavioral data.
