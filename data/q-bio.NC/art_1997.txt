Localization of Simultaneous Multiple Sources using SMS-LORETA
In this paper we present a new localization method SMS-LORETA (Simultaneous
Multiple Sources- Low Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography), capable to
locate efficiently multiple simultaneous sources. The new method overcomes some
of the drawbacks of sLORETA (standardized Low Resolution Brain Electromagnetic
Tomography). The key idea of the new method is the iterative search for current
dipoles, harnessing the low error single source localization performance of
sLORETA. An evaluation of the new method by simulation has been enclosed.
