Proceedings of the Workshop on Brain Analysis using COnnectivity
  Networks - BACON 2016
Understanding brain connectivity in a network-theoretic context has shown
much promise in recent years. This type of analysis identifies brain
organisational principles, bringing a new perspective to neuroscience. At the
same time, large public databases of connectomic data are now available.
However, connectome analysis is still an emerging field and there is a crucial
need for robust computational methods to fully unravelits potential. This
workshop provides a platform to discuss the development of new analytic
techniques; methods for evaluating and validating commonly used approaches; as
well as the effects of variations in pre-processing steps.
