Dwelling Quietly in the Rich Club: Brain Network Determinants of Slow
  Cortical Fluctuations
For more than a century, cerebral cartography has been driven by
investigations of structural and morphological properties of the brain across
spatial scales and the temporal/functional phenomena that emerge from these
underlying features. The next era of brain mapping will be driven by studies
that consider both of these components of brain organization simultaneously --
elucidating their interactions and dependencies. Using this guiding principle,
we explored the origin of slowly fluctuating patterns of synchronization within
the topological core of brain regions known as the rich club, implicated in the
regulation of mood and introspection. We find that a constellation of densely
interconnected regions that constitute the rich club (including the anterior
insula, amygdala, and precuneus) play a central role in promoting a stable,
dynamical core of spontaneous activity in the primate cortex. The slow time
scales are well matched to the regulation of internal visceral states,
corresponding to the somatic correlates of mood and anxiety. In contrast, the
topology of the surrounding "feeder" cortical regions show unstable, rapidly
fluctuating dynamics likely crucial for fast perceptual processes. We discuss
these findings in relation to psychiatric disorders and the future of
connectomics.
