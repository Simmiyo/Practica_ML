A predictive processing model of perception and action for self-other
  distinction
During interaction with others, we perceive and produce social actions in
close temporal distance or even simultaneously. It has been argued that the
motor system is involved in perception and action, playing a fundamental role
in the handling of actions produced by oneself and by others. But how does it
distinguish in this processing between self and other, thus contributing to
self-other distinction? In this paper we propose a hierarchical model of
sensorimotor coordination based on principles of perception-action coupling and
predictive processing in which self-other distinction arises during action and
perception. For this we draw on mechanisms assumed for the integration of cues
for a sense of agency, i.e., the sense that an action is self-generated. We
report results from simulations of different scenarios, showing that the model
is not only able to minimize free energy during perception and action, but also
showing that the model can correctly attribute sense of agency to own actions.
