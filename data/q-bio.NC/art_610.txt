The Budapest Reference Connectome Server v2.0
The connectomes of different human brains are pairwise distinct: we cannot
talk about an abstract "graph of the brain". Two typical connectomes, however,
have quite a few common graph edges that may describe the same connections
between the same cortical areas. The Budapest Reference Connectome Server Ver.
2.0 (http://connectome.pitgroup.org) generates the common edges of the
connectomes of 96 distinct cortexes, each with 1015 vertices, computed from 96
MRI data sets of the Human Connectome Project. The user may set numerous
parameters for the identification and filtering of common edges, and the graphs
are downloadable in both csv and GraphML formats; both formats carry the
anatomical annotations of the vertices, generated by the Freesurfer program.
The resulting consensus graph is also automatically visualized in a 3D rotating
brain model on the website.
  The consensus graphs, generated with various parameter settings, can be used
as reference connectomes based on different, independent MRI images, therefore
they may serve as reduced-error, low-noise, robust graph representations of the
human brain.
