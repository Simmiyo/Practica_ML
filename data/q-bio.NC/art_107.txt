Adaptive Filtering Enhances Information Transmission in Visual Cortex
Sensory neuroscience seeks to understand how the brain encodes natural
environments. However, neural coding has largely been studied using simplified
stimuli. In order to assess whether the brain's coding strategy depend on the
stimulus ensemble, we apply a new information-theoretic method that allows
unbiased calculation of neural filters (receptive fields) from responses to
natural scenes or other complex signals with strong multipoint correlations. In
the cat primary visual cortex we compare responses to natural inputs with those
to noise inputs matched for luminance and contrast. We find that neural filters
adaptively change with the input ensemble so as to increase the information
carried by the neural response about the filtered stimulus. Adaptation affects
the spatial frequency composition of the filter, enhancing sensitivity to
under-represented frequencies in agreement with optimal encoding arguments.
Adaptation occurs over 40 s to many minutes, longer than most previously
reported forms of adaptation.
