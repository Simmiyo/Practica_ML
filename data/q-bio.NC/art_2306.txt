Auditory Steady-State Response Stimuli based BCI Application - The
  Optimization of the Stimuli Types and Lengths
We propose a method for an improvement of auditory BCI (aBCI) paradigm based
on a combination of ASSR stimuli optimization by choosing the subjects' best
responses to AM-, flutter-, AM/FM and click-envelope modulated sounds. As the
ASSR response features we propose pairwise phase-locking-values calculated from
the EEG and next classified using binary classifier to detect attended and
ignored stimuli. We also report on a possibility to use the stimuli as short as
half a second, which is a step forward in ASSR based aBCI. The presented
results are helpful for optimization of the aBCI stimuli for each subject.
