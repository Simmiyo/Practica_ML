Evaluation of the training objectives with surface electromyography
In this work the multifractal analysis of the kinesiological surface
electromyographic signal is proposed. The goal was to investigate the level of
neuromuscular activation during complex movements on the laparoscopic trainer.
The basic issue of this work concerns the changes observed in the signal
obtained from the complete beginner in the field of using laparoscopic tools
and the same person subjected to the series of training. To quantify the
complexity of the kinesiological sEMG, the nonlinear analysis technique, namely
the MultiFractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis was adopted. The analysis was
based on the parameters describing the multifractal spectrum -- Hurst exponent
and the spectrum width. The statistically significant differences for a
selected group of muscles at the different states (before and after training)
are presented. Additionally, as the base case, the relaxation state was
considered and compared with the working states.
