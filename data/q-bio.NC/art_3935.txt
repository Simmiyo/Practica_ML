Illusions in the Ring Model of visual orientation selectivity
The Ring Model of orientation tuning is a dynamical model of a hypercolumn of
visual area V1 in the human neocortex that has been designed to account for the
experimentally observed orientation tuning curves by local, i.e.,
cortico-cortical computations. The tuning curves are stationary, i.e. time
independent, solutions of this dynamical model. One important assumption
underlying the Ring Model is that the LGN input to V1 is weakly tuned to the
retinal orientation and that it is the local computations in V1 that sharpen
this tuning. Because the equations that describe the Ring Model have built-in
equivariance properties in the synaptic weight distribution with respect to a
particular group acting on the retinal orientation of the stimulus, the model
in effect encodes an infinite number of tuning curves that are arbitrarily
translated with respect to each other. By using the Orbit Space Reduction
technique we rewrite the model equations in canonical form as functions of
polynomials that are invariant with respect to the action of this group. This
allows us to combine equivariant bifurcation theory with an efficient numerical
continuation method in order to compute the tuning curves predicted by the Ring
Model. Surprisingly some of these tuning curves are not tuned to the stimulus.
We interpret them as neural illusions and show numerically how they can be
induced by simple dynamical stimuli. These neural illusions are important
biological predictions of the model. If they could be observed experimentally
this would be a strong point in favour of the Ring Model. We also show how our
theoretical analysis allows to very simply specify the ranges of the model
parameters by comparing the model predictions with published experimental
observations.
