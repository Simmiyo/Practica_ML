Learning Feedforward and Recurrent Deterministic Spiking Neuron Network
  Feedback Controllers
We address the problem of learning feedback control where the controller is a
network constructed solely of deterministic spiking neurons. In contrast to
previous investigations that were based on a spike rate model of the neuron,
the control signal here is determined by the precise temporal positions of
spikes generated by the output neurons of the network. We model the problem
formally as a hybrid dynamical system comprised of a closed loop between a
plant and a spiking neuron network. We derive a novel synaptic weight update
rule via which the spiking neuron network controller learns to hold process
variables at desired set points. The controller achieves its learning objective
based solely on access to the plant's process variables and their derivatives
with respect to changing control signals; in particular, it requires no
internal model of the plant. We demonstrate the efficacy of the rule by
applying it to the classical control problem of the cart-pole (inverted
pendulum) and a model of fish locomotion. Experiments show that the proposed
controller has a stability region comparable to a traditional PID controller,
its trajectories differ qualitatively from those of a PID controller, and in
many instances the controller achieves its objective using very sparse spike
train outputs.
