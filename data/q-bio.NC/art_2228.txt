Effect of synaptic plasticity in the structure and dynamics of
  disordered networks of coupled neurons
In an all-to-all network of integrate-fire oscillators in which there is a
disorder in the intrinsic firing rates of the neurons, we show that through
spike timing-dependent plasticity the links which have the faster oscillators
as presynaptic, tend to be strengthened while the links originated from the
slow spiking neurons are weakened. The emergent effective flow of directed
connections, introduces the faster neurons as the more influent elements in the
network and facilitates synchronization by decreasing the synaptic cost for
onset of synchronization.
