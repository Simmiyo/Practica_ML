Control of synchronization patterns in neural-like Boolean networks
We study experimentally the synchronization patterns in time-delayed directed
Boolean networks of excitable systems. We observe a transition in the network
dynamics when the refractory time of the individual systems is adjusted. When
the refractory time is on the same order-of-magnitude as the mean link time
delays or the heterogeneities of the link time delays, cluster synchronization
patterns change, or are suppressed entirely, respectively. We also show that
these transitions occur when we only change the properties of a small number of
nodes identified by their larger in-degree, hence the synchronization patterns
can be controlled locally by these nodes. Our findings have implications for
synchronization in biological neural networks.
