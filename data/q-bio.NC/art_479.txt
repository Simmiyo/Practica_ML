Sleep, Neuroengineering and Dynamics
Modeling of consciousness-related phenomena and neuroengineering are fields
that are rapidly growing together. We review recent approaches and developments
and point out some promising directions of future research: Understanding the
dynamics of consciousness states and associated oscillations, pathological
oscillations as well as their treatment by stimulation, neuroprosthetics and
brain-computer-interface approaches, and stimulation approaches that probe,
influence and strengthen memory consolidation. In all these fields,
computational models connect theory, neurophysiology and neuroengineering
research and pave a way towards medical applications.
