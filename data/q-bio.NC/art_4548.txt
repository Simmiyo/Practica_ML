Information theoretic interpretation of frequency domain connectivity
  measures
To provide adequate multivariate measures of information flow between neural
structures, modified expressions of Partial Directed Coherence (PDC) and
Directed Transfer Function (DTF), two popular multivariate connectivity
measures employed in neuroscience, are introduced and their formal relationship
to mutual information rates are proved.
