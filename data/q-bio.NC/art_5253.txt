A memristive nanoparticle/organic hybrid synapstor for neuro-inspired
  computing
A large effort is devoted to the research of new computing paradigms
associated to innovative nanotechnologies that should complement and/or propose
alternative solutions to the classical Von Neumann/CMOS association. Among
various propositions, Spiking Neural Network (SNN) seems a valid candidate. (i)
In terms of functions, SNN using relative spike timing for information coding
are deemed to be the most effective at taking inspiration from the brain to
allow fast and efficient processing of information for complex tasks in
recognition or classification. (ii) In terms of technology, SNN may be able to
benefit the most from nanodevices, because SNN architectures are intrinsically
tolerant to defective devices and performance variability. Here we demonstrate
Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP), a basic and primordial learning
function in the brain, with a new class of synapstor (synapse-transistor),
called Nanoparticle Organic Memory Field Effect Transistor (NOMFET). We show
that this learning function is obtained with a simple hybrid material made of
the self-assembly of gold nanoparticles and organic semiconductor thin films.
Beyond mimicking biological synapses, we also demonstrate how the shape of the
applied spikes can tailor the STDP learning function. Moreover, the experiments
and modeling show that this synapstor is a memristive device. Finally, these
synapstors are successfully coupled with a CMOS platform emulating the pre- and
post-synaptic neurons, and a behavioral macro-model is developed on usual
device simulator.
