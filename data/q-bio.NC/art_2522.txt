A binary Hopfield network with $1/\log(n)$ information rate and
  applications to grid cell decoding
A Hopfield network is an auto-associative, distributive model of neural
memory storage and retrieval. A form of error-correcting code, the Hopfield
network can learn a set of patterns as stable points of the network dynamic,
and retrieve them from noisy inputs -- thus Hopfield networks are their own
decoders. Unlike in coding theory, where the information rate of a good code
(in the Shannon sense) is finite but the cost of decoding does not play a role
in the rate, the information rate of Hopfield networks trained with
state-of-the-art learning algorithms is of the order ${\log(n)}/{n}$, a
quantity that tends to zero asymptotically with $n$, the number of neurons in
the network. For specially constructed networks, the best information rate
currently achieved is of order ${1}/{\sqrt{n}}$. In this work, we design simple
binary Hopfield networks that have asymptotically vanishing error rates at an
information rate of ${1}/{\log(n)}$. These networks can be added as the
decoders of any neural code with noisy neurons. As an example, we apply our
network to a binary neural decoder of the grid cell code to attain information
rate ${1}/{\log(n)}$.
