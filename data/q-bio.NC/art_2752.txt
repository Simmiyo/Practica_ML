Encoding Data for HTM Systems
Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) is a biologically inspired machine
intelligence technology that mimics the architecture and processes of the
neocortex. In this white paper we describe how to encode data as Sparse
Distributed Representations (SDRs) for use in HTM systems. We explain several
existing encoders, which are available through the open source project called
NuPIC, and we discuss requirements for creating encoders for new types of data.
