Discrete Modeling of Multi-Transmitter Neural Networks with Neuron
  Competition
We propose a novel discrete model of central pattern generators (CPG),
neuronal ensembles generating rhythmic activity. The model emphasizes the role
of nonsynaptic interactions and the diversity of electrical properties in
nervous systems. Neurons in the model release different neurotransmitters into
the shared extracellular space (ECS) so each neuron with the appropriate set of
receptors can receive signals from other neurons. We consider neurons,
differing in their electrical activity, represented as finite-state machines
functioning in discrete time steps. Discrete modeling is aimed to provide a
computationally tractable and compact explanation of rhythmic pattern
generation in nervous systems. The important feature of the model is the
introduced mechanism of neuronal competition which is shown to be responsible
for the generation of proper rhythms. The model is illustrated with two
examples: a half-center oscillator considered to be a basic mechanism of
emerging rhythmic activity and the well-studied feeding network of a pond
snail. Future research will focus on the neuromodulatory effects ubiquitous in
CPG networks and the whole nervous systems.
