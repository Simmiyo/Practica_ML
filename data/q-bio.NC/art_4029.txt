Fast Approximate Quadratic Programming for Large (Brain) Graph Matching
Quadratic assignment problems (QAPs) arise in a wide variety of domains,
ranging from operations research to graph theory to computer vision to
neuroscience. In the age of big data, graph valued data is becoming more
prominent, and with it, a desire to run algorithms on ever larger graphs.
Because QAP is NP-hard, exact algorithms are intractable. Approximate
algorithms necessarily employ an accuracy/efficiency trade-off. We developed a
fast approximate quadratic assignment algorithm (FAQ). FAQ finds a local optima
in (worst case) time cubic in the number of vertices, similar to other
approximate QAP algorithms. We demonstrate empirically that our algorithm is
faster and achieves a lower objective value on over 80% of the suite of QAP
benchmarks, compared with the previous state-of-the-art. Applying the
algorithms to our motivating example, matching C. elegans connectomes
(brain-graphs), we find that FAQ achieves the optimal performance in record
time, whereas none of the others even find the optimum.
