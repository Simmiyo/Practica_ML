STDP as presynaptic activity times rate of change of postsynaptic
  activity
We introduce a weight update formula that is expressed only in terms of
firing rates and their derivatives and that results in changes consistent with
those associated with spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) rules and
biological observations, even though the explicit timing of spikes is not
needed. The new rule changes a synaptic weight in proportion to the product of
the presynaptic firing rate and the temporal rate of change of activity on the
postsynaptic side. These quantities are interesting for studying theoretical
explanation for synaptic changes from a machine learning perspective. In
particular, if neural dynamics moved neural activity towards reducing some
objective function, then this STDP rule would correspond to stochastic gradient
descent on that objective function.
