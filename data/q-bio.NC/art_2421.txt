Conceptual Closure: How Memories are Woven into an Interconnected
  Worldview
This paper describes a tentative model for how discrete memories transform
into an interconnected conceptual network, or worldview, wherein relationships
between memories are forged by way of abstractions. The model draws on
Kauffman's theory of how an information-evolving system could emerge through
the formation and closure of an autocatalytic network. Here, the information
units are not catalytic molecules, but memories and abstractions, and the
process that connects them is not catalysis but reminding events (i.e. one
memory evokes another). The result is a worldview that both structures, and is
structured by, self-triggered streams of thought.
