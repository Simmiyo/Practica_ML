Finite-State Channel Models for Signal Transduction in Neural Systems
Information theory provides powerful tools for understanding communication
systems. This analysis can be applied to intercellular signal transduction,
which is a means of chemical communication among cells and microbes. We discuss
how to apply information-theoretic analysis to ligand-receptor systems, which
form the signal carrier and receiver in intercellular signal transduction
channels. We also discuss the applications of these results to neuroscience.
