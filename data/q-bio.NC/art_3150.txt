Stochastic resonance and optimal information transfer at criticality on
  a network model of the human connectome
Stochastic resonance is a phenomenon in which noise enhances the response of
a system to an input signal. The brain is an example of a system that has to
detect and transmit signals in a noisy environment, suggesting that it is a
good candidate to take advantage of SR. In this work, we aim to identify the
optimal levels of noise that promote signal transmission through a simple
network model of the human brain. Specifically, using a dynamic model
implemented on an anatomical brain network (connectome), we investigate the
similarity between an input signal and a signal that has traveled across the
network while the system is subject to different noise levels. We find that
non-zero levels of noise enhance the similarity between the input signal and
the signal that has traveled through the system. The optimal noise level is not
unique; rather, there is a set of parameter values at which the information is
transmitted with greater precision, this set corresponds to the parameter
values that place the system in a critical regime. The multiplicity of critical
points in our model allows it to adapt to different noise situations and remain
at criticality.
