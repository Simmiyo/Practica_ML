Computer modeling of feelings and emotions: a quantitative neural
  network model of the feeling-of-knowing
The first quantitative neural network model of feelings and emotions is
proposed on the base of available data on their neuroscience and evolutionary
biology nature, and on a neural network human memory model which admits
distinct description of conscious and unconscious mental processes in a time
dependent manner. As an example, proposed model is applied to quantitative
description of the feeling of knowing.
