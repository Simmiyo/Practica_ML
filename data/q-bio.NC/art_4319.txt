Estimating the intrinsic dimension in fMRI space via dataset fractal
  analysis - Counting the `cpu cores' of the human brain
Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a powerful non-invasive tool
for localizing and analyzing brain activity. This study focuses on one very
important aspect of the functional properties of human brain, specifically the
estimation of the level of parallelism when performing complex cognitive tasks.
Using fMRI as the main modality, the human brain activity is investigated
through a purely data-driven signal processing and dimensionality analysis
approach. Specifically, the fMRI signal is treated as a multi-dimensional data
space and its intrinsic `complexity' is studied via dataset fractal analysis
and blind-source separation (BSS) methods. One simulated and two real fMRI
datasets are used in combination with Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and
fractal analysis for estimating the intrinsic (true) dimensionality, in order
to provide data-driven experimental evidence on the number of independent brain
processes that run in parallel when visual or visuo-motor tasks are performed.
Although this number is can not be defined as a strict threshold but rather as
a continuous range, when a specific activation level is defined, a
corresponding number of parallel processes or the casual equivalent of `cpu
cores' can be detected in normal human brain activity.
