Active causation and the origin of meaning
Purpose and meaning are necessary concepts for understanding mind and
culture, but appear to be absent from the physical world and are not part of
the explanatory framework of the natural sciences. Understanding how meaning
(in the broad sense of the term) could arise from a physical world has proven
to be a tough problem. The basic scheme of Darwinian evolution produces
adaptations that only represent apparent ("as if") goals and meaning. Here I
use evolutionary models to show that a slight, evolvable extension of the basic
scheme is sufficient to produce genuine goals. The extension, targeted
modulation of mutation rate, is known to be generally present in biological
cells, and gives rise to two phenomena that are absent from the non-living
world: intrinsic meaning and the ability to initiate goal-directed chains of
causation (active causation). The extended scheme accomplishes this by
utilizing randomness modulated by a feedback loop that is itself regulated by
evolutionary pressure. The mechanism can be extended to behavioural variability
as well, and thus shows how freedom of behaviour is possible. A further
extension to communication suggests that the active exchange of intrinsic
meaning between organisms may be the origin of consciousness, which in
combination with active causation can provide a physical basis for the
phenomenon of free will.
