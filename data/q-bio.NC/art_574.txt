A Unified Framework for Information Coding: Oscillations, Memory, and
  Zombie Modes
Synchronous neural activity can improve neural processing and is believed to
mediate neuronal interaction by providing temporal windows during which
information is more easily transferred. We demonstrate a pulse gating mechanism
in a feedforward network that can exactly propagate graded information through
a multilayer circuit. Based on this mechanism, we present a unified framework
wherein neural information coding and processing can be considered as a product
of linear maps under the active control of a pulse generator. Distinct control
and processing components combine to form the basis for the binding,
propagation, and processing of dynamically routed information within neural
pathways. Using our framework, we construct example neural circuits to 1)
maintain a short-term memory, 2) compute time-windowed Fourier transforms, and
3) perform spatial rotations. We postulate that such circuits, with stereotyped
control and processing of information, are the neural correlates of Crick and
Koch's zombie modes.
