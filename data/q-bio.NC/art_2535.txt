Dynamics of Random Neural Networks with Bistable Units
We construct and analyze a rate-based neural network model in which
self-interacting units represent clusters of neurons with strong local
connectivity and random inter-unit connections reflect long-range interactions.
When sufficiently strong, the self-interactions make the individual units
bistable. Simulation results, mean-field calculations and stability analysis
reveal the different dynamic regimes of this network and identify the locations
in parameter space of its phase transitions. We identify an interesting
dynamical regime exhibiting transient but long-lived chaotic activity that
combines features of chaotic and multiple fixed-point attractors.
