Explaining the Logical Nature of Electrical Solitons in Neural Circuits
Neurons are modeled electrically based on ferroelectric membranes thin enough
to permit charge transfer, conjectured to be the tunneling result of thermally
energetic ions and random electrons. These membranes can be triggered to
produce electrical solitons, the main signals for brain associative memory and
logical processing. Dendritic circuits are modeled, and electrical solitons are
simulated to demonstrate the nature of soliton propagation, soliton reflection,
the collision of solitons, as well as soliton OR gates, AND gates, XOR gates
and NOT gates.
