Adaptation to criticality through organizational invariance in embodied
  agents
Many biological and cognitive systems do not operate deep within one or other
regime of activity. Instead, they are poised at critical points located at
phase transitions in their parameter space. The pervasiveness of criticality
suggests that there may be general principles inducing this behaviour, yet
there is no well-founded theory for understanding how criticality is generated
at a wide span of levels and contexts. In order to explore how criticality
might emerge from general adaptive mechanisms, we propose a simple learning
rule that maintains an internal organizational structure from a specific family
of systems at criticality. We implement the mechanism in artificial embodied
agents controlled by a neural network maintaining a correlation structure
randomly sampled from an Ising model at critical temperature. Agents are
evaluated in two classical reinforcement learning scenarios: the Mountain Car
and the Acrobot double pendulum. In both cases the neural controller appears to
reach a point of criticality, which coincides with a transition point between
two regimes of the agent's behaviour. These results suggest that adaptation to
criticality could be used as a general adaptive mechanism in some
circumstances, providing an alternative explanation for the pervasive presence
of criticality in biological and cognitive systems.
