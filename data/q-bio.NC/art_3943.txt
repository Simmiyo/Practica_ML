The Physics of Living Neural Networks
Improvements in technique in conjunction with an evolution of the theoretical
and conceptual approach to neuronal networks provide a new perspective on
living neurons in culture. Organization and connectivity are being measured
quantitatively along with other physical quantities such as information, and
are being related to function. In this review we first discuss some of these
advances, which enable elucidation of structural aspects. We then discuss two
recent experimental models that yield some conceptual simplicity. A
one-dimensional network enables precise quantitative comparison to analytic
models, for example of propagation and information transport. A two-dimensional
percolating network gives quantitative information on connectivity of cultured
neurons. The physical quantities that emerge as essential characteristics of
the network in vitro are propagation speeds, synaptic transmission, information
creation and capacity. Potential application to neuronal devices is discussed.
