Advances in Artificial Intelligence: Deep Intentions, Shallow
  Achievements
Over the past decade, AI has made a remarkable progress due to recently
revived Deep Learning technology. Deep Learning enables to process large
amounts of data using simplified neuron networks that simulate the way in which
the brain works. At the same time, there is another point of view that posits
that brain is processing information, not data. This duality hampered AI
progress for years. To provide a remedy for this situation, I propose a new
definition of information that considers it as a coupling between two separate
entities - physical information (that implies data processing) and semantic
information (that provides physical information interpretation). In such a
case, intelligence arises as a result of information processing. The paper
points on the consequences of this turn for the AI design philosophy.
