Functional modularity of background activities in normal and epileptic
  brain networks
We analyze the connectivity structure of weighted brain networks extracted
from spontaneous magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals of healthy subjects and
epileptic patients (suffering from absence seizures) recorded at rest. We find
that, for the activities in the 5-14 Hz range, healthy brains exhibit a sparse
connectivity, whereas the brain networks of patients display a rich
connectivity with clear modular structure. Our results suggest that modularity
plays a key role in the functional organization of brain areas during normal
and pathological neural activities at rest.
