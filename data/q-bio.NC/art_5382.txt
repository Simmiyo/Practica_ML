Collective Animal Behavior from Bayesian Estimation and Probability
  Matching
Animals living in groups make movement decisions that depend, among other
factors, on social interactions with other group members. Our present
understanding of social rules in animal collectives is mainly based on
empirical fits to observations, with less emphasis in obtaining
first-principles approaches that allow their derivation. Here we show that
patterns of collective decisions can be derived from the basic ability of
animals to make probabilistic estimations in the presence of uncertainty. We
build a decision-making model with two stages: Bayesian estimation and
probabilistic matching. In the first stage, each animal makes a Bayesian
estimation of which behavior is best to perform taking into account personal
information about the environment and social information collected by observing
the behaviors of other animals. In the probability matching stage, each animal
chooses a behavior with a probability equal to the Bayesian-estimated
probability that this behavior is the most appropriate one. This model derives
very simple rules of interaction in animal collectives that depend only on two
types of reliability parameters, one that each animal assigns to the other
animals and another given by the quality of the non-social information. We test
our model by obtaining theoretically a rich set of observed collective patterns
of decisions in three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, a shoaling
fish species. The quantitative link shown between probabilistic estimation and
collective rules of behavior allows a better contact with other fields such as
foraging, mate selection, neurobiology and psychology, and gives predictions
for experiments directly testing the relationship between estimation and
collective behavior.
