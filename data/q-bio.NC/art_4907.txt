EEG-GAN: Generative adversarial networks for electroencephalograhic
  (EEG) brain signals
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are recently highly successful in
generative applications involving images and start being applied to time series
data. Here we describe EEG-GAN as a framework to generate
electroencephalographic (EEG) brain signals. We introduce a modification to the
improved training of Wasserstein GANs to stabilize training and investigate a
range of architectural choices critical for time series generation (most
notably up- and down-sampling). For evaluation we consider and compare
different metrics such as Inception score, Frechet inception distance and
sliced Wasserstein distance, together showing that our EEG-GAN framework
generated naturalistic EEG examples. It thus opens up a range of new generative
application scenarios in the neuroscientific and neurological context, such as
data augmentation in brain-computer interfacing tasks, EEG super-sampling, or
restoration of corrupted data segments. The possibility to generate signals of
a certain class and/or with specific properties may also open a new avenue for
research into the underlying structure of brain signals.
