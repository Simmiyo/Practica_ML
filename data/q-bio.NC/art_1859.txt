Receptive Field and Feature Map Formation in the Primary Visual Cortex
  via Hebbian Learning with Inhibitory Feedback
A linear neural network is proposed for mamalian vision system in which
backward connections from the primary visual cortex (V1) to the lateral
geniculate nucleus play a key role. The backward connections control the flow
of information from the LGN to V1 in such a way as to maximize the rate of
transfer of information from the LGN to V1. The application of hebbian learning
to the forward and backward connections causes the formation of receptive
fields which are sensitive to edges, bars, and spatial frequencies of preferred
orientations. Receptive field types in V1 are shown to depend on the density of
the afferent connections in the LGN. Orientational preferences are organized in
the primary visual cortex by the application of lateral interactions during the
learning phase. Change in the size of the eye between the immature and mature
animal is shown be an important factor in the development of V1 organization.
The orgainization of the mature network is compared to that found in the
macaque monkey by several analytical tests.
