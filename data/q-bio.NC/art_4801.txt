Deep Transfer Learning for Error Decoding from Non-Invasive EEG
We recorded high-density EEG in a flanker task experiment (31 subjects) and
an online BCI control paradigm (4 subjects). On these datasets, we evaluated
the use of transfer learning for error decoding with deep convolutional neural
networks (deep ConvNets). In comparison with a regularized linear discriminant
analysis (rLDA) classifier, ConvNets were significantly better in both intra-
and inter-subject decoding, achieving an average accuracy of 84.1 % within
subject and 81.7 % on unknown subjects (flanker task). Neither method was,
however, able to generalize reliably between paradigms. Visualization of
features the ConvNets learned from the data showed plausible patterns of brain
activity, revealing both similarities and differences between the different
kinds of errors. Our findings indicate that deep learning techniques are useful
to infer information about the correctness of action in BCI applications,
particularly for the transfer of pre-trained classifiers to new recording
sessions or subjects.
