Deep Classification of Epileptic Signals
Electrophysiological observation plays a major role in epilepsy evaluation.
However, human interpretation of brain signals is subjective and prone to
misdiagnosis. Automating this process, especially seizure detection relying on
scalp-based Electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial EEG, has been the
focus of research over recent decades. Nevertheless, its numerous challenges
have inhibited a definitive solution. Inspired by recent advances in deep
learning, we propose a new classification approach for EEG time series based on
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) via the use of Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)
networks. The proposed deep network effectively learns and models
discriminative temporal patterns from EEG sequential data. Especially, the
features are automatically discovered from the raw EEG data without any
pre-processing step, eliminating humans from laborious feature design task. We
also show that, in the epilepsy scenario, simple architectures can achieve
competitive performance. Using simple architectures significantly benefits in
the practical scenario considering their low computation complexity and reduced
requirement for large training datasets. Using a public dataset, a multi-fold
cross-validation scheme exhibited an average validation accuracy of 95.54\% and
an average AUC of 0.9582 of the ROC curve among all sets defined in the
experiment. This work reinforces the benefits of deep learning to be further
attended in clinical applications and neuroscientific research.
