Pavlov's dog associative learning demonstrated on synaptic-like organic
  transistors
In this letter, we present an original demonstration of an associative
learning neural network inspired by the famous Pavlov's dogs experiment. A
single nanoparticle organic memory field effect transistor (NOMFET) is used to
implement each synapse. We show how the physical properties of this dynamic
memristive device can be used to perform low power write operations for the
learning and implement short-term association using temporal coding and spike
timing dependent plasticity based learning. An electronic circuit was built to
validate the proposed learning scheme with packaged devices, with good
reproducibility despite the complex synaptic-like dynamic of the NOMFET in
pulse regime.
