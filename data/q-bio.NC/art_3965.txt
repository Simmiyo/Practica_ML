Synchronous bursts on scale-free neuronal networks with attractive and
  repulsive coupling
This paper investigates the dependence of synchronization transitions of
bursting oscillations on the information transmission delay over scale-free
neuronal networks with attractive and repulsive coupling. It is shown that for
both types of coupling, the delay always plays a subtle role in either
promoting or impairing synchronization. In particular, depending on the
inherent oscillation period of individual neurons, regions of irregular and
regular propagating excitatory fronts appear intermittently as the delay
increases. These delay-induced synchronization transitions are manifested as
well-expressed minima in the measure for spatiotemporal synchrony. For
attractive coupling, the minima appear at every integer multiple of the average
oscillation period, while for the repulsive coupling, they appear at every odd
multiple of the half of the average oscillation period. The obtained results
are robust to the variations of the dynamics of individual neurons, the system
size, and the neuronal firing type. Hence, they can be used to characterize
attractively or repulsively coupled scale-free neuronal networks with delays.
