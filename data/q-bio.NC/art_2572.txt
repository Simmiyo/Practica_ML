Images from the Mind: BCI image evolution based on Rapid Serial Visual
  Presentation of polygon primitives
This paper provides a proof of concept for an EEG-based reconstruction of a
visual image which is on a user's mind. Our approach is based on the Rapid
Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) of polygon primitives and Brain-Computer
Interface (BCI) technology. The presentation of polygons that contribute to
build a target image (because they match the shape and/or color of the target)
trigger attention-related EEG patterns. Accordingly, these target primitives
can be determined using BCI classification of Event-Related Potentials (ERPs).
They are then accumulated in the display until a satisfactory reconstruction is
reached. Selection steps have an average classification accuracy of $75\%$.
$25\%$ of the images could be reconstructed completely, while more than $65\%$
of the available visual details could be captured on average. Most of the
misclassifications were not misinterpretations of the BCI concerning users'
intent; rather, users tried to select polygons that were different than what
was intended by the experimenters. Open problems and alternatives to develop a
practical BCI-based image reconstruction application are discussed.
