Musical NeuroPicks: a consumer-grade BCI for on-demand music streaming
  services
We investigated the possibility of using a machine-learning scheme in
conjunction with commercial wearable EEG-devices for translating listener's
subjective experience of music into scores that can be used in popular
on-demand music streaming services. Our study resulted into two variants,
differing in terms of performance and execution time, and hence, subserving
distinct applications in online streaming music platforms. The first method,
NeuroPicks, is extremely accurate but slower. It is based on the
well-established neuroscientific concepts of brainwave frequency bands,
activation asymmetry index and cross frequency coupling (CFC). The second
method, NeuroPicksVQ, offers prompt predictions of lower credibility and relies
on a custom-built version of vector quantization procedure that facilitates a
novel parameterization of the music-modulated brainwaves. Beyond the feature
engineering step, both methods exploit the inherent efficiency of extreme
learning machines (ELMs) so as to translate, in a personalized fashion, the
derived patterns into a listener's score. NeuroPicks method may find
applications as an integral part of contemporary music recommendation systems,
while NeuroPicksVQ can control the selection of music tracks. Encouraging
experimental results, from a pragmatic use of the systems, are presented.
