Automatic Localization of Deep Stimulation Electrodes Using
  Trajectory-based Segmentation Approach
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative condition of the nervous system,
which manifests itself primarily as muscle stiffness, hypokinesia,
bradykinesia, and tremor. In patients suffering from advanced stages of PD,
Deep Brain Stimulation neurosurgery (DBS) is the best alternative to medical
treatment, especially when they become tolerant to the drugs. This surgery
produces a neuronal activity, a result from electrical stimulation, whose
quantification is known as Volume of Tissue Activated (VTA). To locate
correctly the VTA in the cerebral volume space, one should be aware exactly the
location of the tip of the DBS electrodes, as well as their spatial projection.
  In this paper, we automatically locate DBS electrodes using a threshold-based
medical imaging segmentation methodology, determining the optimal value of this
threshold adaptively. The proposed methodology allows the localization of DBS
electrodes in Computed Tomography (CT) images, with high noise tolerance, using
automatic threshold detection methods.
