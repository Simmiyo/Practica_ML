Fundamental activity constraints lead to specific interpretations of the
  connectome
The continuous integration of experimental data into coherent models of the
brain is an increasing challenge of modern neuroscience. Such models provide a
bridge between structure and activity, and identify the mechanisms giving rise
to experimental observations. Nevertheless, structurally realistic network
models of spiking neurons are necessarily underconstrained even if experimental
data on brain connectivity are incorporated to the best of our knowledge.
Guided by physiological observations, any model must therefore explore the
parameter ranges within the uncertainty of the data. Based on simulation
results alone, however, the mechanisms underlying stable and physiologically
realistic activity often remain obscure. We here employ a mean-field reduction
of the dynamics, which allows us to include activity constraints into the
process of model construction. We shape the phase space of a multi-scale
network model of the vision-related areas of macaque cortex by systematically
refining its connectivity. Fundamental constraints on the activity, i.e.,
prohibiting quiescence and requiring global stability, prove sufficient to
obtain realistic layer- and area-specific activity. Only small adaptations of
the structure are required, showing that the network operates close to an
instability. The procedure identifies components of the network critical to its
collective dynamics and creates hypotheses for structural data and future
experiments. The method can be applied to networks involving any neuron model
with a known gain function.
