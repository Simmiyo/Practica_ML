Physical limits to magnetogenetics
This is an analysis of how magnetic fields affect biological molecules and
cells. It was prompted by a series of prominent reports regarding magnetism in
biological systems. The first claims to have identified a protein complex that
acts like a compass needle to guide magnetic orientation in animals (Qin et
al., 2016). Two other articles report magnetic control of membrane conductance
by attaching ferritin to an ion channel protein and then tugging the ferritin
or heating it with a magnetic field (Stanley et al., 2015; Wheeler et al.,
2016). Here I argue that these claims conflict with basic laws of physics. The
discrepancies are large: from 5 to 10 log units. If the reported phenomena do
in fact occur, they must have causes entirely different from the ones proposed
by the authors. The paramagnetic nature of protein complexes is found to
seriously limit their utility for engineering magnetically sensitive cells.
