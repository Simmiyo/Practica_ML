Systems biology: From the cell to the brain
With the completion of human genome mapping, the focus of scientists seeking
to explain the biological complexity of living systems is shifting from
analyzing the individual components (such as a particular gene or biochemical
reaction) to understanding the set of interactions amongst the large number of
components that results in the different functions of the organism. To this
end, the area of systems biology attempts to achieve a "systems-level"
description of biology by focusing on the network of interactions instead of
the characteristics of its isolated parts. In this article, we briefly describe
some of the emerging themes of research in "network" biology, looking at
dynamical processes occurring at the two different length scales of within the
cell and between cells, viz., the intra-cellular signaling network and the
nervous system. We show that focusing on the systems-level aspects of these
problems allows one to observe surprising and illuminating common themes
amongst them.
