Network structure determines patterns of network reorganization during
  adult neurogenesis
New cells are generated throughout life and integrate into the hippocampus
via the process of adult neurogenesis. Epileptogenic brain injury induces many
structural changes in the hippocampus, including the death of interneurons and
altered connectivity patterns. The pathological neurogenic niche is associated
with aberrant neurogenesis, though the role of the network-level changes in
development of epilepsy is not well understood. In this paper, we use
computational simulations to investigate the effect of network environment on
structural and functional outcomes of neurogenesis. We find that small-world
networks with external stimulus are able to be augmented by activity-seeking
neurons in a manner that enhances activity at the stimulated sites without
altering the network as a whole. However, when inhibition is decreased or
connectivity patterns are changed, new cells are both less responsive to
stimulus and the new cells are more likely to drive the network into bursting
dynamics. Our results suggest that network-level changes caused by
epileptogenic injury can create an environment where neurogenic reorganization
can induce or intensify epileptic dynamics and abnormal integration of new
cells.
