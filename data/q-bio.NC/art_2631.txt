Sensitivity Analysis for additive STDP rule
Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) is a Hebbian like synaptic learning
rule. The basis of STDP has strong experimental evidences and it depends on
precise input and output spike timings. In this paper we show that under
biologically plausible spiking regime, slight variability in the spike timing
leads to drastically different evolution of synaptic weights when its dynamics
are governed by the additive STDP rule.
