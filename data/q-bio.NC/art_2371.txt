Multi-command Tactile Brain Computer Interface: A Feasibility Study
The study presented explores the extent to which tactile stimuli delivered to
the ten digits of a BCI-naive subject can serve as a platform for a brain
computer interface (BCI) that could be used in an interactive application such
as robotic vehicle operation. The ten fingertips are used to evoke
somatosensory brain responses, thus defining a tactile brain computer interface
(tBCI). Experimental results on subjects performing online (real-time) tBCI,
using stimuli with a moderately fast inter-stimulus-interval (ISI), provide a
validation of the tBCI prototype, while the feasibility of the concept is
illuminated through information-transfer rates obtained through the case study.
