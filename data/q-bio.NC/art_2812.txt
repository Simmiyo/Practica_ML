A neuro-mathematical model for geometrical optical illusions
Geometrical optical illusions have been object of many studies due to the
possibility they offer to understand the behaviour of low-level visual
processing. They consist in situations in which the perceived geometrical
properties of an object differ from those of the object in the visual stimulus.
Starting from the geometrical model introduced by Citti and Sarti in [3], we
provide a mathematical model and a computational algorithm which allows to
interpret these phenomena and to qualitatively reproduce the perceived
misperception.
