Effect of the duration of the synaptic activity on a delayed recurrent
  neuronal loop
A recurrent loop consisting of a single neuron is considered which is
influenced by a chemical excitatory delayed synaptic feedback. We show the
response of the system is dependent to the duration of the activity of the
synapse which is determined by the deactivation time constant of the synapse.
We show that loops with slow synapses, those which the effect of the synaptic
activation remains for time constants comparable to the period of firing, show
more predictable results where the effect of the fast synapses is tightly
dependent on the loop delay time. The results are compared to those of the
loops with inhibitory synapses and also with electrical synapses.
