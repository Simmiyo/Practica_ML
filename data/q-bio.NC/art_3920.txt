Entropy analyses of spatiotemporal synchronizations in brain signals
  from patients with focal epilepsies
The electroencephalographic (EEG) data intracerebrally recorded from 20
epileptic humans with different brain origins of focal epilepsies or types of
seizures, ages and sexes are investigated (nearly 700 million data). Multi
channel univariate amplitude analyses are performed and it is shown that time
dependent Shannon entropies can be used to predict focal epileptic seizure
onsets in different epileptogenic brain zones of different patients. Formations
or time evolutions of the synchronizations in the brain signals from
epileptogenic or non epileptogenic areas of the patients in ictal interval or
inter-ictal interval are further investigated employing spatial or temporal
differences of the entropies.
