Affordances and Safe Design of Assistance Wearable Virtual Environment
  of Gesture
Safety and reliability are the main issues for designing assistance wearable
virtual environment of technical gesture in aerospace, or health application
domains. That needs the integration in the same isomorphic engineering
framework of human requirements, systems requirements and the rationale of
their relation to the natural and artifactual environment.To explore coupling
integration and design functional organization of support technical gesture
systems, firstly ecological psychologyprovides usa heuristicconcept: the
affordance. On the other hand mathematical theory of integrative physiology
provides us scientific concepts: the stabilizing auto-association principle and
functional interaction.After demonstrating the epistemological consistence of
these concepts, we define an isomorphic framework to describe and model human
systems integration dedicated to human in-the-loop system engineering.We
present an experimental approach of safe design of assistance wearable virtual
environment of gesture based in laboratory and parabolic flights. On the
results, we discuss the relevance of our conceptual approach and the
applications to future assistance of gesture wearable systems engineering.
