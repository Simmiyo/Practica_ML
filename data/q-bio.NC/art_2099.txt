To which extent is the membrane potential in a neuron between successive
  spikes adequately modelled by a (continuous) semimartingale?
We consider $p$-variations in some membrane potential data --viewed as a
function of the step size in case where $p$ is fixed, or viewed as a function
of $p$ in case where the step size is fixed-- and compare their shape with
results in Ait-Sahalia and Jacod (2009) which do hold for general
semimartingales. We obtain the following conclusion: in non- or very rarely
spiking cases the membrane potential behaves as a semimartingale, in some cases
as a semimartingale with jumps. Once the neuron is spiking, a semimartingale
modelization is no longer adequate for the membrane potential between
successive spikes, even if interspike intervals are relatively long.
