Neural networks with excitatory and inhibitory components: direct and
  inverse problems by a mean-field approach
We study the dynamics of networks with inhibitory and excitatory
leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons with short-term synaptic plasticity in the
presence of depressive and facilitating mechanisms. The dynamics is analyzed by
a Heterogeneous Mean-Field approximation, that allows to keep track of the
effects of structural disorder in the network. We describe the complex behavior
of different classes of excitatory and inhibitory components, that give rise to
a rich dynamical phase-diagram as a function of the fraction of inhibitory
neurons. By the same mean field approach, we study and solve a global inverse
problem: reconstructing the degree probability distributions of the inhibitory
and excitatory components and the fraction of inhibitory neurons from the
knowledge of the average synaptic activity field. This approach unveils new
perspectives in the numerical study of neural network dynamics and in the
possibility of using these models as testbed for the analysis of experimental
data.
