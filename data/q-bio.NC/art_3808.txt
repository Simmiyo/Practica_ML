Self-Sustained Thought Processes in a Dense Associative Network
Several guiding principles for thought processes are proposed and a
neural-network-type model implementing these principles is presented and
studied. We suggest to consider thinking within an associative network built-up
of overlapping memory states. We consider a homogeneous associative network as
biological considerations rule out distinct conjunction units between the
information (the memories) stored in the brain. We therefore propose that
memory states have a dual functionality: They represent on one side the stored
information and serve, on the other side, as the associative links in between
the different dynamical states of the network which consists of transient
attractors.
  We implement these principles within a generalized winners-take-all neural
network with sparse coding and an additional coupling to local reservoirs. We
show that this network is capable to generate autonomously a self-sustained
time-series of memory states which we identify with a thought process. Each
memory state is associatively connected with its predecessor.
  This system shows several emerging features, it is able (a) to recognize
external patterns in a noisy background, (b) to focus attention autonomously
and (c) to represent hierarchical memory states with an internal structure.
