Normative theory of visual receptive fields
This article gives an overview of a normative computational theory of visual
receptive fields, by which idealized functional models of early spatial,
spatio-chromatic and spatio-temporal receptive fields can be derived in an
axiomatic way based on structural properties of the environment in combination
with assumptions about the internal structure of a vision system to guarantee
consistent handling of image representations over multiple spatial and temporal
scales. Interestingly, this theory leads to predictions about visual receptive
field shapes with qualitatively very good similarity to biological receptive
fields measured in the retina, the LGN and the primary visual cortex (V1) of
mammals.
