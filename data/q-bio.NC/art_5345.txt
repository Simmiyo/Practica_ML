Reconstructing Speech Stimuli From Human Auditory Cortex Activity Using
  a WaveNet Approach
The superior temporal gyrus (STG) region of cortex critically contributes to
speech recognition. In this work, we show that a proposed WaveNet, with limited
available data, is able to reconstruct speech stimuli from STG intracranial
recordings. We further investigate the impulse response of the fitted model for
each recording electrode and observe phoneme level temporospectral tuning
properties for the recorded area of cortex. This discovery is consistent with
previous studies implicating the posterior STG (pSTG) in a phonetic
representation of speech and provides detailed acoustic features that certain
electrode sites possibly extract during speech recognition.
