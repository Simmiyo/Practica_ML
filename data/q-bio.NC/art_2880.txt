Multicommand Tactile Brain Computer Interface based on Fingertips or
  Head Stimulation
The paper presents results from a computational neuroscience study conducted
to test vibrotactile stimuli delivered to subject fingertips and head areas in
order to evoke the somatosensory brain responses utilized in a haptic brain
computer interface (hBCI) paradigm. We present the preliminary and very
encouraging results, with subjects conducting online hBCI interfacing
experiments, ranging from 40% to 90% with a very fast inter-stimulus-interval
(ISI) of 250ms. The presented results confirm our hypothesis that the hBCI
paradigm concept is valid and it allows for rapid stimuli presentation in order
to achieve a satisfactory information-transfer-rate of the novel BCI.
