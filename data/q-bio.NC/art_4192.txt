Spin Neurons: A Possible Path to Energy-Efficient Neuromorphic Computers
Recent years have witnessed growing interest in the field of brain-inspired
computing based on neural-network architectures. In order to translate the
related algorithmic models into powerful, yet energy-efficient
cognitive-computing hardware, computing-devices beyond CMOS may need to be
explored. The suitability of such devices to this field of computing would
strongly depend upon how closely their physical characteristics match with the
essential computing primitives employed in such models. In this work we discuss
the rationale of applying emerging spin-torque devices for bio-inspired
computing. Recent spin-torque experiments have shown the path to low-current,
low-voltage and high-speed magnetization switching in nano-scale magnetic
devices. Such magneto-metallic, current-mode spin-torque switches can mimic the
analog summing and thresholding operation of an artificial neuron with high
energy-efficiency. Comparison with CMOS-based analog circuit-model of neuron
shows that spin neurons can achieve more than two orders of magnitude lower
energy and beyond three orders of magnitude reduction in energy-delay product.
The application of spin neurons can therefore be an attractive option for
neuromorphic computers of future.
