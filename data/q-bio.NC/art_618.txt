An adapting auditory-motor feedback loop can contribute to generating
  vocal repetition
Consecutive repetition of actions is common in behavioral sequences. Although
integration of sensory feedback with internal motor programs is important for
sequence generation, if and how feedback contributes to repetitive actions is
poorly understood. Here we study how auditory feedback contributes to
generating repetitive syllable sequences in songbirds. We propose that auditory
signals provide positive feedback to ongoing motor commands, but this influence
decays as feedback weakens from response adaptation during syllable
repetitions. Computational models show that this mechanism explains repeat
distributions observed in Bengalese finch song. We experimentally confirmed two
predictions of this mechanism in Bengalese finches: removal of auditory
feedback by deafening reduces syllable repetitions; and neural responses to
auditory playback of repeated syllable sequences gradually adapt in
sensory-motor nucleus HVC. Together, our results implicate a positive
auditory-feedback loop with adaptation in generating repetitive vocalizations,
and suggest sensory adaptation is important for feedback control of motor
sequences.
