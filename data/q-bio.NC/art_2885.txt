Optimal measurement of visual motion across spatial and temporal scales
Sensory systems use limited resources to mediate the perception of a great
variety of objects and events. Here a normative framework is presented for
exploring how the problem of efficient allocation of resources can be solved in
visual perception. Starting with a basic property of every measurement,
captured by Gabor's uncertainty relation about the location and frequency
content of signals, prescriptions are developed for optimal allocation of
sensors for reliable perception of visual motion. This study reveals that a
large-scale characteristic of human vision (the spatiotemporal contrast
sensitivity function) is similar to the optimal prescription, and it suggests
that some previously puzzling phenomena of visual sensitivity, adaptation, and
perceptual organization have simple principled explanations.
