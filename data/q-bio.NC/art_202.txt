Adaptive self-organization in a realistic neural network model
Information processing in complex systems is often found to be maximally
efficient close to critical states associated with phase transitions. It is
therefore conceivable that also neural information processing operates close to
criticality. This is further supported by the observation of power-law
distributions, which are a hallmark of phase transitions. An important open
question is how neural networks could remain close to a critical point while
undergoing a continual change in the course of development, adaptation,
learning, and more. An influential contribution was made by Bornholdt and
Rohlf, introducing a generic mechanism of robust self-organized criticality in
adaptive networks. Here, we address the question whether this mechanism is
relevant for real neural networks. We show in a realistic model that
spike-time-dependent synaptic plasticity can self-organize neural networks
robustly toward criticality. Our model reproduces several empirical
observations and makes testable predictions on the distribution of synaptic
strength, relating them to the critical state of the network. These results
suggest that the interplay between dynamics and topology may be essential for
neural information processing.
