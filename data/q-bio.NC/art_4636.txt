Dopamine modulation of prefrontal delay activity-reverberatory activity
  and sharpness of tuning curves
Recent electrophysiological experiments have shown that dopamine (D1)
modulation of pyramidal cells in prefrontal cortex reduces spike frequency
adaptation and enhances NMDA transmission. Using four models, from
multicompartmental to integrate and fire, we examine the effects of these
modulations on sustained (delay) activity in a reverberatory network. We find
that D1 modulation may enable robust network bistability yielding selective
reverberation among cells that code for a particular item or location. We
further show that the tuning curve of such cells is sharpened, and that
signal-to-noise ratio is increased. We postulate that D1 modulation affects the
tuning of "memory fields" and yield efficient distributed dynamic
representations.
