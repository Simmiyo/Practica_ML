Experience-driven formation of parts-based representations in a model of
  layered visual memory
Growing neuropsychological and neurophysiological evidence suggests that the
visual cortex uses parts-based representations to encode, store and retrieve
relevant objects. In such a scheme, objects are represented as a set of
spatially distributed local features, or parts, arranged in stereotypical
fashion. To encode the local appearance and to represent the relations between
the constituent parts, there has to be an appropriate memory structure formed
by previous experience with visual objects. Here, we propose a model how a
hierarchical memory structure supporting efficient storage and rapid recall of
parts-based representations can be established by an experience-driven process
of self-organization. The process is based on the collaboration of slow
bidirectional synaptic plasticity and homeostatic unit activity regulation,
both running at the top of fast activity dynamics with winner-take-all
character modulated by an oscillatory rhythm. These neural mechanisms lay down
the basis for cooperation and competition between the distributed units and
their synaptic connections. Choosing human face recognition as a test task, we
show that, under the condition of open-ended, unsupervised incremental
learning, the system is able to form memory traces for individual faces in a
parts-based fashion. On a lower memory layer the synaptic structure is
developed to represent local facial features and their interrelations, while
the identities of different persons are captured explicitly on a higher layer.
An additional property of the resulting representations is the sparseness of
both the activity during the recall and the synaptic patterns comprising the
memory traces.
