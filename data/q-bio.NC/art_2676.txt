Energy-efficient neuromorphic classifiers
Neuromorphic engineering combines the architectural and computational
principles of systems neuroscience with semiconductor electronics, with the aim
of building efficient and compact devices that mimic the synaptic and neural
machinery of the brain. Neuromorphic engineering promises extremely low energy
consumptions, comparable to those of the nervous system. However, until now the
neuromorphic approach has been restricted to relatively simple circuits and
specialized functions, rendering elusive a direct comparison of their energy
consumption to that used by conventional von Neumann digital machines solving
real-world tasks. Here we show that a recent technology developed by IBM can be
leveraged to realize neuromorphic circuits that operate as classifiers of
complex real-world stimuli. These circuits emulate enough neurons to compete
with state-of-the-art classifiers. We also show that the energy consumption of
the IBM chip is typically 2 or more orders of magnitude lower than that of
conventional digital machines when implementing classifiers with comparable
performance. Moreover, the spike-based dynamics display a trade-off between
integration time and accuracy, which naturally translates into algorithms that
can be flexibly deployed for either fast and approximate classifications, or
more accurate classifications at the mere expense of longer running times and
higher energy costs. This work finally proves that the neuromorphic approach
can be efficiently used in real-world applications and it has significant
advantages over conventional digital devices when energy consumption is
considered.
