Cerebral Signal Instantaneous Parameters Estimation MATLAB Toolbox -
  User Guide Version 2.3
This document is meant to help individuals use the Cerebral Signal Phase
Analysis toolbox which implements different methods for estimating the
instantaneous phase and frequency of a signal and calculating some related
popular quantities.The toolbox -- which is distributed under the terms of the
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE as a set of MATLAB routines -- can be downloaded at
the address http://oset.ir/category.php?dir=Tools.The purpose of this toolbox
is to calculate the instantaneous phase and frequency sequences of cerebral
signals (EEG, MEG, etc.) and some related popular features and quantities in
brain studies and Neuroscience such as Phase Shift, Phase Resetting, Phase
Locking Value (PLV), Phase Difference and more, to help researchers in these
fields.
