Cliques and Cavities in the Human Connectome
Encoding brain regions and their connections as a network of nodes and edges
captures many of the possible paths along which information can be transmitted
as humans process and perform complex behaviors. Because cognitive processes
involve large and distributed networks of brain areas, examinations of
multi-node routes within larger connection patterns can offer fundamental
insights into the complexities of brain function. Here, we investigate both
densely connected groups of nodes that could perform local computations as well
as larger patterns of interactions that would allow for parallel processing.
Finding such structures necessitates we move from considering pairwise
interactions to capturing higher order relations, concepts naturally expressed
in the language of algebraic topology. These tools can be used to study
mesoscale structures arising from the arrangement of densely connected
substructures called cliques in otherwise sparsely connected brain networks. We
detect cliques (all-to-all connected sets of brain regions) in the average
structural connectomes of 8 healthy adults and discover the presence of more
large cliques than expected in null networks constructed via wiring
minimization, providing architecture through which brain network can perform
rapid, local processing. We then locate topological cavities of different
dimensions, around which information may flow in either diverging or converging
patterns. These cavities exist consistently across subjects, differ from those
observed in null model networks, and link regions of early and late
evolutionary origin in long loops, underscoring their unique role in
controlling brain function. These results offer a first demonstration that
techniques from algebraic topology offer a novel perspective on structural
connectomics, highlighting loop-like paths as crucial features in the human
brain's structural architecture.
