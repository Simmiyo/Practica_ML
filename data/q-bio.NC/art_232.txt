Sparse incomplete representations: A novel role for olfactory granule
  cells
Mitral cells of the olfactory bulb form sparse representations of the
odorants and transmit this information to the cortex. The olfactory code
carried by the mitral cells is sparser than the inputs that they receive. In
this study we analyze the mechanisms and functional significance of sparse
olfactory codes. We consider a model of olfactory bulb containing populations
of excitatory mitral and inhibitory granule cells. We argue that sparse codes
may emerge as a result of self organization in the network leading to the
precise balance between mitral cells' excitatory inputs and inhibition provided
by the granule cells. We propose a novel role for the olfactory granule cells.
We show that these cells can build representations of odorant stimuli that are
not fully accurate. Due to the incompleteness in the granule cell
representation, the exact excitation-inhibition balance is established only for
some mitral cells leading to sparse responses of the mitral cell. Our model
suggests a functional significance to the dendrodendritic synapses that mediate
interactions between mitral and granule cells. The model accounts for the
sparse olfactory code in the steady state and predicts that transient dynamics
may be less sparse.
