A Discontinuous Neural Network for Non-Negative Sparse Approximation
This paper investigates a discontinuous neural network which is used as a
model of the mammalian olfactory system and can more generally be applied to
solve non-negative sparse approximation problems. By inherently limiting the
systems integrators to having non-negative outputs, the system function becomes
discontinuous since the integrators switch between being inactive and being
active. It is shown that the presented network converges to equilibrium points
which are solutions to general non-negative least squares optimization
problems. We specify a Caratheodory solution and prove that the network is
stable, provided that the system matrix has full column-rank. Under a mild
condition on the equilibrium point, we show that the network converges to its
equilibrium within a finite number of switches. Two applications of the neural
network are shown. Firstly, we apply the network as a model of the olfactory
system and show that in principle it may be capable of performing complex
sparse signal recovery tasks. Secondly, we generalize the application to
include non-negative sparse approximation problems and compare the recovery
performance to a classical non-negative basis pursuit denoising algorithm. We
conclude that the recovery performance differs only marginally from the
classical algorithm, while the neural network has the advantage that no
performance critical regularization parameter has to be chosen prior to
recovery.
