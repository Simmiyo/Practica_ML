Auditory Brain-Computer Interface Paradigm with Head Related Impulse
  Response-based Spatial Cues
The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive test of head related
impulse response (HRIR) for an auditory spatial speller brain-computer
interface (BCI) paradigm. The study is conducted with six users in an
experimental set up based on five Japanese hiragana vowels. Auditory evoked
potentials resulted with encouragingly good and stable "aha-" or P300-responses
in real-world online BCI experiments. Our case study indicated that the
auditory HRIR spatial sound reproduction paradigm could be a viable alternative
to the established multi-loudspeaker surround sound BCI-speller applications,
as far as healthy pilot study users are concerned.
