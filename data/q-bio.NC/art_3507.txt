Time irreversibility and its application in epileptic brain electrical
  activities
Time irreversibility (temporal asymmetry) is one of fundamental properties
that characterize the nonlinearity of complex dynamical processes, and our
brain is a typical complex dynamical system manifested with nonlinearity. Two
subtraction-based parameters, Ys and X2, are employed to measure the
probabilistic differences of permutations instead of raw vectors for the
simplified quantification of time irreversibility, which is validated by
chaotic and reversible processes and the surrogate data. We show that it is
equivalent to quantify time irreversibility by measuring probabilistic
difference between the forward and its backward processes and between the
symmetric permutations. And we detect time irreversibility of two groups of
epileptic EEGs, from the Nanjing General Hospital (NJGH) and from the public
Bonn epileptic database. In our contribution, the manifestation of nonlinearity
of whether healthy or diseased brain electrical activities is highlighted, and
the highest time irreversibility of epileptic EEG during seizures is
demonstrated. NJGH epileptic EEGs during seizure-free intervals of have lower
time irreversibility than the control data while those of the Bonn data sets
have higher nonlinearity than the healthy brain electrical activities. For the
inconsistent results, we conduct multi-scale analysis and elucidate from the
circadian rhythms in epileptic nonlinearity, however, more targeted researches
are needed to verify our assumptions or to determine if there are other reasons
leading to the inconsistency.
