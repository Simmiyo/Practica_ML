$\infty-$Dimensional Cerebellar Controller for Realistic Human
  Biodynamics
In this paper we propose an $\infty-$dimensional cerebellar model of neural
controller for realistic human biodynamics. The model is developed using
Feynman's action-amplitude (partition function) formalism. The cerebellum
controller is acting as a supervisor for an autogenetic servo control of human
musculo-skeletal dynamics, which is presented in (dissipative, driven)
Hamiltonian form. The $\infty-$dimensional cerebellar controller is closely
related to entropic motor control.
