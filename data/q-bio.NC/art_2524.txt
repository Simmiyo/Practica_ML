Racing to Learn: Statistical Inference and Learning in a Single Spiking
  Neuron with Adaptive Kernels
This paper describes the Synapto-dendritic Kernel Adapting Neuron (SKAN), a
simple spiking neuron model that performs statistical inference and
unsupervised learning of spatiotemporal spike patterns. SKAN is the first
proposed neuron model to investigate the effects of dynamic synapto-dendritic
kernels and demonstrate their computational power even at the single neuron
scale. The rule-set defining the neuron is simple there are no complex
mathematical operations such as normalization, exponentiation or even
multiplication. The functionalities of SKAN emerge from the real-time
interaction of simple additive and binary processes. Like a biological neuron,
SKAN is robust to signal and parameter noise, and can utilize both in its
operations. At the network scale neurons are locked in a race with each other
with the fastest neuron to spike effectively hiding its learnt pattern from its
neighbors. The robustness to noise, high speed and simple building blocks not
only make SKAN an interesting neuron model in computational neuroscience, but
also make it ideal for implementation in digital and analog neuromorphic
systems which is demonstrated through an implementation in a Field Programmable
Gate Array (FPGA).
