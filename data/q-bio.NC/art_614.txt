Relation between firing statistics of spiking neuron with instantaneous
  feedback and without feedback
We consider a wide class of spiking neuron models, defined by rather general
set of conditions typical for basic models like leaky integrate and fire, or
binding neuron model. A neuron is fed with a point renewal process. A relation
between the three probability density functions (pdf): (i) pdf of input
interspike intervals, (ii) pdf of output interspike intervals of a neuron with
instantaneous feedback and (iii) pdf for that same neuron without feedback is
derived. This allows to calculate any of the three pdfs provided the another
two are given. Similar relation between corresponding means and variances is
derived. The relations are checked exactly for the binding neuron model.
