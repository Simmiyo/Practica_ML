Influence of firing mechanisms on gain modulation
We studied the impact of a dynamical threshold on the f-I curve-the
relationship between the input and the firing rate of a neuron-in the presence
of background synaptic inputs. First, we found that, while the leaky
integrate-and-fire model cannot reproduce the f-I curve of a cortical neuron,
the leaky integrate-and-fire model with dynamical threshold can reproduce it
very well. Second, we found that the dynamical threshold modulates the onset
and the asymptotic behavior of the f-I curve. These results suggest that a
cortical neuron has an adaptation mechanism and that the dynamical threshold
has some significance for the computational properties of a neuron.
