Exact computation of the Maximum Entropy Potential of spiking neural
  networks models
Understanding how stimuli and synaptic connectivity in uence the statistics
of spike patterns in neural networks is a central question in computational
neuroscience. Maximum Entropy approach has been successfully used to
characterize the statistical response of simultaneously recorded spiking
neurons responding to stimuli. But, in spite of good performance in terms of
prediction, the fitting parameters do not explain the underlying mechanistic
causes of the observed correlations. On the other hand, mathematical models of
spiking neurons (neuro-mimetic models) provide a probabilistic mapping between
stimulus, network architecture and spike patterns in terms of conditional
proba- bilities. In this paper we build an exact analytical mapping between
neuro-mimetic and Maximum Entropy models.
