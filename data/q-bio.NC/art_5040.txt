Rhythm Zone Theory: Speech Rhythms are Physical after all
Speech rhythms have been dealt with in three main ways: from the
introspective analyses of rhythm as a correlate of syllable and foot timing in
linguistics and applied linguistics, through analyses of durations of segments
of utterances associated with consonantal and vocalic properties, syllables,
feet and words, to models of rhythms in speech production and perception as
physical oscillations. The present study avoids introspection and
human-filtered annotation methods and extends the signal processing paradigm of
amplitude envelope spectrum analysis by adding an additional analytic step of
edge detection, and postulating the co-existence of multiple speech rhythms in
rhythm zones marked by identifiable edges (Rhythm Zone Theory, RZT). An
exploratory investigation of the utility of RZT is conducted, suggesting that
native and non-native readings of the same text are distinct sub-genres of read
speech: a reading by a US native speaker and non-native readings by relatively
low-performing Cantonese adult learners of English. The study concludes by
noting that with the methods used, RZT can distinguish between the speech
rhythms of well-defined sub-genres of native speaker reading vs. non-native
learner reading, but needs further refinement in order to be applied to the
paradoxically more complex speech of low-performing language learners, whose
speech rhythms are co-determined by non-fluency and disfluency factors in
addition to well-known linguistic factors of grammar, vocabulary and discourse
constraints.
