Adaptive Stochastic Primal-Dual Coordinate Descent for Separable Saddle
  Point Problems
We consider a generic convex-concave saddle point problem with separable
structure, a form that covers a wide-ranged machine learning applications.
Under this problem structure, we follow the framework of primal-dual updates
for saddle point problems, and incorporate stochastic block coordinate descent
with adaptive stepsize into this framework. We theoretically show that our
proposal of adaptive stepsize potentially achieves a sharper linear convergence
rate compared with the existing methods. Additionally, since we can select
"mini-batch" of block coordinates to update, our method is also amenable to
parallel processing for large-scale data. We apply the proposed method to
regularized empirical risk minimization and show that it performs comparably
or, more often, better than state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and
real-world data sets.
