Power System Parameters Forecasting Using Hilbert-Huang Transform and
  Machine Learning
A novel hybrid data-driven approach is developed for forecasting power system
parameters with the goal of increasing the efficiency of short-term forecasting
studies for non-stationary time-series. The proposed approach is based on mode
decomposition and a feature analysis of initial retrospective data using the
Hilbert-Huang transform and machine learning algorithms. The random forests and
gradient boosting trees learning techniques were examined. The decision tree
techniques were used to rank the importance of variables employed in the
forecasting models. The Mean Decrease Gini index is employed as an impurity
function. The resulting hybrid forecasting models employ the radial basis
function neural network and support vector regression. Apart from introduction
and references the paper is organized as follows. The section 2 presents the
background and the review of several approaches for short-term forecasting of
power system parameters. In the third section a hybrid machine learning-based
algorithm using Hilbert-Huang transform is developed for short-term forecasting
of power system parameters. Fourth section describes the decision tree learning
algorithms used for the issue of variables importance. Finally in section six
the experimental results in the following electric power problems are
presented: active power flow forecasting, electricity price forecasting and for
the wind speed and direction forecasting.
