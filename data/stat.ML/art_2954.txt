Quantum Annealing for Variational Bayes Inference
This paper presents studies on a deterministic annealing algorithm based on
quantum annealing for variational Bayes (QAVB) inference, which can be seen as
an extension of the simulated annealing for variational Bayes (SAVB) inference.
QAVB is as easy as SAVB to implement. Experiments revealed QAVB finds a better
local optimum than SAVB in terms of the variational free energy in latent
Dirichlet allocation (LDA).
