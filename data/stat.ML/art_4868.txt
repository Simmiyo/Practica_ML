Feature Extraction and Automated Classification of Heartbeats by Machine
  Learning
We present algorithms for the detection of a class of heart arrhythmias with
the goal of eventual adoption by practicing cardiologists. In clinical
practice, detection is based on a small number of meaningful features extracted
from the heartbeat cycle. However, techniques proposed in the literature use
high dimensional vectors consisting of morphological, and time based features
for detection. Using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, we found smaller subsets
of features sufficient to detect arrhythmias with high accuracy. The features
were found by an iterative step-wise feature selection method. We depart from
common literature in the following aspects: 1. As opposed to a high dimensional
feature vectors, we use a small set of features with meaningful clinical
interpretation, 2. we eliminate the necessity of short-duration
patient-specific ECG data to append to the global training data for
classification 3. We apply semi-parametric classification procedures (in an
ensemble framework) for arrhythmia detection, and 4. our approach is based on a
reduced sampling rate of ~ 115 Hz as opposed to 360 Hz in standard literature.
