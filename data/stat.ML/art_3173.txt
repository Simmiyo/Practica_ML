Efficient Blind Compressed Sensing Using Sparsifying Transforms with
  Convergence Guarantees and Application to MRI
Natural signals and images are well-known to be approximately sparse in
transform domains such as Wavelets and DCT. This property has been heavily
exploited in various applications in image processing and medical imaging.
Compressed sensing exploits the sparsity of images or image patches in a
transform domain or synthesis dictionary to reconstruct images from
undersampled measurements. In this work, we focus on blind compressed sensing,
where the underlying sparsifying transform is a priori unknown, and propose a
framework to simultaneously reconstruct the underlying image as well as the
sparsifying transform from highly undersampled measurements. The proposed block
coordinate descent type algorithms involve highly efficient optimal updates.
Importantly, we prove that although the proposed blind compressed sensing
formulations are highly nonconvex, our algorithms are globally convergent
(i.e., they converge from any initialization) to the set of critical points of
the objectives defining the formulations. These critical points are guaranteed
to be at least partial global and partial local minimizers. The exact point(s)
of convergence may depend on initialization. We illustrate the usefulness of
the proposed framework for magnetic resonance image reconstruction from highly
undersampled k-space measurements. As compared to previous methods involving
the synthesis dictionary model, our approach is much faster, while also
providing promising reconstruction quality.
