Parallel Implementation of Efficient Search Schemes for the Inference of
  Cancer Progression Models
The emergence and development of cancer is a consequence of the accumulation
over time of genomic mutations involving a specific set of genes, which
provides the cancer clones with a functional selective advantage. In this work,
we model the order of accumulation of such mutations during the progression,
which eventually leads to the disease, by means of probabilistic graphic
models, i.e., Bayesian Networks (BNs). We investigate how to perform the task
of learning the structure of such BNs, according to experimental evidence,
adopting a global optimization meta-heuristics. In particular, in this work we
rely on Genetic Algorithms, and to strongly reduce the execution time of the
inference -- which can also involve multiple repetitions to collect
statistically significant assessments of the data -- we distribute the
calculations using both multi-threading and a multi-node architecture. The
results show that our approach is characterized by good accuracy and
specificity; we also demonstrate its feasibility, thanks to a 84x reduction of
the overall execution time with respect to a traditional sequential
implementation.
