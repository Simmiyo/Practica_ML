Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation with Non-Parametric Copulas
A new framework based on the theory of copulas is proposed to address semi-
supervised domain adaptation problems. The presented method factorizes any
multivariate density into a product of marginal distributions and bivariate
cop- ula functions. Therefore, changes in each of these factors can be detected
and corrected to adapt a density model accross different learning domains.
Impor- tantly, we introduce a novel vine copula model, which allows for this
factorization in a non-parametric manner. Experimental results on regression
problems with real-world data illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach
when compared to state-of-the-art techniques.
