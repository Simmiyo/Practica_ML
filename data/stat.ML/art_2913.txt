Nonparametric Hierarchical Clustering of Functional Data
In this paper, we deal with the problem of curves clustering. We propose a
nonparametric method which partitions the curves into clusters and discretizes
the dimensions of the curve points into intervals. The cross-product of these
partitions forms a data-grid which is obtained using a Bayesian model selection
approach while making no assumptions regarding the curves. Finally, a
post-processing technique, aiming at reducing the number of clusters in order
to improve the interpretability of the clustering, is proposed. It consists in
optimally merging the clusters step by step, which corresponds to an
agglomerative hierarchical classification whose dissimilarity measure is the
variation of the criterion. Interestingly this measure is none other than the
sum of the Kullback-Leibler divergences between clusters distributions before
and after the merges. The practical interest of the approach for functional
data exploratory analysis is presented and compared with an alternative
approach on an artificial and a real world data set.
