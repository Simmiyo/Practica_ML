CUR Algorithm with Incomplete Matrix Observation
CUR matrix decomposition is a randomized algorithm that can efficiently
compute the low rank approximation for a given rectangle matrix. One limitation
with the existing CUR algorithms is that they require an access to the full
matrix A for computing U. In this work, we aim to alleviate this limitation. In
particular, we assume that besides having an access to randomly sampled d rows
and d columns from A, we only observe a subset of randomly sampled entries from
A. Our goal is to develop a low rank approximation algorithm, similar to CUR,
based on (i) randomly sampled rows and columns from A, and (ii) randomly
sampled entries from A. The proposed algorithm is able to perfectly recover the
target matrix A with only O(rn log n) number of observed entries. In addition,
instead of having to solve an optimization problem involved trace norm
regularization, the proposed algorithm only needs to solve a standard
regression problem. Finally, unlike most matrix completion theories that hold
only when the target matrix is of low rank, we show a strong guarantee for the
proposed algorithm even when the target matrix is not low rank.
