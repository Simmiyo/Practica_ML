Semantic Scan: Detecting Subtle, Spatially Localized Events in Text
  Streams
Early detection and precise characterization of emerging topics in text
streams can be highly useful in applications such as timely and targeted public
health interventions and discovering evolving regional business trends. Many
methods have been proposed for detecting emerging events in text streams using
topic modeling. However, these methods have numerous shortcomings that make
them unsuitable for rapid detection of locally emerging events on massive text
streams. In this paper, we describe Semantic Scan (SS) that has been developed
specifically to overcome these shortcomings in detecting new spatially compact
events in text streams.
  Semantic Scan integrates novel contrastive topic modeling with online
document assignment and principled likelihood ratio-based spatial scanning to
identify emerging events with unexpected patterns of keywords hidden in text
streams. This enables more timely and accurate detection and characterization
of anomalous, spatially localized emerging events. Semantic Scan does not
require manual intervention or labeled training data, and is robust to noise in
real-world text data since it identifies anomalous text patterns that occur in
a cluster of new documents rather than an anomaly in a single new document.
  We compare Semantic Scan to alternative state-of-the-art methods such as
Topics over Time, Online LDA, and Labeled LDA on two real-world tasks: (i) a
disease surveillance task monitoring free-text Emergency Department chief
complaints in Allegheny County, and (ii) an emerging business trend detection
task based on Yelp reviews. On both tasks, we find that Semantic Scan provides
significantly better event detection and characterization accuracy than
competing approaches, while providing up to an order of magnitude speedup.
