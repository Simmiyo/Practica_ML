Probabilistic Recovery of Multiple Subspaces in Point Clouds by
  Geometric lp Minimization
We assume data independently sampled from a mixture distribution on the unit
ball of the D-dimensional Euclidean space with K+1 components: the first
component is a uniform distribution on that ball representing outliers and the
other K components are uniform distributions along K d-dimensional linear
subspaces restricted to that ball. We study both the simultaneous recovery of
all K underlying subspaces and the recovery of the best l0 subspace (i.e., with
largest number of points) by minimizing the lp-averaged distances of data
points from d-dimensional subspaces of the D-dimensional space. Unlike other lp
minimization problems, this minimization is non-convex for all p>0 and thus
requires different methods for its analysis. We show that if 0<p <= 1, then
both all underlying subspaces and the best l0 subspace can be precisely
recovered by lp minimization with overwhelming probability. This result extends
to additive homoscedastic uniform noise around the subspaces (i.e., uniform
distribution in a strip around them) and near recovery with an error
proportional to the noise level. On the other hand, if K>1 and p>1, then we
show that both all underlying subspaces and the best l0 subspace cannot be
recovered and even nearly recovered. Further relaxations are also discussed. We
use the results of this paper for partially justifying recent effective
algorithms for modeling data by mixtures of multiple subspaces as well as for
discussing the effect of using variants of lp minimizations in RANSAC-type
strategies for single subspace recovery.
