A Random Finite Set Model for Data Clustering
The goal of data clustering is to partition data points into groups to
minimize a given objective function. While most existing clustering algorithms
treat each data point as vector, in many applications each datum is not a
vector but a point pattern or a set of points. Moreover, many existing
clustering methods require the user to specify the number of clusters, which is
not available in advance. This paper proposes a new class of models for data
clustering that addresses set-valued data as well as unknown number of
clusters, using a Dirichlet Process mixture of Poisson random finite sets. We
also develop an efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo posterior inference
technique that can learn the number of clusters and mixture parameters
automatically from the data. Numerical studies are presented to demonstrate the
salient features of this new model, in particular its capacity to discover
extremely unbalanced clusters in data.
