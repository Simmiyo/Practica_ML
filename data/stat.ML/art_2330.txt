Policy Evaluation with Variance Related Risk Criteria in Markov Decision
  Processes
In this paper we extend temporal difference policy evaluation algorithms to
performance criteria that include the variance of the cumulative reward. Such
criteria are useful for risk management, and are important in domains such as
finance and process control. We propose both TD(0) and LSTD(lambda) variants
with linear function approximation, prove their convergence, and demonstrate
their utility in a 4-dimensional continuous state space problem.
