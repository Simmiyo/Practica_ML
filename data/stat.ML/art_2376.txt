Supervised Classification Using Sparse Fisher's LDA
It is well known that in a supervised classification setting when the number
of features is smaller than the number of observations, Fisher's linear
discriminant rule is asymptotically Bayes. However, there are numerous modern
applications where classification is needed in the high-dimensional setting.
Naive implementation of Fisher's rule in this case fails to provide good
results because the sample covariance matrix is singular. Moreover, by
constructing a classifier that relies on all features the interpretation of the
results is challenging. Our goal is to provide robust classification that
relies only on a small subset of important features and accounts for the
underlying correlation structure. We apply a lasso-type penalty to the
discriminant vector to ensure sparsity of the solution and use a shrinkage type
estimator for the covariance matrix. The resulting optimization problem is
solved using an iterative coordinate ascent algorithm. Furthermore, we analyze
the effect of nonconvexity on the sparsity level of the solution and highlight
the difference between the penalized and the constrained versions of the
problem. The simulation results show that the proposed method performs
favorably in comparison to alternatives. The method is used to classify
leukemia patients based on DNA methylation features.
