Admissible Hierarchical Clustering Methods and Algorithms for Asymmetric
  Networks
This paper characterizes hierarchical clustering methods that abide by two
previously introduced axioms -- thus, denominated admissible methods -- and
proposes tractable algorithms for their implementation. We leverage the fact
that, for asymmetric networks, every admissible method must be contained
between reciprocal and nonreciprocal clustering, and describe three families of
intermediate methods. Grafting methods exchange branches between dendrograms
generated by different admissible methods. The convex combination family
combines admissible methods through a convex operation in the space of
dendrograms, and thirdly, the semi-reciprocal family clusters nodes that are
related by strong cyclic influences in the network. Algorithms for the
computation of hierarchical clusters generated by reciprocal and nonreciprocal
clustering as well as the grafting, convex combination, and semi-reciprocal
families are derived using matrix operations in a dioid algebra. Finally, the
introduced clustering methods and algorithms are exemplified through their
application to a network describing the interrelation between sectors of the
United States (U.S.) economy.
