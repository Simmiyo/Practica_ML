Spatial Decompositions for Large Scale SVMs
Although support vector machines (SVMs) are theoretically well understood,
their underlying optimization problem becomes very expensive, if, for example,
hundreds of thousands of samples and a non-linear kernel are considered.
Several approaches have been proposed in the past to address this serious
limitation. In this work we investigate a decomposition strategy that learns on
small, spatially defined data chunks. Our contributions are two fold: On the
theoretical side we establish an oracle inequality for the overall learning
method using the hinge loss, and show that the resulting rates match those
known for SVMs solving the complete optimization problem with Gaussian kernels.
On the practical side we compare our approach to learning SVMs on small,
randomly chosen chunks. Here it turns out that for comparable training times
our approach is significantly faster during testing and also reduces the test
error in most cases significantly. Furthermore, we show that our approach
easily scales up to 10 million training samples: including hyper-parameter
selection using cross validation, the entire training only takes a few hours on
a single machine. Finally, we report an experiment on 32 million training
samples. All experiments used liquidSVM (Steinwart and Thomann, 2017).
