Adjustable Bounded Rectifiers: Towards Deep Binary Representations
Binary representation is desirable for its memory efficiency, computation
speed and robustness. In this paper, we propose adjustable bounded rectifiers
to learn binary representations for deep neural networks. While hard
constraining representations across layers to be binary makes training
unreasonably difficult, we softly encourage activations to diverge from real
values to binary by approximating step functions. Our final representation is
completely binary. We test our approach on MNIST, CIFAR10, and ILSVRC2012
dataset, and systematically study the training dynamics of the binarization
process. Our approach can binarize the last layer representation without loss
of performance and binarize all the layers with reasonably small degradations.
The memory space that it saves may allow more sophisticated models to be
deployed, thus compensating the loss. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to report results on current deep network architectures using
complete binary middle representations. Given the learned representations, we
find that the firing or inhibition of a binary neuron is usually associated
with a meaningful interpretation across different classes. This suggests that
the semantic structure of a neural network may be manifested through a guided
binarization process.
