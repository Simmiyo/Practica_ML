Group Lasso with Overlaps: the Latent Group Lasso approach
We study a norm for structured sparsity which leads to sparse linear
predictors whose supports are unions of prede ned overlapping groups of
variables. We call the obtained formulation latent group Lasso, since it is
based on applying the usual group Lasso penalty on a set of latent variables. A
detailed analysis of the norm and its properties is presented and we
characterize conditions under which the set of groups associated with latent
variables are correctly identi ed. We motivate and discuss the delicate choice
of weights associated to each group, and illustrate this approach on simulated
data and on the problem of breast cancer prognosis from gene expression data.
