Distributed Processing of Biosignal-Database for Emotion Recognition
  with Mahout
This paper investigates the use of distributed processing on the problem of
emotion recognition from physiological sensors using a popular machine learning
library on distributed mode. Specifically, we run a random forests classifier
on the biosignal-data, which have been pre-processed to form exclusive groups
in an unsupervised fashion, on a Cloudera cluster using Mahout. The use of
distributed processing significantly reduces the time required for the offline
training of the classifier, enabling processing of large physiological datasets
through many iterations.
