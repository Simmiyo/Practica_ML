Cumulative distribution networks and the derivative-sum-product
  algorithm
We introduce a new type of graphical model called a "cumulative distribution
network" (CDN), which expresses a joint cumulative distribution as a product of
local functions. Each local function can be viewed as providing evidence about
possible orderings, or rankings, of variables. Interestingly, we find that the
conditional independence properties of CDNs are quite different from other
graphical models. We also describe a messagepassing algorithm that efficiently
computes conditional cumulative distributions. Due to the unique independence
properties of the CDN, these messages do not in general have a one-to-one
correspondence with messages exchanged in standard algorithms, such as belief
propagation. We demonstrate the application of CDNs for structured ranking
learning using a previously-studied multi-player gaming dataset.
