Interactive Semantic Featuring for Text Classification
In text classification, dictionaries can be used to define
human-comprehensible features. We propose an improvement to dictionary features
called smoothed dictionary features. These features recognize document contexts
instead of n-grams. We describe a principled methodology to solicit dictionary
features from a teacher, and present results showing that models built using
these human-comprehensible features are competitive with models trained with
Bag of Words features.
