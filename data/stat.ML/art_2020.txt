Bounds on the Bethe Free Energy for Gaussian Networks
We address the problem of computing approximate marginals in Gaussian
probabilistic models by using mean field and fractional Bethe approximations.
As an extension of Welling and Teh (2001), we define the Gaussian fractional
Bethe free energy in terms of the moment parameters of the approximate
marginals and derive an upper and lower bound for it. We give necessary
conditions for the Gaussian fractional Bethe free energies to be bounded from
below. It turns out that the bounding condition is the same as the pairwise
normalizability condition derived by Malioutov et al. (2006) as a sufficient
condition for the convergence of the message passing algorithm. By giving a
counterexample, we disprove the conjecture in Welling and Teh (2001): even when
the Bethe free energy is not bounded from below, it can possess a local minimum
to which the minimization algorithms can converge.
