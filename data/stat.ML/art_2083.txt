A Geometric Algorithm for Scalable Multiple Kernel Learning
We present a geometric formulation of the Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL)
problem. To do so, we reinterpret the problem of learning kernel weights as
searching for a kernel that maximizes the minimum (kernel) distance between two
convex polytopes. This interpretation combined with novel structural insights
from our geometric formulation allows us to reduce the MKL problem to a simple
optimization routine that yields provable convergence as well as quality
guarantees. As a result our method scales efficiently to much larger data sets
than most prior methods can handle. Empirical evaluation on eleven datasets
shows that we are significantly faster and even compare favorably with a
uniform unweighted combination of kernels.
