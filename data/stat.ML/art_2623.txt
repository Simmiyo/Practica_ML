Determinantal Clustering Processes - A Nonparametric Bayesian Approach
  to Kernel Based Semi-Supervised Clustering
Semi-supervised clustering is the task of clustering data points into
clusters where only a fraction of the points are labelled. The true number of
clusters in the data is often unknown and most models require this parameter as
an input. Dirichlet process mixture models are appealing as they can infer the
number of clusters from the data. However, these models do not deal with high
dimensional data well and can encounter difficulties in inference. We present a
novel nonparameteric Bayesian kernel based method to cluster data points
without the need to prespecify the number of clusters or to model complicated
densities from which data points are assumed to be generated from. The key
insight is to use determinants of submatrices of a kernel matrix as a measure
of how close together a set of points are. We explore some theoretical
properties of the model and derive a natural Gibbs based algorithm with MCMC
hyperparameter learning. The model is implemented on a variety of synthetic and
real world data sets.
