Partial Membership Latent Dirichlet Allocation
Topic models (e.g., pLSA, LDA, SLDA) have been widely used for segmenting
imagery. These models are confined to crisp segmentation. Yet, there are many
images in which some regions cannot be assigned a crisp label (e.g., transition
regions between a foggy sky and the ground or between sand and water at a
beach). In these cases, a visual word is best represented with partial
memberships across multiple topics. To address this, we present a partial
membership latent Dirichlet allocation (PM-LDA) model and associated parameter
estimation algorithms. Experimental results on two natural image datasets and
one SONAR image dataset show that PM-LDA can produce both crisp and soft
semantic image segmentations; a capability existing methods do not have.
