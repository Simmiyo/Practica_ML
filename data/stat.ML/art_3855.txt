Efficient Clustering of Correlated Variables and Variable Selection in
  High-Dimensional Linear Models
In this paper, we introduce Adaptive Cluster Lasso(ACL) method for variable
selection in high dimensional sparse regression models with strongly correlated
variables. To handle correlated variables, the concept of clustering or
grouping variables and then pursuing model fitting is widely accepted. When the
dimension is very high, finding an appropriate group structure is as difficult
as the original problem. The ACL is a three-stage procedure where, at the first
stage, we use the Lasso(or its adaptive or thresholded version) to do initial
selection, then we also include those variables which are not selected by the
Lasso but are strongly correlated with the variables selected by the Lasso. At
the second stage we cluster the variables based on the reduced set of
predictors and in the third stage we perform sparse estimation such as Lasso on
cluster representatives or the group Lasso based on the structures generated by
clustering procedure. We show that our procedure is consistent and efficient in
finding true underlying population group structure(under assumption of
irrepresentable and beta-min conditions). We also study the group selection
consistency of our method and we support the theory using simulated and
pseudo-real dataset examples.
