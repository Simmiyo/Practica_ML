P-values for high-dimensional regression
Assigning significance in high-dimensional regression is challenging. Most
computationally efficient selection algorithms cannot guard against inclusion
of noise variables. Asymptotically valid p-values are not available. An
exception is a recent proposal by Wasserman and Roeder (2008) which splits the
data into two parts. The number of variables is then reduced to a manageable
size using the first split, while classical variable selection techniques can
be applied to the remaining variables, using the data from the second split.
This yields asymptotic error control under minimal conditions. It involves,
however, a one-time random split of the data. Results are sensitive to this
arbitrary choice: it amounts to a `p-value lottery' and makes it difficult to
reproduce results. Here, we show that inference across multiple random splits
can be aggregated, while keeping asymptotic control over the inclusion of noise
variables. We show that the resulting p-values can be used for control of both
family-wise error (FWER) and false discovery rate (FDR). In addition, the
proposed aggregation is shown to improve power while reducing the number of
falsely selected variables substantially.
