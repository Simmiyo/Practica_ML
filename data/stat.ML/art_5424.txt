Gaussian process regression for forecasting battery state of health
Accurately predicting the future capacity and remaining useful life of
batteries is necessary to ensure reliable system operation and to minimise
maintenance costs. The complex nature of battery degradation has meant that
mechanistic modelling of capacity fade has thus far remained intractable;
however, with the advent of cloud-connected devices, data from cells in various
applications is becoming increasingly available, and the feasibility of
data-driven methods for battery prognostics is increasing. Here we propose
Gaussian process (GP) regression for forecasting battery state of health, and
highlight various advantages of GPs over other data-driven and mechanistic
approaches. GPs are a type of Bayesian non-parametric method, and hence can
model complex systems whilst handling uncertainty in a principled manner. Prior
information can be exploited by GPs in a variety of ways: explicit mean
functions can be used if the functional form of the underlying degradation
model is available, and multiple-output GPs can effectively exploit
correlations between data from different cells. We demonstrate the predictive
capability of GPs for short-term and long-term (remaining useful life)
forecasting on a selection of capacity vs. cycle datasets from lithium-ion
cells.
