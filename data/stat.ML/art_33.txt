An information-theoretic derivation of min-cut based clustering
Min-cut clustering, based on minimizing one of two heuristic cost-functions
proposed by Shi and Malik, has spawned tremendous research, both analytic and
algorithmic, in the graph partitioning and image segmentation communities over
the last decade. It is however unclear if these heuristics can be derived from
a more general principle facilitating generalization to new problem settings.
Motivated by an existing graph partitioning framework, we derive relationships
between optimizing relevance information, as defined in the Information
Bottleneck method, and the regularized cut in a K-partitioned graph. For fast
mixing graphs, we show that the cost functions introduced by Shi and Malik can
be well approximated as the rate of loss of predictive information about the
location of random walkers on the graph. For graphs generated from a stochastic
algorithm designed to model community structure, the optimal information
theoretic partition and the optimal min-cut partition are shown to be the same
with high probability.
