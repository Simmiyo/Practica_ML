Machine Learning, Linear and Bayesian Models for Logistic Regression in
  Failure Detection Problems
In this work, we study the use of logistic regression in manufacturing
failures detection. As a data set for the analysis, we used the data from
Kaggle competition Bosch Production Line Performance. We considered the use of
machine learning, linear and Bayesian models. For machine learning approach, we
analyzed XGBoost tree based classifier to obtain high scored classification.
Using the generalized linear model for logistic regression makes it possible to
analyze the influence of the factors under study. The Bayesian approach for
logistic regression gives the statistical distribution for the parameters of
the model. It can be useful in the probabilistic analysis, e.g. risk
assessment.
