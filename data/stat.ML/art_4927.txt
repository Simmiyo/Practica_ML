Temporal Learning and Sequence Modeling for a Job Recommender System
We present our solution to the job recommendation task for RecSys Challenge
2016. The main contribution of our work is to combine temporal learning with
sequence modeling to capture complex user-item activity patterns to improve job
recommendations. First, we propose a time-based ranking model applied to
historical observations and a hybrid matrix factorization over time re-weighted
interactions. Second, we exploit sequence properties in user-items activities
and develop a RNN-based recommendation model. Our solution achieved 5$^{th}$
place in the challenge among more than 100 participants. Notably, the strong
performance of our RNN approach shows a promising new direction in employing
sequence modeling for recommendation systems.
