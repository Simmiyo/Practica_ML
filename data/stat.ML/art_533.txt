Confidence intervals for AB-test
AB-testing is a very popular technique in web companies since it makes it
possible to accurately predict the impact of a modification with the simplicity
of a random split across users. One of the critical aspects of an AB-test is
its duration and it is important to reliably compute confidence intervals
associated with the metric of interest to know when to stop the test. In this
paper, we define a clean mathematical framework to model the AB-test process.
We then propose three algorithms based on bootstrapping and on the central
limit theorem to compute reliable confidence intervals which extend to other
metrics than the common probabilities of success. They apply to both absolute
and relative increments of the most used comparison metrics, including the
number of occurrences of a particular event and a click-through rate implying a
ratio.
