Fast Convergent Algorithms for Expectation Propagation Approximate
  Bayesian Inference
We propose a novel algorithm to solve the expectation propagation relaxation
of Bayesian inference for continuous-variable graphical models. In contrast to
most previous algorithms, our method is provably convergent. By marrying
convergent EP ideas from (Opper&Winther 05) with covariance decoupling
techniques (Wipf&Nagarajan 08, Nickisch&Seeger 09), it runs at least an order
of magnitude faster than the most commonly used EP solver.
