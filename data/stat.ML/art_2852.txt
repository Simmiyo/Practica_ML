Random forests with random projections of the output space for high
  dimensional multi-label classification
We adapt the idea of random projections applied to the output space, so as to
enhance tree-based ensemble methods in the context of multi-label
classification. We show how learning time complexity can be reduced without
affecting computational complexity and accuracy of predictions. We also show
that random output space projections may be used in order to reach different
bias-variance tradeoffs, over a broad panel of benchmark problems, and that
this may lead to improved accuracy while reducing significantly the
computational burden of the learning stage.
