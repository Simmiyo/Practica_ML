Incremental Variational Inference for Latent Dirichlet Allocation
We introduce incremental variational inference and apply it to latent
Dirichlet allocation (LDA). Incremental variational inference is inspired by
incremental EM and provides an alternative to stochastic variational inference.
Incremental LDA can process massive document collections, does not require to
set a learning rate, converges faster to a local optimum of the variational
bound and enjoys the attractive property of monotonically increasing it. We
study the performance of incremental LDA on large benchmark data sets. We
further introduce a stochastic approximation of incremental variational
inference which extends to the asynchronous distributed setting. The resulting
distributed algorithm achieves comparable performance as single host
incremental variational inference, but with a significant speed-up.
