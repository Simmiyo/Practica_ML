Dimension Reduction Using Rule Ensemble Machine Learning Methods: A
  Numerical Study of Three Ensemble Methods
Ensemble methods for supervised machine learning have become popular due to
their ability to accurately predict class labels with groups of simple,
lightweight "base learners." While ensembles offer computationally efficient
models that have good predictive capability they tend to be large and offer
little insight into the patterns or structure in a dataset. We consider an
ensemble technique that returns a model of ranked rules. The model accurately
predicts class labels and has the advantage of indicating which parameter
constraints are most useful for predicting those labels. An example of the rule
ensemble method successfully ranking rules and selecting attributes is given
with a dataset containing images of potential supernovas where the number of
necessary features is reduced from 39 to 21. We also compare the rule ensemble
method on a set of multi-class problems with boosting and bagging, which are
two well known ensemble techniques that use decision trees as base learners,
but do not have a rule ranking scheme.
