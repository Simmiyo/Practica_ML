Unsupervised Joint Alignment and Clustering using Bayesian
  Nonparametrics
Joint alignment of a collection of functions is the process of independently
transforming the functions so that they appear more similar to each other.
Typically, such unsupervised alignment algorithms fail when presented with
complex data sets arising from multiple modalities or make restrictive
assumptions about the form of the functions or transformations, limiting their
generality. We present a transformed Bayesian infinite mixture model that can
simultaneously align and cluster a data set. Our model and associated learning
scheme offer two key advantages: the optimal number of clusters is determined
in a data-driven fashion through the use of a Dirichlet process prior, and it
can accommodate any transformation function parameterized by a continuous
parameter vector. As a result, it is applicable to a wide range of data types,
and transformation functions. We present positive results on synthetic
two-dimensional data, on a set of one-dimensional curves, and on various image
data sets, showing large improvements over previous work. We discuss several
variations of the model and conclude with directions for future work.
