Random Forests for Metric Learning with Implicit Pairwise Position
  Dependence
Metric learning makes it plausible to learn distances for complex
distributions of data from labeled data. However, to date, most metric learning
methods are based on a single Mahalanobis metric, which cannot handle
heterogeneous data well. Those that learn multiple metrics throughout the space
have demonstrated superior accuracy, but at the cost of computational
efficiency. Here, we take a new angle to the metric learning problem and learn
a single metric that is able to implicitly adapt its distance function
throughout the feature space. This metric adaptation is accomplished by using a
random forest-based classifier to underpin the distance function and
incorporate both absolute pairwise position and standard relative position into
the representation. We have implemented and tested our method against state of
the art global and multi-metric methods on a variety of data sets. Overall, the
proposed method outperforms both types of methods in terms of accuracy
(consistently ranked first) and is an order of magnitude faster than state of
the art multi-metric methods (16x faster in the worst case).
