Direct Learning of Sparse Changes in Markov Networks by Density Ratio
  Estimation
We propose a new method for detecting changes in Markov network structure
between two sets of samples. Instead of naively fitting two Markov network
models separately to the two data sets and figuring out their difference, we
\emph{directly} learn the network structure change by estimating the ratio of
Markov network models. This density-ratio formulation naturally allows us to
introduce sparsity in the network structure change, which highly contributes to
enhancing interpretability. Furthermore, computation of the normalization term,
which is a critical bottleneck of the naive approach, can be remarkably
mitigated. We also give the dual formulation of the optimization problem, which
further reduces the computation cost for large-scale Markov networks. Through
experiments, we demonstrate the usefulness of our method.
