Semi-supervised Tuning from Temporal Coherence
Recent works demonstrated the usefulness of temporal coherence to regularize
supervised training or to learn invariant features with deep architectures. In
particular, enforcing smooth output changes while presenting temporally-closed
frames from video sequences, proved to be an effective strategy. In this paper
we prove the efficacy of temporal coherence for semi-supervised incremental
tuning. We show that a deep architecture, just mildly trained in a supervised
manner, can progressively improve its classification accuracy, if exposed to
video sequences of unlabeled data. The extent to which, in some cases, a
semi-supervised tuning allows to improve classification accuracy (approaching
the supervised one) is somewhat surprising. A number of control experiments
pointed out the fundamental role of temporal coherence.
