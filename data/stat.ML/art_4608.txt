Loss Bounds and Time Complexity for Speed Priors
This paper establishes for the first time the predictive performance of speed
priors and their computational complexity. A speed prior is essentially a
probability distribution that puts low probability on strings that are not
efficiently computable. We propose a variant to the original speed prior
(Schmidhuber, 2002), and show that our prior can predict sequences drawn from
probability measures that are estimable in polynomial time. Our speed prior is
computable in doubly-exponential time, but not in polynomial time. On a
polynomial time computable sequence our speed prior is computable in
exponential time. We show better upper complexity bounds for Schmidhuber's
speed prior under the same conditions, and that it predicts deterministic
sequences that are computable in polynomial time; however, we also show that it
is not computable in polynomial time, and the question of its predictive
properties for stochastic sequences remains open.
