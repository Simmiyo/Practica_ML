MixEst: An Estimation Toolbox for Mixture Models
Mixture models are powerful statistical models used in many applications
ranging from density estimation to clustering and classification. When dealing
with mixture models, there are many issues that the experimenter should be
aware of and needs to solve. The MixEst toolbox is a powerful and user-friendly
package for MATLAB that implements several state-of-the-art approaches to
address these problems. Additionally, MixEst gives the possibility of using
manifold optimization for fitting the density model, a feature specific to this
toolbox. MixEst simplifies using and integration of mixture models in
statistical models and applications. For developing mixture models of new
densities, the user just needs to provide a few functions for that statistical
distribution and the toolbox takes care of all the issues regarding mixture
models. MixEst is available at visionlab.ut.ac.ir/mixest and is fully
documented and is licensed under GPL.
