Stable Graphical Models
Stable random variables are motivated by the central limit theorem for
densities with (potentially) unbounded variance and can be thought of as
natural generalizations of the Gaussian distribution to skewed and heavy-tailed
phenomenon. In this paper, we introduce stable graphical (SG) models, a class
of multivariate stable densities that can also be represented as Bayesian
networks whose edges encode linear dependencies between random variables. One
major hurdle to the extensive use of stable distributions is the lack of a
closed-form analytical expression for their densities. This makes penalized
maximum-likelihood based learning computationally demanding. We establish
theoretically that the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) can asymptotically
be reduced to the computationally more tractable minimum dispersion criterion
(MDC) and develop StabLe, a structure learning algorithm based on MDC. We use
simulated datasets for five benchmark network topologies to empirically
demonstrate how StabLe improves upon ordinary least squares (OLS) regression.
We also apply StabLe to microarray gene expression data for lymphoblastoid
cells from 727 individuals belonging to eight global population groups. We
establish that StabLe improves test set performance relative to OLS via
ten-fold cross-validation. Finally, we develop SGEX, a method for quantifying
differential expression of genes between different population groups.
