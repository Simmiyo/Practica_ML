On the Identifiability of the Post-Nonlinear Causal Model
By taking into account the nonlinear effect of the cause, the inner noise
effect, and the measurement distortion effect in the observed variables, the
post-nonlinear (PNL) causal model has demonstrated its excellent performance in
distinguishing the cause from effect. However, its identifiability has not been
properly addressed, and how to apply it in the case of more than two variables
is also a problem. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation on its
identifiability in the two-variable case. We show that this model is
identifiable in most cases; by enumerating all possible situations in which the
model is not identifiable, we provide sufficient conditions for its
identifiability. Simulations are given to support the theoretical results.
Moreover, in the case of more than two variables, we show that the whole causal
structure can be found by applying the PNL causal model to each structure in
the Markov equivalent class and testing if the disturbance is independent of
the direct causes for each variable. In this way the exhaustive search over all
possible causal structures is avoided.
