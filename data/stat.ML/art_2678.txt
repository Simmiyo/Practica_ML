An Inexact Proximal Path-Following Algorithm for Constrained Convex
  Minimization
Many scientific and engineering applications feature nonsmooth convex
minimization problems over convex sets. In this paper, we address an important
instance of this broad class where we assume that the nonsmooth objective is
equipped with a tractable proximity operator and that the convex constraint set
affords a self-concordant barrier. We provide a new joint treatment of proximal
and self-concordant barrier concepts and illustrate that such problems can be
efficiently solved, without the need of lifting the problem dimensions, as in
disciplined convex optimization approach. We propose an inexact path-following
algorithmic framework and theoretically characterize the worst-case analytical
complexity of this framework when the proximal subproblems are solved
inexactly. To show the merits of our framework, we apply its instances to both
synthetic and real-world applications, where it shows advantages over standard
interior point methods. As a by-product, we describe how our framework can
obtain points on the Pareto frontier of regularized problems with
self-concordant objectives in a tuning free fashion.
