Making brain-machine interfaces robust to future neural variability
A major hurdle to clinical translation of brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) is
that current decoders, which are trained from a small quantity of recent data,
become ineffective when neural recording conditions subsequently change. We
tested whether a decoder could be made more robust to future neural variability
by training it to handle a variety of recording conditions sampled from months
of previously collected data as well as synthetic training data perturbations.
We developed a new multiplicative recurrent neural network BMI decoder that
successfully learned a large variety of neural-to- kinematic mappings and
became more robust with larger training datasets. When tested with a non-human
primate preclinical BMI model, this decoder was robust under conditions that
disabled a state-of-the-art Kalman filter based decoder. These results validate
a new BMI strategy in which accumulated data history is effectively harnessed,
and may facilitate reliable daily BMI use by reducing decoder retraining
downtime.
