An Entropy Search Portfolio for Bayesian Optimization
Bayesian optimization is a sample-efficient method for black-box global
optimization. How- ever, the performance of a Bayesian optimization method very
much depends on its exploration strategy, i.e. the choice of acquisition
function, and it is not clear a priori which choice will result in superior
performance. While portfolio methods provide an effective, principled way of
combining a collection of acquisition functions, they are often based on
measures of past performance which can be misleading. To address this issue, we
introduce the Entropy Search Portfolio (ESP): a novel approach to portfolio
construction which is motivated by information theoretic considerations. We
show that ESP outperforms existing portfolio methods on several real and
synthetic problems, including geostatistical datasets and simulated control
tasks. We not only show that ESP is able to offer performance as good as the
best, but unknown, acquisition function, but surprisingly it often gives better
performance. Finally, over a wide range of conditions we find that ESP is
robust to the inclusion of poor acquisition functions.
