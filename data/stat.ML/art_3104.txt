Mutual Information-Based Unsupervised Feature Transformation for
  Heterogeneous Feature Subset Selection
Conventional mutual information (MI) based feature selection (FS) methods are
unable to handle heterogeneous feature subset selection properly because of
data format differences or estimation methods of MI between feature subset and
class label. A way to solve this problem is feature transformation (FT). In
this study, a novel unsupervised feature transformation (UFT) which can
transform non-numerical features into numerical features is developed and
tested. The UFT process is MI-based and independent of class label. MI-based FS
algorithms, such as Parzen window feature selector (PWFS), minimum redundancy
maximum relevance feature selection (mRMR), and normalized MI feature selection
(NMIFS), can all adopt UFT for pre-processing of non-numerical features. Unlike
traditional FT methods, the proposed UFT is unbiased while PWFS is utilized to
its full advantage. Simulations and analyses of large-scale datasets showed
that feature subset selected by the integrated method, UFT-PWFS, outperformed
other FT-FS integrated methods in classification accuracy.
