Bayesian Structure Learning for Markov Random Fields with a Spike and
  Slab Prior
In recent years a number of methods have been developed for automatically
learning the (sparse) connectivity structure of Markov Random Fields. These
methods are mostly based on L1-regularized optimization which has a number of
disadvantages such as the inability to assess model uncertainty and expensive
cross-validation to find the optimal regularization parameter. Moreover, the
model's predictive performance may degrade dramatically with a suboptimal value
of the regularization parameter (which is sometimes desirable to induce
sparseness). We propose a fully Bayesian approach based on a "spike and slab"
prior (similar to L0 regularization) that does not suffer from these
shortcomings. We develop an approximate MCMC method combining Langevin dynamics
and reversible jump MCMC to conduct inference in this model. Experiments show
that the proposed model learns a good combination of the structure and
parameter values without the need for separate hyper-parameter tuning.
Moreover, the model's predictive performance is much more robust than L1-based
methods with hyper-parameter settings that induce highly sparse model
structures.
