Parameter-Free Spectral Kernel Learning
Due to the growing ubiquity of unlabeled data, learning with unlabeled data
is attracting increasing attention in machine learning. In this paper, we
propose a novel semi-supervised kernel learning method which can seamlessly
combine manifold structure of unlabeled data and Regularized Least-Squares
(RLS) to learn a new kernel. Interestingly, the new kernel matrix can be
obtained analytically with the use of spectral decomposition of graph Laplacian
matrix. Hence, the proposed algorithm does not require any numerical
optimization solvers. Moreover, by maximizing kernel target alignment on
labeled data, we can also learn model parameters automatically with a
closed-form solution. For a given graph Laplacian matrix, our proposed method
does not need to tune any model parameter including the tradeoff parameter in
RLS and the balance parameter for unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on ten
benchmark datasets show that our proposed two-stage parameter-free spectral
kernel learning algorithm can obtain comparable performance with fine-tuned
manifold regularization methods in transductive setting, and outperform
multiple kernel learning in supervised setting.
