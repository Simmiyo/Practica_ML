Detailed Derivations of Small-Variance Asymptotics for some Hierarchical
  Bayesian Nonparametric Models
In this note we provide detailed derivations of two versions of
small-variance asymptotics for hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) mixture
models and the HDP hidden Markov model (HDP-HMM, a.k.a. the infinite HMM). We
include derivations for the probabilities of certain CRP and CRF partitions,
which are of more general interest.
