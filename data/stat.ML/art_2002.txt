Sparse Trace Norm Regularization
We study the problem of estimating multiple predictive functions from a
dictionary of basis functions in the nonparametric regression setting. Our
estimation scheme assumes that each predictive function can be estimated in the
form of a linear combination of the basis functions. By assuming that the
coefficient matrix admits a sparse low-rank structure, we formulate the
function estimation problem as a convex program regularized by the trace norm
and the $\ell_1$-norm simultaneously. We propose to solve the convex program
using the accelerated gradient (AG) method and the alternating direction method
of multipliers (ADMM) respectively; we also develop efficient algorithms to
solve the key components in both AG and ADMM. In addition, we conduct
theoretical analysis on the proposed function estimation scheme: we derive a
key property of the optimal solution to the convex program; based on an
assumption on the basis functions, we establish a performance bound of the
proposed function estimation scheme (via the composite regularization).
Simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed
algorithms.
