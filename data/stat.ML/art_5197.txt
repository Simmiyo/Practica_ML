Learning Traffic as Images: A Deep Convolutional Neural Network for
  Large-Scale Transportation Network Speed Prediction
This paper proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method that
learns traffic as images and predicts large-scale, network-wide traffic speed
with a high accuracy. Spatiotemporal traffic dynamics are converted to images
describing the time and space relations of traffic flow via a two-dimensional
time-space matrix. A CNN is applied to the image following two consecutive
steps: abstract traffic feature extraction and network-wide traffic speed
prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by taking two
real-world transportation networks, the second ring road and north-east
transportation network in Beijing, as examples, and comparing the method with
four prevailing algorithms, namely, ordinary least squares, k-nearest
neighbors, artificial neural network, and random forest, and three deep
learning architectures, namely, stacked autoencoder, recurrent neural network,
and long-short-term memory network. The results show that the proposed method
outperforms other algorithms by an average accuracy improvement of 42.91%
within an acceptable execution time. The CNN can train the model in a
reasonable time and, thus, is suitable for large-scale transportation networks.
