Random projection trees for vector quantization
A simple and computationally efficient scheme for tree-structured vector
quantization is presented. Unlike previous methods, its quantization error
depends only on the intrinsic dimension of the data distribution, rather than
the apparent dimension of the space in which the data happen to lie.
