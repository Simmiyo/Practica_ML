Deep Learning Algorithms for Signal Recognition in Long Perimeter
  Monitoring Distributed Fiber Optic Sensors
In this paper, we show an approach to build deep learning algorithms for
recognizing signals in distributed fiber optic monitoring and security systems
for long perimeters. Synthesizing such detection algorithms poses a non-trivial
research and development challenge, because these systems face stringent error
(type I and II) requirements and operate in difficult signal-jamming
environments, with intensive signal-like jamming and a variety of changing
possible signal portraits of possible recognized events. To address these
issues, we have developed a twolevel event detection architecture, where the
primary classifier is based on an ensemble of deep convolutional networks, can
recognize 7 classes of signals and receives time-space data frames as input.
Using real-life data, we have shown that the applied methods result in
efficient and robust multiclass detection algorithms that have a high degree of
adaptability.
