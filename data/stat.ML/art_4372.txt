Prediction Scores as a Window into Classifier Behavior
Most multi-class classifiers make their prediction for a test sample by
scoring the classes and selecting the one with the highest score. Analyzing
these prediction scores is useful to understand the classifier behavior and to
assess its reliability. We present an interactive visualization that
facilitates per-class analysis of these scores. Our system, called Classilist,
enables relating these scores to the classification correctness and to the
underlying samples and their features. We illustrate how such analysis reveals
varying behavior of different classifiers. Classilist is available for use
online, along with source code, video tutorials, and plugins for R, RapidMiner,
and KNIME at https://katehara.github.io/classilist-site/.
