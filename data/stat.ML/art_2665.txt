Online Ensemble Learning for Imbalanced Data Streams
While both cost-sensitive learning and online learning have been studied
extensively, the effort in simultaneously dealing with these two issues is
limited. Aiming at this challenge task, a novel learning framework is proposed
in this paper. The key idea is based on the fusion of online ensemble
algorithms and the state of the art batch mode cost-sensitive bagging/boosting
algorithms. Within this framework, two separately developed research areas are
bridged together, and a batch of theoretically sound online cost-sensitive
bagging and online cost-sensitive boosting algorithms are first proposed.
Unlike other online cost-sensitive learning algorithms lacking theoretical
analysis of asymptotic properties, the convergence of the proposed algorithms
is guaranteed under certain conditions, and the experimental evidence with
benchmark data sets also validates the effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed methods.
