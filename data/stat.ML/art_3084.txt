Deep Multi-Instance Transfer Learning
We present a new approach for transferring knowledge from groups to
individuals that comprise them. We evaluate our method in text, by inferring
the ratings of individual sentences using full-review ratings. This approach,
which combines ideas from transfer learning, deep learning and multi-instance
learning, reduces the need for laborious human labelling of fine-grained data
when abundant labels are available at the group level.
