A Greedy, Flexible Algorithm to Learn an Optimal Bayesian Network
  Structure
In this report paper we first present a report of the Advanced Machine
Learning Course Project on the provided data set and then present a novel
heuristic algorithm for exact Bayesian network (BN) structure discovery that
uses decomposable scoring functions. Our algorithm follows a different approach
to solve the problem of BN structure discovery than the previously used methods
such as Dynamic Programming (DP) and Branch and Bound to reduce the search
space and find the global optima space for the problem. The algorithm we
propose has some degree of flexibility that can make it more or less greedy.
The more the algorithm is set to be greedy, the more the speed of the algorithm
will be, and the less optimal the final structure. Our algorithm runs in a much
less time than the previously known methods and guarantees to have an
optimality of close to 99%. Therefore, it sacrifices less than one percent of
score of an optimal structure in order to gain a much lower running time and
make the algorithm feasible for large data sets (we may note that we never used
any toolbox except for result validation)
