Asymptotic Accuracy of Distribution-Based Estimation for Latent
  Variables
Hierarchical statistical models are widely employed in information science
and data engineering. The models consist of two types of variables: observable
variables that represent the given data and latent variables for the
unobservable labels. An asymptotic analysis of the models plays an important
role in evaluating the learning process; the result of the analysis is applied
not only to theoretical but also to practical situations, such as optimal model
selection and active learning. There are many studies of generalization errors,
which measure the prediction accuracy of the observable variables. However, the
accuracy of estimating the latent variables has not yet been elucidated. For a
quantitative evaluation of this, the present paper formulates
distribution-based functions for the errors in the estimation of the latent
variables. The asymptotic behavior is analyzed for both the maximum likelihood
and the Bayes methods.
