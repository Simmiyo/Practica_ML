Predictive Interval Models for Non-parametric Regression
Having a regression model, we are interested in finding two-sided intervals
that are guaranteed to contain at least a desired proportion of the conditional
distribution of the response variable given a specific combination of
predictors. We name such intervals predictive intervals. This work presents a
new method to find two-sided predictive intervals for non-parametric least
squares regression without the homoscedasticity assumption. Our predictive
intervals are built by using tolerance intervals on prediction errors in the
query point's neighborhood. We proposed a predictive interval model test and we
also used it as a constraint in our hyper-parameter tuning algorithm. This
gives an algorithm that finds the smallest reliable predictive intervals for a
given dataset. We also introduce a measure for comparing different interval
prediction methods yielding intervals having different size and coverage. These
experiments show that our methods are more reliable, effective and precise than
other interval prediction methods.
