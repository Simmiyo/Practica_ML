Identifying confounders using additive noise models
We propose a method for inferring the existence of a latent common cause
('confounder') of two observed random variables. The method assumes that the
two effects of the confounder are (possibly nonlinear) functions of the
confounder plus independent, additive noise. We discuss under which conditions
the model is identifiable (up to an arbitrary reparameterization of the
confounder) from the joint distribution of the effects. We state and prove a
theoretical result that provides evidence for the conjecture that the model is
generically identifiable under suitable technical conditions. In addition, we
propose a practical method to estimate the confounder from a finite i.i.d.
sample of the effects and illustrate that the method works well on both
simulated and real-world data.
