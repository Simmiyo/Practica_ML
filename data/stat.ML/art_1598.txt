From Data to the p-Adic or Ultrametric Model
We model anomaly and change in data by embedding the data in an ultrametric
space. Taking our initial data as cross-tabulation counts (or other input data
formats), Correspondence Analysis allows us to endow the information space with
a Euclidean metric. We then model anomaly or change by an induced ultrametric.
The induced ultrametric that we are particularly interested in takes a
sequential - e.g. temporal - ordering of the data into account. We apply this
work to the flow of narrative expressed in the film script of the Casablanca
movie; and to the evolution between 1988 and 2004 of the Colombian social
conflict and violence.
