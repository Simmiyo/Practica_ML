Convex Biclustering
In the biclustering problem, we seek to simultaneously group observations and
features. While biclustering has applications in a wide array of domains,
ranging from text mining to collaborative filtering, the problem of identifying
structure in high dimensional genomic data motivates this work. In this
context, biclustering enables us to identify subsets of genes that are
co-expressed only within a subset of experimental conditions. We present a
convex formulation of the biclustering problem that possesses a unique global
minimizer and an iterative algorithm, COBRA, that is guaranteed to identify it.
Our approach generates an entire solution path of possible biclusters as a
single tuning parameter is varied. We also show how to reduce the problem of
selecting this tuning parameter to solving a trivial modification of the convex
biclustering problem. The key contributions of our work are its simplicity,
interpretability, and algorithmic guarantees - features that arguably are
lacking in the current alternative algorithms. We demonstrate the advantages of
our approach, which includes stably and reproducibly identifying biclusterings,
on simulated and real microarray data.
