DeepSoft: A vision for a deep model of software
Although software analytics has experienced rapid growth as a research area,
it has not yet reached its full potential for wide industrial adoption. Most of
the existing work in software analytics still relies heavily on costly manual
feature engineering processes, and they mainly address the traditional
classification problems, as opposed to predicting future events. We present a
vision for \emph{DeepSoft}, an \emph{end-to-end} generic framework for modeling
software and its development process to predict future risks and recommend
interventions. DeepSoft, partly inspired by human memory, is built upon the
powerful deep learning-based Long Short Term Memory architecture that is
capable of learning long-term temporal dependencies that occur in software
evolution. Such deep learned patterns of software can be used to address a
range of challenging problems such as code and task recommendation and
prediction. DeepSoft provides a new approach for research into modeling of
source code, risk prediction and mitigation, developer modeling, and
automatically generating code patches from bug reports.
