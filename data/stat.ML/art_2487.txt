Efficient Estimation of the number of neighbours in Probabilistic K
  Nearest Neighbour Classification
Probabilistic k-nearest neighbour (PKNN) classification has been introduced
to improve the performance of original k-nearest neighbour (KNN) classification
algorithm by explicitly modelling uncertainty in the classification of each
feature vector. However, an issue common to both KNN and PKNN is to select the
optimal number of neighbours, $k$. The contribution of this paper is to
incorporate the uncertainty in $k$ into the decision making, and in so doing
use Bayesian model averaging to provide improved classification. Indeed the
problem of assessing the uncertainty in $k$ can be viewed as one of statistical
model selection which is one of the most important technical issues in the
statistics and machine learning domain. In this paper, a new functional
approximation algorithm is proposed to reconstruct the density of the model
(order) without relying on time consuming Monte Carlo simulations. In addition,
this algorithm avoids cross validation by adopting Bayesian framework. The
performance of this algorithm yielded very good performance on several real
experimental datasets.
