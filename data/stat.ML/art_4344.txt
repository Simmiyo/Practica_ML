LIUBoost : Locality Informed Underboosting for Imbalanced Data
  Classification
The problem of class imbalance along with class-overlapping has become a
major issue in the domain of supervised learning. Most supervised learning
algorithms assume equal cardinality of the classes under consideration while
optimizing the cost function and this assumption does not hold true for
imbalanced datasets which results in sub-optimal classification. Therefore,
various approaches, such as undersampling, oversampling, cost-sensitive
learning and ensemble based methods have been proposed for dealing with
imbalanced datasets. However, undersampling suffers from information loss,
oversampling suffers from increased runtime and potential overfitting while
cost-sensitive methods suffer due to inadequately defined cost assignment
schemes. In this paper, we propose a novel boosting based method called
LIUBoost. LIUBoost uses under sampling for balancing the datasets in every
boosting iteration like RUSBoost while incorporating a cost term for every
instance based on their hardness into the weight update formula minimizing the
information loss introduced by undersampling. LIUBoost has been extensively
evaluated on 18 imbalanced datasets and the results indicate significant
improvement over existing best performing method RUSBoost.
