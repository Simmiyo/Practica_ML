Interpreting Tree Ensembles with inTrees
Tree ensembles such as random forests and boosted trees are accurate but
difficult to understand, debug and deploy. In this work, we provide the inTrees
(interpretable trees) framework that extracts, measures, prunes and selects
rules from a tree ensemble, and calculates frequent variable interactions. An
rule-based learner, referred to as the simplified tree ensemble learner (STEL),
can also be formed and used for future prediction. The inTrees framework can
applied to both classification and regression problems, and is applicable to
many types of tree ensembles, e.g., random forests, regularized random forests,
and boosted trees. We implemented the inTrees algorithms in the "inTrees" R
package.
