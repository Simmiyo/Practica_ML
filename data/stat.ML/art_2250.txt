Sparse Ising Models with Covariates
There has been a lot of work fitting Ising models to multivariate binary data
in order to understand the conditional dependency relationships between the
variables. However, additional covariates are frequently recorded together with
the binary data, and may influence the dependence relationships. Motivated by
such a dataset on genomic instability collected from tumor samples of several
types, we propose a sparse covariate dependent Ising model to study both the
conditional dependency within the binary data and its relationship with the
additional covariates. This results in subject-specific Ising models, where the
subject's covariates influence the strength of association between the genes.
As in all exploratory data analysis, interpretability of results is important,
and we use L1 penalties to induce sparsity in the fitted graphs and in the
number of selected covariates. Two algorithms to fit the model are proposed and
compared on a set of simulated data, and asymptotic results are established.
The results on the tumor dataset and their biological significance are
discussed in detail.
