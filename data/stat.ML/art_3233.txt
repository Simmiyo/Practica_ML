Two-stage Sampling, Prediction and Adaptive Regression via Correlation
  Screening (SPARCS)
This paper proposes a general adaptive procedure for budget-limited predictor
design in high dimensions called two-stage Sampling, Prediction and Adaptive
Regression via Correlation Screening (SPARCS). SPARCS can be applied to high
dimensional prediction problems in experimental science, medicine, finance, and
engineering, as illustrated by the following. Suppose one wishes to run a
sequence of experiments to learn a sparse multivariate predictor of a dependent
variable $Y$ (disease prognosis for instance) based on a $p$ dimensional set of
independent variables $\mathbf X=[X_1,\ldots, X_p]^T$ (assayed biomarkers).
Assume that the cost of acquiring the full set of variables $\mathbf X$
increases linearly in its dimension. SPARCS breaks the data collection into two
stages in order to achieve an optimal tradeoff between sampling cost and
predictor performance. In the first stage we collect a few ($n$) expensive
samples $\{y_i,\mathbf x_i\}_{i=1}^n$, at the full dimension $p\gg n$ of
$\mathbf X$, winnowing the number of variables down to a smaller dimension $l <
p$ using a type of cross-correlation or regression coefficient screening. In
the second stage we collect a larger number $(t-n)$ of cheaper samples of the
$l$ variables that passed the screening of the first stage. At the second
stage, a low dimensional predictor is constructed by solving the standard
regression problem using all $t$ samples of the selected variables. SPARCS is
an adaptive online algorithm that implements false positive control on the
selected variables, is well suited to small sample sizes, and is scalable to
high dimensions. We establish asymptotic bounds for the Familywise Error Rate
(FWER), specify high dimensional convergence rates for support recovery, and
establish optimal sample allocation rules to the first and second stages.
