Implicitly Constrained Semi-Supervised Linear Discriminant Analysis
Semi-supervised learning is an important and active topic of research in
pattern recognition. For classification using linear discriminant analysis
specifically, several semi-supervised variants have been proposed. Using any
one of these methods is not guaranteed to outperform the supervised classifier
which does not take the additional unlabeled data into account. In this work we
compare traditional Expectation Maximization type approaches for
semi-supervised linear discriminant analysis with approaches based on intrinsic
constraints and propose a new principled approach for semi-supervised linear
discriminant analysis, using so-called implicit constraints. We explore the
relationships between these methods and consider the question if and in what
sense we can expect improvement in performance over the supervised procedure.
The constraint based approaches are more robust to misspecification of the
model, and may outperform alternatives that make more assumptions on the data,
in terms of the log-likelihood of unseen objects.
