Constraint-free Graphical Model with Fast Learning Algorithm
In this paper, we propose a simple, versatile model for learning the
structure and parameters of multivariate distributions from a data set.
Learning a Markov network from a given data set is not a simple problem,
because Markov networks rigorously represent Markov properties, and this rigor
imposes complex constraints on the design of the networks. Our proposed model
removes these constraints, acquiring important aspects from the information
geometry. The proposed parameter- and structure-learning algorithms are simple
to execute as they are based solely on local computation at each node.
Experiments demonstrate that our algorithms work appropriately.
