Distributed Multi-Task Learning with Shared Representation
We study the problem of distributed multi-task learning with shared
representation, where each machine aims to learn a separate, but related, task
in an unknown shared low-dimensional subspaces, i.e. when the predictor matrix
has low rank. We consider a setting where each task is handled by a different
machine, with samples for the task available locally on the machine, and study
communication-efficient methods for exploiting the shared structure.
