Research Priorities for Robust and Beneficial Artificial Intelligence
Success in the quest for artificial intelligence has the potential to bring
unprecedented benefits to humanity, and it is therefore worthwhile to
investigate how to maximize these benefits while avoiding potential pitfalls.
This article gives numerous examples (which should by no means be construed as
an exhaustive list) of such worthwhile research aimed at ensuring that AI
remains robust and beneficial.
