Ranking and combining multiple predictors without labeled data
In a broad range of classification and decision making problems, one is given
the advice or predictions of several classifiers, of unknown reliability, over
multiple questions or queries. This scenario is different from the standard
supervised setting, where each classifier accuracy can be assessed using
available labeled data, and raises two questions: given only the predictions of
several classifiers over a large set of unlabeled test data, is it possible to
a) reliably rank them; and b) construct a meta-classifier more accurate than
most classifiers in the ensemble? Here we present a novel spectral approach to
address these questions. First, assuming conditional independence between
classifiers, we show that the off-diagonal entries of their covariance matrix
correspond to a rank-one matrix. Moreover, the classifiers can be ranked using
the leading eigenvector of this covariance matrix, as its entries are
proportional to their balanced accuracies. Second, via a linear approximation
to the maximum likelihood estimator, we derive the Spectral Meta-Learner (SML),
a novel ensemble classifier whose weights are equal to this eigenvector
entries. On both simulated and real data, SML typically achieves a higher
accuracy than most classifiers in the ensemble and can provide a better
starting point than majority voting, for estimating the maximum likelihood
solution. Furthermore, SML is robust to the presence of small malicious groups
of classifiers designed to veer the ensemble prediction away from the (unknown)
ground truth.
