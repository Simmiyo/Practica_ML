Active Learning with Expert Advice
Conventional learning with expert advice methods assumes a learner is always
receiving the outcome (e.g., class labels) of every incoming training instance
at the end of each trial. In real applications, acquiring the outcome from
oracle can be costly or time consuming. In this paper, we address a new problem
of active learning with expert advice, where the outcome of an instance is
disclosed only when it is requested by the online learner. Our goal is to learn
an accurate prediction model by asking the oracle the number of questions as
small as possible. To address this challenge, we propose a framework of active
forecasters for online active learning with expert advice, which attempts to
extend two regular forecasters, i.e., Exponentially Weighted Average Forecaster
and Greedy Forecaster, to tackle the task of active learning with expert
advice. We prove that the proposed algorithms satisfy the Hannan consistency
under some proper assumptions, and validate the efficacy of our technique by an
extensive set of experiments.
