Automated Machine Learning on Big Data using Stochastic Algorithm Tuning
We introduce a means of automating machine learning (ML) for big data tasks,
by performing scalable stochastic Bayesian optimisation of ML algorithm
parameters and hyper-parameters. More often than not, the critical tuning of ML
algorithm parameters has relied on domain expertise from experts, along with
laborious hand-tuning, brute search or lengthy sampling runs. Against this
background, Bayesian optimisation is finding increasing use in automating
parameter tuning, making ML algorithms accessible even to non-experts. However,
the state of the art in Bayesian optimisation is incapable of scaling to the
large number of evaluations of algorithm performance required to fit realistic
models to complex, big data. We here describe a stochastic, sparse, Bayesian
optimisation strategy to solve this problem, using many thousands of noisy
evaluations of algorithm performance on subsets of data in order to effectively
train algorithms for big data. We provide a comprehensive benchmarking of
possible sparsification strategies for Bayesian optimisation, concluding that a
Nystrom approximation offers the best scaling and performance for real tasks.
Our proposed algorithm demonstrates substantial improvement over the state of
the art in tuning the parameters of a Gaussian Process time series prediction
task on real, big data.
