Regularizers for Structured Sparsity
We study the problem of learning a sparse linear regression vector under
additional conditions on the structure of its sparsity pattern. This problem is
relevant in machine learning, statistics and signal processing. It is well
known that a linear regression can benefit from knowledge that the underlying
regression vector is sparse. The combinatorial problem of selecting the nonzero
components of this vector can be "relaxed" by regularizing the squared error
with a convex penalty function like the $\ell_1$ norm. However, in many
applications, additional conditions on the structure of the regression vector
and its sparsity pattern are available. Incorporating this information into the
learning method may lead to a significant decrease of the estimation error. In
this paper, we present a family of convex penalty functions, which encode prior
knowledge on the structure of the vector formed by the absolute values of the
regression coefficients. This family subsumes the $\ell_1$ norm and is flexible
enough to include different models of sparsity patterns, which are of practical
and theoretical importance. We establish the basic properties of these penalty
functions and discuss some examples where they can be computed explicitly.
Moreover, we present a convergent optimization algorithm for solving
regularized least squares with these penalty functions. Numerical simulations
highlight the benefit of structured sparsity and the advantage offered by our
approach over the Lasso method and other related methods.
