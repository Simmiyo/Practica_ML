RSSL: Semi-supervised Learning in R
In this paper, we introduce a package for semi-supervised learning research
in the R programming language called RSSL. We cover the purpose of the package,
the methods it includes and comment on their use and implementation. We then
show, using several code examples, how the package can be used to replicate
well-known results from the semi-supervised learning literature.
