Sensor Selection by Linear Programming
We learn sensor trees from training data to minimize sensor acquisition costs
during test time. Our system adaptively selects sensors at each stage if
necessary to make a confident classification. We pose the problem as empirical
risk minimization over the choice of trees and node decision rules. We
decompose the problem, which is known to be intractable, into combinatorial
(tree structures) and continuous parts (node decision rules) and propose to
solve them separately. Using training data we greedily solve for the
combinatorial tree structures and for the continuous part, which is a
non-convex multilinear objective function, we derive convex surrogate loss
functions that are piecewise linear. The resulting problem can be cast as a
linear program and has the advantage of guaranteed convergence, global
optimality, repeatability and computational efficiency. We show that our
proposed approach outperforms the state-of-art on a number of benchmark
datasets.
