Minimum Density Hyperplanes
Associating distinct groups of objects (clusters) with contiguous regions of
high probability density (high-density clusters), is central to many
statistical and machine learning approaches to the classification of unlabelled
data. We propose a novel hyperplane classifier for clustering and
semi-supervised classification which is motivated by this objective. The
proposed minimum density hyperplane minimises the integral of the empirical
probability density function along it, thereby avoiding intersection with high
density clusters. We show that the minimum density and the maximum margin
hyperplanes are asymptotically equivalent, thus linking this approach to
maximum margin clustering and semi-supervised support vector classifiers. We
propose a projection pursuit formulation of the associated optimisation problem
which allows us to find minimum density hyperplanes efficiently in practice,
and evaluate its performance on a range of benchmark datasets. The proposed
approach is found to be very competitive with state of the art methods for
clustering and semi-supervised classification.
