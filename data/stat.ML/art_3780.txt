Discriminative Regularization for Generative Models
We explore the question of whether the representations learned by classifiers
can be used to enhance the quality of generative models. Our conjecture is that
labels correspond to characteristics of natural data which are most salient to
humans: identity in faces, objects in images, and utterances in speech. We
propose to take advantage of this by using the representations from
discriminative classifiers to augment the objective function corresponding to a
generative model. In particular we enhance the objective function of the
variational autoencoder, a popular generative model, with a discriminative
regularization term. We show that enhancing the objective function in this way
leads to samples that are clearer and have higher visual quality than the
samples from the standard variational autoencoders.
