Super-Samples from Kernel Herding
We extend the herding algorithm to continuous spaces by using the kernel
trick. The resulting "kernel herding" algorithm is an infinite memory
deterministic process that learns to approximate a PDF with a collection of
samples. We show that kernel herding decreases the error of expectations of
functions in the Hilbert space at a rate O(1/T) which is much faster than the
usual O(1/pT) for iid random samples. We illustrate kernel herding by
approximating Bayesian predictive distributions.
