Fano schemes of generic intersections and machine learning
We investigate Fano schemes of conditionally generic intersections, i.e. of
hypersurfaces in projective space chosen generically up to additional
conditions. Via a correspondence between generic properties of algebraic
varieties and events in probability spaces that occur with probability one, we
use the obtained results on Fano schemes to solve a problem in machine
learning.
