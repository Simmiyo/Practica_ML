Fast Prediction with SVM Models Containing RBF Kernels
We present an approximation scheme for support vector machine models that use
an RBF kernel. A second-order Maclaurin series approximation is used for
exponentials of inner products between support vectors and test instances. The
approximation is applicable to all kernel methods featuring sums of kernel
evaluations and makes no assumptions regarding data normalization. The
prediction speed of approximated models no longer relates to the amount of
support vectors but is quadratic in terms of the number of input dimensions. If
the number of input dimensions is small compared to the amount of support
vectors, the approximated model is significantly faster in prediction and has a
smaller memory footprint. An optimized C++ implementation was made to assess
the gain in prediction speed in a set of practical tests. We additionally
provide a method to verify the approximation accuracy, prior to training models
or during run-time, to ensure the loss in accuracy remains acceptable and
within known bounds.
