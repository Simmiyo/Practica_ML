Adaptive Reconfiguration Moves for Dirichlet Mixtures
Bayesian mixture models are widely applied for unsupervised learning and
exploratory data analysis. Markov chain Monte Carlo based on Gibbs sampling and
split-merge moves are widely used for inference in these models. However, both
methods are restricted to limited types of transitions and suffer from torpid
mixing and low accept rates even for problems of modest size. We propose a
method that considers a broader range of transitions that are close to
equilibrium by exploiting multiple chains in parallel and using the past states
adaptively to inform the proposal distribution. The method significantly
improves on Gibbs and split-merge sampling as quantified using convergence
diagnostics and acceptance rates. Adaptive MCMC methods which use past states
to inform the proposal distribution has given rise to many ingenious sampling
schemes for continuous problems and the present work can be seen as an
important first step in bringing these benefits to partition-based problems
