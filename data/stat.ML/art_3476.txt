Fast rates in statistical and online learning
The speed with which a learning algorithm converges as it is presented with
more data is a central problem in machine learning --- a fast rate of
convergence means less data is needed for the same level of performance. The
pursuit of fast rates in online and statistical learning has led to the
discovery of many conditions in learning theory under which fast learning is
possible. We show that most of these conditions are special cases of a single,
unifying condition, that comes in two forms: the central condition for 'proper'
learning algorithms that always output a hypothesis in the given model, and
stochastic mixability for online algorithms that may make predictions outside
of the model. We show that under surprisingly weak assumptions both conditions
are, in a certain sense, equivalent. The central condition has a
re-interpretation in terms of convexity of a set of pseudoprobabilities,
linking it to density estimation under misspecification. For bounded losses, we
show how the central condition enables a direct proof of fast rates and we
prove its equivalence to the Bernstein condition, itself a generalization of
the Tsybakov margin condition, both of which have played a central role in
obtaining fast rates in statistical learning. Yet, while the Bernstein
condition is two-sided, the central condition is one-sided, making it more
suitable to deal with unbounded losses. In its stochastic mixability form, our
condition generalizes both a stochastic exp-concavity condition identified by
Juditsky, Rigollet and Tsybakov and Vovk's notion of mixability. Our unifying
conditions thus provide a substantial step towards a characterization of fast
rates in statistical learning, similar to how classical mixability
characterizes constant regret in the sequential prediction with expert advice
setting.
