Application of multiview techniques to NHANES dataset
Disease prediction or classification using health datasets involve using
well-known predictors associated with the disease as features for the models.
This study considers multiple data components of an individual's health, using
the relationship between variables to generate features that may improve the
performance of disease classification models. In order to capture information
from different aspects of the data, this project uses a multiview learning
approach, using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), a technique that finds
projections with maximum correlations between two data views. Data categories
collected from the NHANES survey (1999-2014) are used as views to learn the
multiview representations. The usefulness of the representations is
demonstrated by applying them as features in a Diabetes classification task.
