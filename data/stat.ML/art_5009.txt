Private Topic Modeling
We develop a privatised stochastic variational inference method for Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The iterative nature of stochastic variational
inference presents challenges: multiple iterations are required to obtain
accurate posterior distributions, yet each iteration increases the amount of
noise that must be added to achieve a reasonable degree of privacy. We propose
a practical algorithm that overcomes this challenge by combining: (1) an
improved composition method for differential privacy, called the moments
accountant, which provides a tight bound on the privacy cost of multiple
variational inference iterations and thus significantly decreases the amount of
additive noise; and (2) privacy amplification resulting from subsampling of
large-scale data. Focusing on conjugate exponential family models, in our
private variational inference, all the posterior distributions will be
privatised by simply perturbing expected sufficient statistics. Using Wikipedia
data, we illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm for large-scale data.
