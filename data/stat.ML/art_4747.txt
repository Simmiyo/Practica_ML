Bounds for Vector-Valued Function Estimation
We present a framework to derive risk bounds for vector-valued learning with
a broad class of feature maps and loss functions. Multi-task learning and
one-vs-all multi-category learning are treated as examples. We discuss in
detail vector-valued functions with one hidden layer, and demonstrate that the
conditions under which shared representations are beneficial for multi- task
learning are equally applicable to multi-category learning.
