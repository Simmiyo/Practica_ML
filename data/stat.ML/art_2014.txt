Statistical Consistency of Finite-dimensional Unregularized Linear
  Classification
This manuscript studies statistical properties of linear classifiers obtained
through minimization of an unregularized convex risk over a finite sample.
Although the results are explicitly finite-dimensional, inputs may be passed
through feature maps; in this way, in addition to treating the consistency of
logistic regression, this analysis also handles boosting over a finite weak
learning class with, for instance, the exponential, logistic, and hinge losses.
In this finite-dimensional setting, it is still possible to fit arbitrary
decision boundaries: scaling the complexity of the weak learning class with the
sample size leads to the optimal classification risk almost surely.
