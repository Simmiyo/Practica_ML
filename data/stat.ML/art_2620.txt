Constrained Bayesian Inference for Low Rank Multitask Learning
We present a novel approach for constrained Bayesian inference. Unlike
current methods, our approach does not require convexity of the constraint set.
We reduce the constrained variational inference to a parametric optimization
over the feasible set of densities and propose a general recipe for such
problems. We apply the proposed constrained Bayesian inference approach to
multitask learning subject to rank constraints on the weight matrix. Further,
constrained parameter estimation is applied to recover the sparse conditional
independence structure encoded by prior precision matrices. Our approach is
motivated by reverse inference for high dimensional functional neuroimaging, a
domain where the high dimensionality and small number of examples requires the
use of constraints to ensure meaningful and effective models. For this
application, we propose a model that jointly learns a weight matrix and the
prior inverse covariance structure between different tasks. We present
experimental validation showing that the proposed approach outperforms strong
baseline models in terms of predictive performance and structure recovery.
