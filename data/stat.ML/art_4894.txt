Using Kernel Methods and Model Selection for Prediction of Preterm Birth
We describe an application of machine learning to the problem of predicting
preterm birth. We conduct a secondary analysis on a clinical trial dataset
collected by the National In- stitute of Child Health and Human Development
(NICHD) while focusing our attention on predicting different classes of preterm
birth. We compare three approaches for deriving predictive models: a support
vector machine (SVM) approach with linear and non-linear kernels, logistic
regression with different model selection along with a model based on decision
rules prescribed by physician experts for prediction of preterm birth. Our
approach highlights the pre-processing methods applied to handle the inherent
dynamics, noise and gaps in the data and describe techniques used to handle
skewed class distributions. Empirical experiments demonstrate significant
improvement in predicting preterm birth compared to past work.
