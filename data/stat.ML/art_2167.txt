Maximum Margin Bayesian Networks
We consider the problem of learning Bayesian network classifiers that
maximize the marginover a set of classification variables. We find that this
problem is harder for Bayesian networks than for undirected graphical models
like maximum margin Markov networks. The main difficulty is that the parameters
in a Bayesian network must satisfy additional normalization constraints that an
undirected graphical model need not respect. These additional constraints
complicate the optimization task. Nevertheless, we derive an effective training
algorithm that solves the maximum margin training problem for a range of
Bayesian network topologies, and converges to an approximate solution for
arbitrary network topologies. Experimental results show that the method can
demonstrate improved generalization performance over Markov networks when the
directed graphical structure encodes relevant knowledge. In practice, the
training technique allows one to combine prior knowledge expressed as a
directed (causal) model with state of the art discriminative learning methods.
