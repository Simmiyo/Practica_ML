Low Data Drug Discovery with One-shot Learning
Recent advances in machine learning have made significant contributions to
drug discovery. Deep neural networks in particular have been demonstrated to
provide significant boosts in predictive power when inferring the properties
and activities of small-molecule compounds. However, the applicability of these
techniques has been limited by the requirement for large amounts of training
data. In this work, we demonstrate how one-shot learning can be used to
significantly lower the amounts of data required to make meaningful predictions
in drug discovery applications. We introduce a new architecture, the residual
LSTM embedding, that, when combined with graph convolutional neural networks,
significantly improves the ability to learn meaningful distance metrics over
small-molecules. We open source all models introduced in this work as part of
DeepChem, an open-source framework for deep-learning in drug discovery.
