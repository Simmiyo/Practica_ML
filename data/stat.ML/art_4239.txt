autoBagging: Learning to Rank Bagging Workflows with Metalearning
Machine Learning (ML) has been successfully applied to a wide range of
domains and applications. One of the techniques behind most of these successful
applications is Ensemble Learning (EL), the field of ML that gave birth to
methods such as Random Forests or Boosting. The complexity of applying these
techniques together with the market scarcity on ML experts, has created the
need for systems that enable a fast and easy drop-in replacement for ML
libraries. Automated machine learning (autoML) is the field of ML that attempts
to answers these needs. Typically, these systems rely on optimization
techniques such as bayesian optimization to lead the search for the best model.
Our approach differs from these systems by making use of the most recent
advances on metalearning and a learning to rank approach to learn from
metadata. We propose autoBagging, an autoML system that automatically ranks 63
bagging workflows by exploiting past performance and dataset characterization.
Results on 140 classification datasets from the OpenML platform show that
autoBagging can yield better performance than the Average Rank method and
achieve results that are not statistically different from an ideal model that
systematically selects the best workflow for each dataset. For the purpose of
reproducibility and generalizability, autoBagging is publicly available as an R
package on CRAN.
