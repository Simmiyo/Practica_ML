PCA-Initialized Deep Neural Networks Applied To Document Image Analysis
In this paper, we present a novel approach for initializing deep neural
networks, i.e., by turning PCA into neural layers. Usually, the initialization
of the weights of a deep neural network is done in one of the three following
ways: 1) with random values, 2) layer-wise, usually as Deep Belief Network or
as auto-encoder, and 3) re-use of layers from another network (transfer
learning). Therefore, typically, many training epochs are needed before
meaningful weights are learned, or a rather similar dataset is required for
seeding a fine-tuning of transfer learning. In this paper, we describe how to
turn a PCA into an auto-encoder, by generating an encoder layer of the PCA
parameters and furthermore adding a decoding layer. We analyze the
initialization technique on real documents. First, we show that a PCA-based
initialization is quick and leads to a very stable initialization. Furthermore,
for the task of layout analysis we investigate the effectiveness of PCA-based
initialization and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art random weight
initialization methods.
