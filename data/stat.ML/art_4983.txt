Peacock Bundles: Bundle Coloring for Graphs with Globality-Locality
  Trade-off
Bundling of graph edges (node-to-node connections) is a common technique to
enhance visibility of overall trends in the edge structure of a large graph
layout, and a large variety of bundling algorithms have been proposed. However,
with strong bundling, it becomes hard to identify origins and destinations of
individual edges. We propose a solution: we optimize edge coloring to
differentiate bundled edges. We quantify strength of bundling in a flexible
pairwise fashion between edges, and among bundled edges, we quantify how
dissimilar their colors should be by dissimilarity of their origins and
destinations. We solve the resulting nonlinear optimization, which is also
interpretable as a novel dimensionality reduction task. In large graphs the
necessary compromise is whether to differentiate colors sharply between locally
occurring strongly bundled edges ("local bundles"), or also between the weakly
bundled edges occurring globally over the graph ("global bundles"); we allow a
user-set global-local tradeoff. We call the technique "peacock bundles".
Experiments show the coloring clearly enhances comprehensibility of graph
layouts with edge bundling.
