liquidSVM: A Fast and Versatile SVM package
liquidSVM is a package written in C++ that provides SVM-type solvers for
various classification and regression tasks. Because of a fully integrated
hyper-parameter selection, very carefully implemented solvers, multi-threading
and GPU support, and several built-in data decomposition strategies it provides
unprecedented speed for small training sizes as well as for data sets of tens
of millions of samples. Besides the C++ API and a command line interface,
bindings to R, MATLAB, Java, Python, and Spark are available. We present a
brief description of the package and report experimental comparisons to other
SVM packages.
