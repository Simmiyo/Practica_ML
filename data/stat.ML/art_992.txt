Calibration of One-Class SVM for MV set estimation
A general approach for anomaly detection or novelty detection consists in
estimating high density regions or Minimum Volume (MV) sets. The One-Class
Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) is a state-of-the-art algorithm for estimating
such regions from high dimensional data. Yet it suffers from practical
limitations. When applied to a limited number of samples it can lead to poor
performance even when picking the best hyperparameters. Moreover the solution
of OCSVM is very sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which makes it
hard to optimize in an unsupervised setting. We present a new approach to
estimate MV sets using the OCSVM with a different choice of the parameter
controlling the proportion of outliers. The solution function of the OCSVM is
learnt on a training set and the desired probability mass is obtained by
adjusting the offset on a test set to prevent overfitting. Models learnt on
different train/test splits are then aggregated to reduce the variance induced
by such random splits. Our approach makes it possible to tune the
hyperparameters automatically and obtain nested set estimates. Experimental
results show that our approach outperforms the standard OCSVM formulation while
suffering less from the curse of dimensionality than kernel density estimates.
Results on actual data sets are also presented.
