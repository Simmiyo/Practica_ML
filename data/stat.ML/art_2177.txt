Polarimetric SAR Image Segmentation with B-Splines and a New Statistical
  Model
We present an approach for polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image
region boundary detection based on the use of B-Spline active contours and a
new model for polarimetric SAR data: the GHP distribution. In order to detect
the boundary of a region, initial B-Spline curves are specified, either
automatically or manually, and the proposed algorithm uses a deformable
contours technique to find the boundary. In doing this, the parameters of the
polarimetric GHP model for the data are estimated, in order to find the
transition points between the region being segmented and the surrounding area.
This is a local algorithm since it works only on the region to be segmented.
Results of its performance are presented.
