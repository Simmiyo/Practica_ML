Interpretable Two-level Boolean Rule Learning for Classification
As a contribution to interpretable machine learning research, we develop a
novel optimization framework for learning accurate and sparse two-level Boolean
rules. We consider rules in both conjunctive normal form (AND-of-ORs) and
disjunctive normal form (OR-of-ANDs). A principled objective function is
proposed to trade classification accuracy and interpretability, where we use
Hamming loss to characterize accuracy and sparsity to characterize
interpretability. We propose efficient procedures to optimize these objectives
based on linear programming (LP) relaxation, block coordinate descent, and
alternating minimization. Experiments show that our new algorithms provide very
good tradeoffs between accuracy and interpretability.
