Discriminative models for robust image classification
A variety of real-world tasks involve the classification of images into
pre-determined categories. Designing image classification algorithms that
exhibit robustness to acquisition noise and image distortions, particularly
when the available training data are insufficient to learn accurate models, is
a significant challenge. This dissertation explores the development of
discriminative models for robust image classification that exploit underlying
signal structure, via probabilistic graphical models and sparse signal
representations.
  Probabilistic graphical models are widely used in many applications to
approximate high-dimensional data in a reduced complexity set-up. Learning
graphical structures to approximate probability distributions is an area of
active research. Recent work has focused on learning graphs in a discriminative
manner with the goal of minimizing classification error. In the first part of
the dissertation, we develop a discriminative learning framework that exploits
the complementary yet correlated information offered by multiple
representations (or projections) of a given signal/image. Specifically, we
propose a discriminative tree-based scheme for feature fusion by explicitly
learning the conditional correlations among such multiple projections in an
iterative manner. Experiments reveal the robustness of the resulting graphical
model classifier to training insufficiency.
