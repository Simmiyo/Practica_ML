Bayesian Nonparametric Crowdsourcing
Crowdsourcing has been proven to be an effective and efficient tool to
annotate large datasets. User annotations are often noisy, so methods to
combine the annotations to produce reliable estimates of the ground truth are
necessary. We claim that considering the existence of clusters of users in this
combination step can improve the performance. This is especially important in
early stages of crowdsourcing implementations, where the number of annotations
is low. At this stage there is not enough information to accurately estimate
the bias introduced by each annotator separately, so we have to resort to
models that consider the statistical links among them. In addition, finding
these clusters is interesting in itself as knowing the behavior of the pool of
annotators allows implementing efficient active learning strategies. Based on
this, we propose in this paper two new fully unsupervised models based on a
Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP) prior and a hierarchical structure that allows
inferring these groups jointly with the ground truth and the properties of the
users. Efficient inference algorithms based on Gibbs sampling with auxiliary
variables are proposed. Finally, we perform experiments, both on synthetic and
real databases, to show the advantages of our models over state-of-the-art
algorithms.
