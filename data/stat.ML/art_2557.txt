Controlling the Precision-Recall Tradeoff in Differential Dependency
  Network Analysis
Graphical models have gained a lot of attention recently as a tool for
learning and representing dependencies among variables in multivariate data.
Often, domain scientists are looking specifically for differences among the
dependency networks of different conditions or populations (e.g. differences
between regulatory networks of different species, or differences between
dependency networks of diseased versus healthy populations). The standard
method for finding these differences is to learn the dependency networks for
each condition independently and compare them. We show that this approach is
prone to high false discovery rates (low precision) that can render the
analysis useless. We then show that by imposing a bias towards learning similar
dependency networks for each condition the false discovery rates can be reduced
to acceptable levels, at the cost of finding a reduced number of differences.
Algorithms developed in the transfer learning literature can be used to vary
the strength of the imposed similarity bias and provide a natural mechanism to
smoothly adjust this differential precision-recall tradeoff to cater to the
requirements of the analysis conducted. We present real case studies
(oncological and neurological) where domain experts use the proposed technique
to extract useful differential networks that shed light on the biological
processes involved in cancer and brain function.
