The Lovász Hinge: A Novel Convex Surrogate for Submodular Losses
Learning with non-modular losses is an important problem when sets of
predictions are made simultaneously. The main tools for constructing convex
surrogate loss functions for set prediction are margin rescaling and slack
rescaling. In this work, we show that these strategies lead to tight convex
surrogates iff the underlying loss function is increasing in the number of
incorrect predictions. However, gradient or cutting-plane computation for these
functions is NP-hard for non-supermodular loss functions. We propose instead a
novel surrogate loss function for submodular losses, the Lov\'asz hinge, which
leads to O(p log p) complexity with O(p) oracle accesses to the loss function
to compute a gradient or cutting-plane. We prove that the Lov\'asz hinge is
convex and yields an extension. As a result, we have developed the first
tractable convex surrogates in the literature for submodular losses. We
demonstrate the utility of this novel convex surrogate through several set
prediction tasks, including on the PASCAL VOC and Microsoft COCO datasets.
