A Bayesian Approach to Sparse plus Low rank Network Identification
We consider the problem of modeling multivariate time series with
parsimonious dynamical models which can be represented as sparse dynamic
Bayesian networks with few latent nodes. This structure translates into a
sparse plus low rank model. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian regression
approach to identify such a model.
