Clustered regression with unknown clusters
We consider a collection of prediction experiments, which are clustered in
the sense that groups of experiments ex- hibit similar relationship between the
predictor and response variables. The experiment clusters as well as the
regres- sion relationships are unknown. The regression relation- ships define
the experiment clusters, and in general, the predictor and response variables
may not exhibit any clus- tering. We call this prediction problem clustered
regres- sion with unknown clusters (CRUC) and in this paper we focus on linear
regression. We study and compare several methods for CRUC, demonstrate their
applicability to the Yahoo Learning-to-rank Challenge (YLRC) dataset, and in-
vestigate an associated mathematical model. CRUC is at the crossroads of many
prior works and we study several prediction algorithms with diverse origins: an
adaptation of the expectation-maximization algorithm, an approach in- spired by
K-means clustering, the singular value threshold- ing approach to matrix rank
minimization under quadratic constraints, an adaptation of the Curds and Whey
method in multiple regression, and a local regression (LoR) scheme reminiscent
of neighborhood methods in collaborative filter- ing. Based on empirical
evaluation on the YLRC dataset as well as simulated data, we identify the LoR
method as a good practical choice: it yields best or near-best prediction
performance at a reasonable computational load, and it is less sensitive to the
choice of the algorithm parameter. We also provide some analysis of the LoR
method for an asso- ciated mathematical model, which sheds light on optimal
parameter choice and prediction performance.
