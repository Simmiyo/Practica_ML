Methods for Interpreting and Understanding Deep Neural Networks
This paper provides an entry point to the problem of interpreting a deep
neural network model and explaining its predictions. It is based on a tutorial
given at ICASSP 2017. It introduces some recently proposed techniques of
interpretation, along with theory, tricks and recommendations, to make most
efficient use of these techniques on real data. It also discusses a number of
practical applications.
