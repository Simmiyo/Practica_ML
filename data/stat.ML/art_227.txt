Variational Inference in Nonconjugate Models
Mean-field variational methods are widely used for approximate posterior
inference in many probabilistic models. In a typical application, mean-field
methods approximately compute the posterior with a coordinate-ascent
optimization algorithm. When the model is conditionally conjugate, the
coordinate updates are easily derived and in closed form. However, many models
of interest---like the correlated topic model and Bayesian logistic
regression---are nonconjuate. In these models, mean-field methods cannot be
directly applied and practitioners have had to develop variational algorithms
on a case-by-case basis. In this paper, we develop two generic methods for
nonconjugate models, Laplace variational inference and delta method variational
inference. Our methods have several advantages: they allow for easily derived
variational algorithms with a wide class of nonconjugate models; they extend
and unify some of the existing algorithms that have been derived for specific
models; and they work well on real-world datasets. We studied our methods on
the correlated topic model, Bayesian logistic regression, and hierarchical
Bayesian logistic regression.
