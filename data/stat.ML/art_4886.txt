On the Use of Sparse Filtering for Covariate Shift Adaptation
In this paper we formally analyse the use of sparse filtering algorithms to
perform covariate shift adaptation. We provide a theoretical analysis of sparse
filtering by evaluating the conditions required to perform covariate shift
adaptation. We prove that sparse filtering can perform adaptation only if the
conditional distribution of the labels has a structure explained by a cosine
metric. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new algorithm, named periodic
sparse filtering, and carry out the same theoretical analysis regarding
covariate shift adaptation. We show that periodic sparse filtering can perform
adaptation under the looser and more realistic requirement that the conditional
distribution of the labels has a periodic structure, which may be satisfied,
for instance, by user-dependent data sets. We experimentally validate our
theoretical results on synthetic data. Moreover, we apply periodic sparse
filtering to real-world data sets to demonstrate that this simple and
computationally efficient algorithm is able to achieve competitive
performances.
