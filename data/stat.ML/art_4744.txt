Robust Ensemble Clustering Using Probability Trajectories
Although many successful ensemble clustering approaches have been developed
in recent years, there are still two limitations to most of the existing
approaches. First, they mostly overlook the issue of uncertain links, which may
mislead the overall consensus process. Second, they generally lack the ability
to incorporate global information to refine the local links. To address these
two limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel ensemble clustering approach
based on sparse graph representation and probability trajectory analysis. In
particular, we present the elite neighbor selection strategy to identify the
uncertain links by locally adaptive thresholds and build a sparse graph with a
small number of probably reliable links. We argue that a small number of
probably reliable links can lead to significantly better consensus results than
using all graph links regardless of their reliability. The random walk process
driven by a new transition probability matrix is utilized to explore the global
information in the graph. We derive a novel and dense similarity measure from
the sparse graph by analyzing the probability trajectories of the random
walkers, based on which two consensus functions are further proposed.
Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.
