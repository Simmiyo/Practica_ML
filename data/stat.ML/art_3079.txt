A totally unimodular view of structured sparsity
This paper describes a simple framework for structured sparse recovery based
on convex optimization. We show that many structured sparsity models can be
naturally represented by linear matrix inequalities on the support of the
unknown parameters, where the constraint matrix has a totally unimodular (TU)
structure. For such structured models, tight convex relaxations can be obtained
in polynomial time via linear programming. Our modeling framework unifies the
prevalent structured sparsity norms in the literature, introduces new
interesting ones, and renders their tightness and tractability arguments
transparent.
