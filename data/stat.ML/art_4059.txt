Spectral Convolution Networks
Previous research has shown that computation of convolution in the frequency
domain provides a significant speedup versus traditional convolution network
implementations. However, this performance increase comes at the expense of
repeatedly computing the transform and its inverse in order to apply other
network operations such as activation, pooling, and dropout. We show,
mathematically, how convolution and activation can both be implemented in the
frequency domain using either the Fourier or Laplace transformation. The main
contributions are a description of spectral activation under the Fourier
transform and a further description of an efficient algorithm for computing
both convolution and activation under the Laplace transform. By computing both
the convolution and activation functions in the frequency domain, we can reduce
the number of transforms required, as well as reducing overall complexity. Our
description of a spectral activation function, together with existing spectral
analogs of other network functions may then be used to compose a fully spectral
implementation of a convolution network.
