Consistent Classification Algorithms for Multi-class Non-Decomposable
  Performance Metrics
We study consistency of learning algorithms for a multi-class performance
metric that is a non-decomposable function of the confusion matrix of a
classifier and cannot be expressed as a sum of losses on individual data
points; examples of such performance metrics include the macro F-measure
popular in information retrieval and the G-mean metric used in class-imbalanced
problems. While there has been much work in recent years in understanding the
consistency properties of learning algorithms for `binary' non-decomposable
metrics, little is known either about the form of the optimal classifier for a
general multi-class non-decomposable metric, or about how these learning
algorithms generalize to the multi-class case. In this paper, we provide a
unified framework for analysing a multi-class non-decomposable performance
metric, where the problem of finding the optimal classifier for the performance
metric is viewed as an optimization problem over the space of all confusion
matrices achievable under the given distribution. Using this framework, we show
that (under a continuous distribution) the optimal classifier for a multi-class
performance metric can be obtained as the solution of a cost-sensitive
classification problem, thus generalizing several previous results on specific
binary non-decomposable metrics. We then design a consistent learning algorithm
for concave multi-class performance metrics that proceeds via a sequence of
cost-sensitive classification problems, and can be seen as applying the
conditional gradient (CG) optimization method over the space of feasible
confusion matrices. To our knowledge, this is the first efficient learning
algorithm (whose running time is polynomial in the number of classes) that is
consistent for a large family of multi-class non-decomposable metrics. Our
consistency proof uses a novel technique based on the convergence analysis of
the CG method.
