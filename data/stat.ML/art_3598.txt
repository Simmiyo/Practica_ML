Exclusive Sparsity Norm Minimization with Random Groups via Cone
  Projection
Many practical applications such as gene expression analysis, multi-task
learning, image recognition, signal processing, and medical data analysis
pursue a sparse solution for the feature selection purpose and particularly
favor the nonzeros \emph{evenly} distributed in different groups. The exclusive
sparsity norm has been widely used to serve to this purpose. However, it still
lacks systematical studies for exclusive sparsity norm optimization. This paper
offers two main contributions from the optimization perspective: 1) We provide
several efficient algorithms to solve exclusive sparsity norm minimization with
either smooth loss or hinge loss (non-smooth loss). All algorithms achieve the
optimal convergence rate $O(1/k^2)$ ($k$ is the iteration number). To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first time to guarantee such convergence rate for
the general exclusive sparsity norm minimization; 2) When the group information
is unavailable to define the exclusive sparsity norm, we propose to use the
random grouping scheme to construct groups and prove that if the number of
groups is appropriately chosen, the nonzeros (true features) would be grouped
in the ideal way with high probability. Empirical studies validate the
efficiency of proposed algorithms, and the effectiveness of random grouping
scheme on the proposed exclusive SVM formulation.
