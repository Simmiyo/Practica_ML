Metrics for Probabilistic Geometries
We investigate the geometrical structure of probabilistic generative
dimensionality reduction models using the tools of Riemannian geometry. We
explicitly define a distribution over the natural metric given by the models.
We provide the necessary algorithms to compute expected metric tensors where
the distribution over mappings is given by a Gaussian process. We treat the
corresponding latent variable model as a Riemannian manifold and we use the
expectation of the metric under the Gaussian process prior to define
interpolating paths and measure distance between latent points. We show how
distances that respect the expected metric lead to more appropriate generation
of new data.
