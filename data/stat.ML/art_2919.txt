Inferring latent structures via information inequalities
One of the goals of probabilistic inference is to decide whether an
empirically observed distribution is compatible with a candidate Bayesian
network. However, Bayesian networks with hidden variables give rise to highly
non-trivial constraints on the observed distribution. Here, we propose an
information-theoretic approach, based on the insight that conditions on
entropies of Bayesian networks take the form of simple linear inequalities. We
describe an algorithm for deriving entropic tests for latent structures. The
well-known conditional independence tests appear as a special case. While the
approach applies for generic Bayesian networks, we presently adopt the causal
view, and show the versatility of the framework by treating several relevant
problems from that domain: detecting common ancestors, quantifying the strength
of causal influence, and inferring the direction of causation from two-variable
marginals.
