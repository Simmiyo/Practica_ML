A Reduction of the Elastic Net to Support Vector Machines with an
  Application to GPU Computing
The past years have witnessed many dedicated open-source projects that built
and maintain implementations of Support Vector Machines (SVM), parallelized for
GPU, multi-core CPUs and distributed systems. Up to this point, no comparable
effort has been made to parallelize the Elastic Net, despite its popularity in
many high impact applications, including genetics, neuroscience and systems
biology. The first contribution in this paper is of theoretical nature. We
establish a tight link between two seemingly different algorithms and prove
that Elastic Net regression can be reduced to SVM with squared hinge loss
classification. Our second contribution is to derive a practical algorithm
based on this reduction. The reduction enables us to utilize prior efforts in
speeding up and parallelizing SVMs to obtain a highly optimized and parallel
solver for the Elastic Net and Lasso. With a simple wrapper, consisting of only
11 lines of MATLAB code, we obtain an Elastic Net implementation that naturally
utilizes GPU and multi-core CPUs. We demonstrate on twelve real world data
sets, that our algorithm yields identical results as the popular (and highly
optimized) glmnet implementation but is one or several orders of magnitude
faster.
