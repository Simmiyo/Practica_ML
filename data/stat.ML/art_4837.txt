Efficient and Consistent Robust Time Series Analysis
We study the problem of robust time series analysis under the standard
auto-regressive (AR) time series model in the presence of arbitrary outliers.
We devise an efficient hard thresholding based algorithm which can obtain a
consistent estimate of the optimal AR model despite a large fraction of the
time series points being corrupted. Our algorithm alternately estimates the
corrupted set of points and the model parameters, and is inspired by recent
advances in robust regression and hard-thresholding methods. However, a direct
application of existing techniques is hindered by a critical difference in the
time-series domain: each point is correlated with all previous points rendering
existing tools inapplicable directly. We show how to overcome this hurdle using
novel proof techniques. Using our techniques, we are also able to provide the
first efficient and provably consistent estimator for the robust regression
problem where a standard linear observation model with white additive noise is
corrupted arbitrarily. We illustrate our methods on synthetic datasets and show
that our methods indeed are able to consistently recover the optimal parameters
despite a large fraction of points being corrupted.
