A Review of Feature Selection Methods Based on Mutual Information
In this work we present a review of the state of the art of information
theoretic feature selection methods. The concepts of feature relevance,
redundance and complementarity (synergy) are clearly defined, as well as Markov
blanket. The problem of optimal feature selection is defined. A unifying
theoretical framework is described, which can retrofit successful heuristic
criteria, indicating the approximations made by each method. A number of open
problems in the field are presented.
