GraphPrints: Towards a Graph Analytic Method for Network Anomaly
  Detection
This paper introduces a novel graph-analytic approach for detecting anomalies
in network flow data called GraphPrints. Building on foundational
network-mining techniques, our method represents time slices of traffic as a
graph, then counts graphlets -- small induced subgraphs that describe local
topology. By performing outlier detection on the sequence of graphlet counts,
anomalous intervals of traffic are identified, and furthermore, individual IPs
experiencing abnormal behavior are singled-out. Initial testing of GraphPrints
is performed on real network data with an implanted anomaly. Evaluation shows
false positive rates bounded by 2.84% at the time-interval level, and 0.05% at
the IP-level with 100% true positive rates at both.
