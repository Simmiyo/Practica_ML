When Crowdsourcing Meets Mobile Sensing: A Social Network Perspective
Mobile sensing is an emerging technology that utilizes agent-participatory
data for decision making or state estimation, including multimedia
applications. This article investigates the structure of mobile sensing schemes
and introduces crowdsourcing methods for mobile sensing. Inspired by social
network, one can establish trust among participatory agents to leverage the
wisdom of crowds for mobile sensing. A prototype of social network inspired
mobile multimedia and sensing application is presented for illustrative
purpose. Numerical experiments on real-world datasets show improved performance
of mobile sensing via crowdsourcing. Challenges for mobile sensing with respect
to Internet layers are discussed.
