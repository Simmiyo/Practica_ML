Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Random Walks on Target Labelings
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (DA) is used to automatize the task of
labeling data: an unlabeled dataset (target) is annotated using a labeled
dataset (source) from a related domain. We cast domain adaptation as the
problem of finding stable labels for target examples. A new definition of label
stability is proposed, motivated by a generalization error bound for large
margin linear classifiers: a target labeling is stable when, with high
probability, a classifier trained on a random subsample of the target with that
labeling yields the same labeling. We find stable labelings using a random walk
on a directed graph with transition probabilities based on labeling stability.
The majority vote of those labelings visited by the walk yields a stable label
for each target example. The resulting domain adaptation algorithm is
strikingly easy to implement and apply: It does not rely on data
transformations, which are in general computational prohibitive in the presence
of many input features, and does not need to access the source data, which is
advantageous when data sharing is restricted. By acting on the original feature
space, our method is able to take full advantage of deep features from external
pre-trained neural networks, as demonstrated by the results of our experiments.
