Finding Exogenous Variables in Data with Many More Variables than
  Observations
Many statistical methods have been proposed to estimate causal models in
classical situations with fewer variables than observations (p<n, p: the number
of variables and n: the number of observations). However, modern datasets
including gene expression data need high-dimensional causal modeling in
challenging situations with orders of magnitude more variables than
observations (p>>n). In this paper, we propose a method to find exogenous
variables in a linear non-Gaussian causal model, which requires much smaller
sample sizes than conventional methods and works even when p>>n. The key idea
is to identify which variables are exogenous based on non-Gaussianity instead
of estimating the entire structure of the model. Exogenous variables work as
triggers that activate a causal chain in the model, and their identification
leads to more efficient experimental designs and better understanding of the
causal mechanism. We present experiments with artificial data and real-world
gene expression data to evaluate the method.
