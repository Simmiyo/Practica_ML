Multi-View Factorization Machines
For a learning task, data can usually be collected from different sources or
be represented from multiple views. For example, laboratory results from
different medical examinations are available for disease diagnosis, and each of
them can only reflect the health state of a person from a particular
aspect/view. Therefore, different views provide complementary information for
learning tasks. An effective integration of the multi-view information is
expected to facilitate the learning performance. In this paper, we propose a
general predictor, named multi-view machines (MVMs), that can effectively
include all the possible interactions between features from multiple views. A
joint factorization is embedded for the full-order interaction parameters which
allows parameter estimation under sparsity. Moreover, MVMs can work in
conjunction with different loss functions for a variety of machine learning
tasks. A stochastic gradient descent method is presented to learn the MVM
model. We further illustrate the advantages of MVMs through comparison with
other methods for multi-view classification, including support vector machines
(SVMs), support tensor machines (STMs) and factorization machines (FMs).
