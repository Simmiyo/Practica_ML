Safe Sample Screening for Support Vector Machines
Sparse classifiers such as the support vector machines (SVM) are efficient in
test-phases because the classifier is characterized only by a subset of the
samples called support vectors (SVs), and the rest of the samples (non SVs)
have no influence on the classification result. However, the advantage of the
sparsity has not been fully exploited in training phases because it is
generally difficult to know which sample turns out to be SV beforehand. In this
paper, we introduce a new approach called safe sample screening that enables us
to identify a subset of the non-SVs and screen them out prior to the training
phase. Our approach is different from existing heuristic approaches in the
sense that the screened samples are guaranteed to be non-SVs at the optimal
solution. We investigate the advantage of the safe sample screening approach
through intensive numerical experiments, and demonstrate that it can
substantially decrease the computational cost of the state-of-the-art SVM
solvers such as LIBSVM. In the current big data era, we believe that safe
sample screening would be of great practical importance since the data size can
be reduced without sacrificing the optimality of the final solution.
