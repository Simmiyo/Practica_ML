Compressive Embedding and Visualization using Graphs
Visualizing high-dimensional data has been a focus in data analysis
communities for decades, which has led to the design of many algorithms, some
of which are now considered references (such as t-SNE for example). In our era
of overwhelming data volumes, the scalability of such methods have become more
and more important. In this work, we present a method which allows to apply any
visualization or embedding algorithm on very large datasets by considering only
a fraction of the data as input and then extending the information to all data
points using a graph encoding its global similarity. We show that in most
cases, using only $\mathcal{O}(\log(N))$ samples is sufficient to diffuse the
information to all $N$ data points. In addition, we propose quantitative
methods to measure the quality of embeddings and demonstrate the validity of
our technique on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
