Thompson Sampling: An Asymptotically Optimal Finite Time Analysis
The question of the optimality of Thompson Sampling for solving the
stochastic multi-armed bandit problem had been open since 1933. In this paper
we answer it positively for the case of Bernoulli rewards by providing the
first finite-time analysis that matches the asymptotic rate given in the Lai
and Robbins lower bound for the cumulative regret. The proof is accompanied by
a numerical comparison with other optimal policies, experiments that have been
lacking in the literature until now for the Bernoulli case.
