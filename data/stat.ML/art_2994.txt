Sparse Additive Model using Symmetric Nonnegative Definite Smoothers
We introduce a new algorithm, called adaptive sparse backfitting algorithm,
for solving high dimensional Sparse Additive Model (SpAM) utilizing symmetric,
non-negative definite smoothers. Unlike the previous sparse backfitting
algorithm, our method is essentially a block coordinate descent algorithm that
guarantees to converge to the optimal solution. It bridges the gap between the
population backfitting algorithm and that of the data version. We also prove
variable selection consistency under suitable conditions. Numerical studies on
both synthesis and real data are conducted to show that adaptive sparse
backfitting algorithm outperforms previous sparse backfitting algorithm in
fitting and predicting high dimensional nonparametric models.
