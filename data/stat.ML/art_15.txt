Testing for Homogeneity with Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis
We propose to investigate test statistics for testing homogeneity in
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Asymptotic null distributions under null
hypothesis are derived, and consistency against fixed and local alternatives is
assessed. Finally, experimental evidence of the performance of the proposed
approach on both artificial data and a speaker verification task is provided.
