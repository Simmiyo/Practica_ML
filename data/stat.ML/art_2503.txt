PAWL-Forced Simulated Tempering
In this short note, we show how the parallel adaptive Wang-Landau (PAWL)
algorithm of Bornn et al. (2013) can be used to automate and improve simulated
tempering algorithms. While Wang-Landau and other stochastic approximation
methods have frequently been applied within the simulated tempering framework,
this note demonstrates through a simple example the additional improvements
brought about by parallelization, adaptive proposals and automated bin
splitting.
