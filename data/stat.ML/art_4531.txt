Diffusion Maximum Correntropy Criterion Algorithms for Robust
  Distributed Estimation
Robust diffusion adaptive estimation algorithms based on the maximum
correntropy criterion (MCC), including adaptation to combination MCC and
combination to adaptation MCC, are developed to deal with the distributed
estimation over network in impulsive (long-tailed) noise environments. The cost
functions used in distributed estimation are in general based on the mean
square error (MSE) criterion, which is desirable when the measurement noise is
Gaussian. In non-Gaussian situations, such as the impulsive-noise case, MCC
based methods may achieve much better performance than the MSE methods as they
take into account higher order statistics of error distribution. The proposed
methods can also outperform the robust diffusion least mean p-power(DLMP) and
diffusion minimum error entropy (DMEE) algorithms. The mean and mean square
convergence analysis of the new algorithms are also carried out.
