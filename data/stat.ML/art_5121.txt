Towards Wide Learning: Experiments in Healthcare
In this paper, a Wide Learning architecture is proposed that attempts to
automate the feature engineering portion of the machine learning (ML) pipeline.
Feature engineering is widely considered as the most time consuming and expert
knowledge demanding portion of any ML task. The proposed feature recommendation
approach is tested on 3 healthcare datasets: a) PhysioNet Challenge 2016
dataset of phonocardiogram (PCG) signals, b) MIMIC II blood pressure
classification dataset of photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals and c) an emotion
classification dataset of PPG signals. While the proposed method beats the
state of the art techniques for 2nd and 3rd dataset, it reaches 94.38% of the
accuracy level of the winner of PhysioNet Challenge 2016. In all cases, the
effort to reach a satisfactory performance was drastically less (a few days)
than manual feature engineering.
