Dynamic Screening: Accelerating First-Order Algorithms for the Lasso and
  Group-Lasso
Recent computational strategies based on screening tests have been proposed
to accelerate algorithms addressing penalized sparse regression problems such
as the Lasso. Such approaches build upon the idea that it is worth dedicating
some small computational effort to locate inactive atoms and remove them from
the dictionary in a preprocessing stage so that the regression algorithm
working with a smaller dictionary will then converge faster to the solution of
the initial problem. We believe that there is an even more efficient way to
screen the dictionary and obtain a greater acceleration: inside each iteration
of the regression algorithm, one may take advantage of the algorithm
computations to obtain a new screening test for free with increasing screening
effects along the iterations. The dictionary is henceforth dynamically screened
instead of being screened statically, once and for all, before the first
iteration. We formalize this dynamic screening principle in a general
algorithmic scheme and apply it by embedding inside a number of first-order
algorithms adapted existing screening tests to solve the Lasso or new screening
tests to solve the Group-Lasso. Computational gains are assessed in a large set
of experiments on synthetic data as well as real-world sounds and images. They
show both the screening efficiency and the gain in terms running times.
