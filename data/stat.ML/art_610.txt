A Scale Mixture Perspective of Multiplicative Noise in Neural Networks
Corrupting the input and hidden layers of deep neural networks (DNNs) with
multiplicative noise, often drawn from the Bernoulli distribution (or
'dropout'), provides regularization that has significantly contributed to deep
learning's success. However, understanding how multiplicative corruptions
prevent overfitting has been difficult due to the complexity of a DNN's
functional form. In this paper, we show that when a Gaussian prior is placed on
a DNN's weights, applying multiplicative noise induces a Gaussian scale
mixture, which can be reparameterized to circumvent the problematic likelihood
function. Analysis can then proceed by using a type-II maximum likelihood
procedure to derive a closed-form expression revealing how regularization
evolves as a function of the network's weights. Results show that
multiplicative noise forces weights to become either sparse or invariant to
rescaling. We find our analysis has implications for model compression as it
naturally reveals a weight pruning rule that starkly contrasts with the
commonly used signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While the SNR prunes weights with
large variances, seeing them as noisy, our approach recognizes their robustness
and retains them. We empirically demonstrate our approach has a strong
advantage over the SNR heuristic and is competitive to retraining with soft
targets produced from a teacher model.
