Similarity Function Tracking using Pairwise Comparisons
Recent work in distance metric learning has focused on learning
transformations of data that best align with specified pairwise similarity and
dissimilarity constraints, often supplied by a human observer. The learned
transformations lead to improved retrieval, classification, and clustering
algorithms due to the better adapted distance or similarity measures. Here, we
address the problem of learning these transformations when the underlying
constraint generation process is nonstationary. This nonstationarity can be due
to changes in either the ground-truth clustering used to generate constraints
or changes in the feature subspaces in which the class structure is apparent.
We propose Online Convex Ensemble StrongLy Adaptive Dynamic Learning (OCELAD),
a general adaptive, online approach for learning and tracking optimal metrics
as they change over time that is highly robust to a variety of nonstationary
behaviors in the changing metric. We apply the OCELAD framework to an ensemble
of online learners. Specifically, we create a retro-initialized composite
objective mirror descent (COMID) ensemble (RICE) consisting of a set of
parallel COMID learners with different learning rates, and demonstrate
parameter-free RICE-OCELAD metric learning on both synthetic data and a highly
nonstationary Twitter dataset. We show significant performance improvements and
increased robustness to nonstationary effects relative to previously proposed
batch and online distance metric learning algorithms.
