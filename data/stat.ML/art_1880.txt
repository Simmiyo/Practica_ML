Detecting low-complexity unobserved causes
We describe a method that infers whether statistical dependences between two
observed variables X and Y are due to a "direct" causal link or only due to a
connecting causal path that contains an unobserved variable of low complexity,
e.g., a binary variable. This problem is motivated by statistical genetics.
Given a genetic marker that is correlated with a phenotype of interest, we want
to detect whether this marker is causal or it only correlates with a causal
one. Our method is based on the analysis of the location of the conditional
distributions P(Y|x) in the simplex of all distributions of Y. We report
encouraging results on semi-empirical data.
