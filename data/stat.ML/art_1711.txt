Toward a Classification of Finite Partial-Monitoring Games
Partial-monitoring games constitute a mathematical framework for sequential
decision making problems with imperfect feedback: The learner repeatedly
chooses an action, opponent responds with an outcome, and then the learner
suffers a loss and receives a feedback signal, both of which are fixed
functions of the action and the outcome. The goal of the learner is to minimize
his total cumulative loss. We make progress towards the classification of these
games based on their minimax expected regret. Namely, we classify almost all
games with two outcomes and finite number of actions: We show that their
minimax expected regret is either zero, $\widetilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{T})$,
$\Theta(T^{2/3})$, or $\Theta(T)$ and we give a simple and efficiently
computable classification of these four classes of games. Our hope is that the
result can serve as a stepping stone toward classifying all finite
partial-monitoring games.
