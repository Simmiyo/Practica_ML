Evaluating gender portrayal in Bangladeshi TV
Computer Vision and machine learning methods were previously used to reveal
screen presence of genders in TV and movies. In this work, using head pose,
gender detection, and skin color estimation techniques, we demonstrate that the
gender disparity in TV in a South Asian country such as Bangladesh exhibits
unique characteristics and is sometimes counter-intuitive to popular
perception. We demonstrate a noticeable discrepancy in female screen presence
in Bangladeshi TV advertisements and political talk shows. Further, contrary to
popular hypotheses, we demonstrate that lighter-toned skin colors are less
prevalent than darker complexions, and additionally, quantifiable body language
markers do not provide conclusive insights about gender dynamics. Overall,
these gender portrayal parameters reveal the different layers of onscreen
gender politics and can help direct incentives to address existing disparities
in a nuanced and targeted manner.
