Generalized Inverse Classification
Inverse classification is the process of perturbing an instance in a
meaningful way such that it is more likely to conform to a specific class.
Historical methods that address such a problem are often framed to leverage
only a single classifier, or specific set of classifiers. These works are often
accompanied by naive assumptions. In this work we propose generalized inverse
classification (GIC), which avoids restricting the classification model that
can be used. We incorporate this formulation into a refined framework in which
GIC takes place. Under this framework, GIC operates on features that are
immediately actionable. Each change incurs an individual cost, either linear or
non-linear. Such changes are subjected to occur within a specified level of
cumulative change (budget). Furthermore, our framework incorporates the
estimation of features that change as a consequence of direct actions taken
(indirectly changeable features). To solve such a problem, we propose three
real-valued heuristic-based methods and two sensitivity analysis-based
comparison methods, each of which is evaluated on two freely available
real-world datasets. Our results demonstrate the validity and benefits of our
formulation, framework, and methods.
