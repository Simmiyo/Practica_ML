Bayesian Information Sharing Between Noise And Regression Models
  Improves Prediction of Weak Effects
We consider the prediction of weak effects in a multiple-output regression
setup, when covariates are expected to explain a small amount, less than
$\approx 1%$, of the variance of the target variables. To facilitate the
prediction of the weak effects, we constrain our model structure by introducing
a novel Bayesian approach of sharing information between the regression model
and the noise model. Further reduction of the effective number of parameters is
achieved by introducing an infinite shrinkage prior and group sparsity in the
context of the Bayesian reduced rank regression, and using the Bayesian
infinite factor model as a flexible low-rank noise model. In our experiments
the model incorporating the novelties outperformed alternatives in genomic
prediction of rich phenotype data. In particular, the information sharing
between the noise and regression models led to significant improvement in
prediction accuracy.
