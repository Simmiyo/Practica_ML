Representation Learning for Clustering: A Statistical Framework
We address the problem of communicating domain knowledge from a user to the
designer of a clustering algorithm. We propose a protocol in which the user
provides a clustering of a relatively small random sample of a data set. The
algorithm designer then uses that sample to come up with a data representation
under which $k$-means clustering results in a clustering (of the full data set)
that is aligned with the user's clustering. We provide a formal statistical
model for analyzing the sample complexity of learning a clustering
representation with this paradigm. We then introduce a notion of capacity of a
class of possible representations, in the spirit of the VC-dimension, showing
that classes of representations that have finite such dimension can be
successfully learned with sample size error bounds, and end our discussion with
an analysis of that dimension for classes of representations induced by linear
embeddings.
