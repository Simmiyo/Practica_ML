Adaptive Evolutionary Clustering
In many practical applications of clustering, the objects to be clustered
evolve over time, and a clustering result is desired at each time step. In such
applications, evolutionary clustering typically outperforms traditional static
clustering by producing clustering results that reflect long-term trends while
being robust to short-term variations. Several evolutionary clustering
algorithms have recently been proposed, often by adding a temporal smoothness
penalty to the cost function of a static clustering method. In this paper, we
introduce a different approach to evolutionary clustering by accurately
tracking the time-varying proximities between objects followed by static
clustering. We present an evolutionary clustering framework that adaptively
estimates the optimal smoothing parameter using shrinkage estimation, a
statistical approach that improves a naive estimate using additional
information. The proposed framework can be used to extend a variety of static
clustering algorithms, including hierarchical, k-means, and spectral
clustering, into evolutionary clustering algorithms. Experiments on synthetic
and real data sets indicate that the proposed framework outperforms static
clustering and existing evolutionary clustering algorithms in many scenarios.
