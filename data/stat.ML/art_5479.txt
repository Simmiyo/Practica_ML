Configurable 3D Scene Synthesis and 2D Image Rendering with Per-Pixel
  Ground Truth using Stochastic Grammars
We propose a systematic learning-based approach to the generation of massive
quantities of synthetic 3D scenes and arbitrary numbers of photorealistic 2D
images thereof, with associated ground truth information, for the purposes of
training, benchmarking, and diagnosing learning-based computer vision and
robotics algorithms. In particular, we devise a learning-based pipeline of
algorithms capable of automatically generating and rendering a potentially
infinite variety of indoor scenes by using a stochastic grammar, represented as
an attributed Spatial And-Or Graph, in conjunction with state-of-the-art
physics-based rendering. Our pipeline is capable of synthesizing scene layouts
with high diversity, and it is configurable inasmuch as it enables the precise
customization and control of important attributes of the generated scenes. It
renders photorealistic RGB images of the generated scenes while automatically
synthesizing detailed, per-pixel ground truth data, including visible surface
depth and normal, object identity, and material information (detailed to object
parts), as well as environments (e.g., illuminations and camera viewpoints). We
demonstrate the value of our synthesized dataset, by improving performance in
certain machine-learning-based scene understanding tasks--depth and surface
normal prediction, semantic segmentation, reconstruction, etc.--and by
providing benchmarks for and diagnostics of trained models by modifying object
attributes and scene properties in a controllable manner.
