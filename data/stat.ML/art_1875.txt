Sequential Inference for Latent Force Models
Latent force models (LFMs) are hybrid models combining mechanistic principles
with non-parametric components. In this article, we shall show how LFMs can be
equivalently formulated and solved using the state variable approach. We shall
also show how the Gaussian process prior used in LFMs can be equivalently
formulated as a linear statespace model driven by a white noise process and how
inference on the resulting model can be efficiently implemented using Kalman
filter and smoother. Then we shall show how the recently proposed switching LFM
can be reformulated using the state variable approach, and how we can construct
a probabilistic model for the switches by formulating a similar switching LFM
as a switching linear dynamic system (SLDS). We illustrate the performance of
the proposed methodology in simulated scenarios and apply it to inferring the
switching points in GPS data collected from car movement data in urban
environment.
