Asymptotic Confidence Sets for General Nonparametric Regression and
  Classification by Regularized Kernel Methods
Regularized kernel methods such as, e.g., support vector machines and
least-squares support vector regression constitute an important class of
standard learning algorithms in machine learning. Theoretical investigations
concerning asymptotic properties have manly focused on rates of convergence
during the last years but there are only very few and limited (asymptotic)
results on statistical inference so far. As this is a serious limitation for
their use in mathematical statistics, the goal of the article is to fill this
gap. Based on asymptotic normality of many of these methods, the article
derives a strongly consistent estimator for the unknown covariance matrix of
the limiting normal distribution. In this way, we obtain asymptotically correct
confidence sets for $\psi(f_{P,\lambda_0})$ where $f_{P,\lambda_0}$ denotes the
minimizer of the regularized risk in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space $H$
and $\psi:H\rightarrow\mathds{R}^m$ is any Hadamard-differentiable functional.
Applications include (multivariate) pointwise confidence sets for values of
$f_{P,\lambda_0}$ and confidence sets for gradients, integrals, and norms.
