Convergent Message-Passing Algorithms for Inference over General Graphs
  with Convex Free Energies
Inference problems in graphical models can be represented as a constrained
optimization of a free energy function. It is known that when the Bethe free
energy is used, the fixedpoints of the belief propagation (BP) algorithm
correspond to the local minima of the free energy. However BP fails to converge
in many cases of interest. Moreover, the Bethe free energy is non-convex for
graphical models with cycles thus introducing great difficulty in deriving
efficient algorithms for finding local minima of the free energy for general
graphs. In this paper we introduce two efficient BP-like algorithms, one
sequential and the other parallel, that are guaranteed to converge to the
global minimum, for any graph, over the class of energies known as "convex free
energies". In addition, we propose an efficient heuristic for setting the
parameters of the convex free energy based on the structure of the graph.
