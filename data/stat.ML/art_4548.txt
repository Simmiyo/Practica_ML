AUC Optimisation and Collaborative Filtering
In recommendation systems, one is interested in the ranking of the predicted
items as opposed to other losses such as the mean squared error. Although a
variety of ways to evaluate rankings exist in the literature, here we focus on
the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) as it widely used and has a strong
theoretical underpinning. In practical recommendation, only items at the top of
the ranked list are presented to the users. With this in mind, we propose a
class of objective functions over matrix factorisations which primarily
represent a smooth surrogate for the real AUC, and in a special case we show
how to prioritise the top of the list. The objectives are differentiable and
optimised through a carefully designed stochastic gradient-descent-based
algorithm which scales linearly with the size of the data. In the special case
of square loss we show how to improve computational complexity by leveraging
previously computed measures. To understand theoretically the underlying matrix
factorisation approaches we study both the consistency of the loss functions
with respect to AUC, and generalisation using Rademacher theory. The resulting
generalisation analysis gives strong motivation for the optimisation under
study. Finally, we provide computation results as to the efficacy of the
proposed method using synthetic and real data.
