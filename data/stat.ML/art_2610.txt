Boosting in the presence of label noise
Boosting is known to be sensitive to label noise. We studied two approaches
to improve AdaBoost's robustness against labelling errors. One is to employ a
label-noise robust classifier as a base learner, while the other is to modify
the AdaBoost algorithm to be more robust. Empirical evaluation shows that a
committee of robust classifiers, although converges faster than non label-noise
aware AdaBoost, is still susceptible to label noise. However, pairing it with
the new robust Boosting algorithm we propose here results in a more resilient
algorithm under mislabelling.
