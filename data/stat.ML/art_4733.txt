Short Communication on QUIST: A Quick Clustering Algorithm
In this short communication we introduce the quick clustering algorithm
(QUIST), an efficient hierarchical clustering algorithm based on sorting. QUIST
is a poly-logarithmic divisive clustering algorithm that does not assume the
number of clusters, and/or the cluster size to be known ahead of time. It is
also insensitive to the original ordering of the input.
