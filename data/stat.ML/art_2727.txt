Structure-Aware Dynamic Scheduler for Parallel Machine Learning
Training large machine learning (ML) models with many variables or parameters
can take a long time if one employs sequential procedures even with stochastic
updates. A natural solution is to turn to distributed computing on a cluster;
however, naive, unstructured parallelization of ML algorithms does not usually
lead to a proportional speedup and can even result in divergence, because
dependencies between model elements can attenuate the computational gains from
parallelization and compromise correctness of inference. Recent efforts toward
this issue have benefited from exploiting the static, a priori block structures
residing in ML algorithms. In this paper, we take this path further by
exploring the dynamic block structures and workloads therein present during ML
program execution, which offers new opportunities for improving convergence,
correctness, and load balancing in distributed ML. We propose and showcase a
general-purpose scheduler, STRADS, for coordinating distributed updates in ML
algorithms, which harnesses the aforementioned opportunities in a systematic
way. We provide theoretical guarantees for our scheduler, and demonstrate its
efficacy versus static block structures on Lasso and Matrix Factorization.
