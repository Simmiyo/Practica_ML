The Gaussian Radon Transform and Machine Learning
There has been growing recent interest in probabilistic interpretations of
kernel-based methods as well as learning in Banach spaces. The absence of a
useful Lebesgue measure on an infinite-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert
space is a serious obstacle for such stochastic models. We propose an
estimation model for the ridge regression problem within the framework of
abstract Wiener spaces and show how the support vector machine solution to such
problems can be interpreted in terms of the Gaussian Radon transform.
