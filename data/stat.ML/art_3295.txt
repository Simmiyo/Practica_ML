The Approximation of the Dissimilarity Projection
Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data allow to reconstruct the 3D
pathways of axons within the white matter of the brain as a tractography. The
analysis of tractographies has drawn attention from the machine learning and
pattern recognition communities providing novel challenges such as finding an
appropriate representation space for the data. Many of the current learning
algorithms require the input to be from a vectorial space. This requirement
contrasts with the intrinsic nature of the tractography because its basic
elements, called streamlines or tracks, have different lengths and different
number of points and for this reason they cannot be directly represented in a
common vectorial space. In this work we propose the adoption of the
dissimilarity representation which is an Euclidean embedding technique defined
by selecting a set of streamlines called prototypes and then mapping any new
streamline to the vector of distances from prototypes. We investigate the
degree of approximation of this projection under different prototype selection
policies and prototype set sizes in order to characterise its use on
tractography data. Additionally we propose the use of a scalable approximation
of the most effective prototype selection policy that provides fast and
accurate dissimilarity approximations of complete tractographies.
