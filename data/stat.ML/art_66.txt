Sparsification and feature selection by compressive linear regression
The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle states that the optimal model
for a given data set is that which compresses it best. Due to practial
limitations the model can be restricted to a class such as linear regression
models, which we address in this study. As in other formulations such as the
LASSO and forward step-wise regression we are interested in sparsifying the
feature set while preserving generalization ability. We derive a
well-principled set of codes for both parameters and error residuals along with
smooth approximations to lengths of these codes as to allow gradient descent
optimization of description length, and go on to show that sparsification and
feature selection using our approach is faster than the LASSO on several
datasets from the UCI and StatLib repositories, with favorable generalization
accuracy, while being fully automatic, requiring neither cross-validation nor
tuning of regularization hyper-parameters, allowing even for a nonlinear
expansion of the feature set followed by sparsification.
