An Overview of Melanoma Detection in Dermoscopy Images Using Image
  Processing and Machine Learning
The incidence of malignant melanoma continues to increase worldwide. This
cancer can strike at any age; it is one of the leading causes of loss of life
in young persons. Since this cancer is visible on the skin, it is potentially
detectable at a very early stage when it is curable. New developments have
converged to make fully automatic early melanoma detection a real possibility.
First, the advent of dermoscopy has enabled a dramatic boost in clinical
diagnostic ability to the point that melanoma can be detected in the clinic at
the very earliest stages. The global adoption of this technology has allowed
accumulation of large collections of dermoscopy images of melanomas and benign
lesions validated by histopathology. The development of advanced technologies
in the areas of image processing and machine learning have given us the ability
to allow distinction of malignant melanoma from the many benign mimics that
require no biopsy. These new technologies should allow not only earlier
detection of melanoma, but also reduction of the large number of needless and
costly biopsy procedures. Although some of the new systems reported for these
technologies have shown promise in preliminary trials, widespread
implementation must await further technical progress in accuracy and
reproducibility. In this paper, we provide an overview of computerized
detection of melanoma in dermoscopy images. First, we discuss the various
aspects of lesion segmentation. Then, we provide a brief overview of clinical
feature segmentation. Finally, we discuss the classification stage where
machine learning algorithms are applied to the attributes generated from the
segmented features to predict the existence of melanoma.
