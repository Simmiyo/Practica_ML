Automatic Relevance Determination For Deep Generative Models
A recurring problem when building probabilistic latent variable models is
regularization and model selection, for instance, the choice of the
dimensionality of the latent space. In the context of belief networks with
latent variables, this problem has been adressed with Automatic Relevance
Determination (ARD) employing Monte Carlo inference. We present a variational
inference approach to ARD for Deep Generative Models using doubly stochastic
variational inference to provide fast and scalable learning. We show empirical
results on a standard dataset illustrating the effects of contracting the
latent space automatically. We show that the resulting latent representations
are significantly more compact without loss of expressive power of the learned
models.
