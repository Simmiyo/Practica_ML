Large-scale Kernel-based Feature Extraction via Budgeted Nonlinear
  Subspace Tracking
Kernel-based methods enjoy powerful generalization capabilities in handling a
variety of learning tasks. When such methods are provided with sufficient
training data, broadly-applicable classes of nonlinear functions can be
approximated with desired accuracy. Nevertheless, inherent to the nonparametric
nature of kernel-based estimators are computational and memory requirements
that become prohibitive with large-scale datasets. In response to this
formidable challenge, the present work puts forward a low-rank, kernel-based,
feature extraction approach that is particularly tailored for online operation,
where data streams need not be stored in memory. A novel generative model is
introduced to approximate high-dimensional (possibly infinite) features via a
low-rank nonlinear subspace, the learning of which leads to a direct kernel
function approximation. Offline and online solvers are developed for the
subspace learning task, along with affordable versions, in which the number of
stored data vectors is confined to a predefined budget. Analytical results
provide performance bounds on how well the kernel matrix as well as
kernel-based classification and regression tasks can be approximated by
leveraging budgeted online subspace learning and feature extraction schemes.
Tests on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate and benchmark the efficiency
of the proposed method when linear classification and regression is applied to
the extracted features.
