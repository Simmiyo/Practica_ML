A model selection approach for clustering a multinomial sequence with
  non-negative factorization
We consider a problem of clustering a sequence of multinomial observations by
way of a model selection criterion. We propose a form of a penalty term for the
model selection procedure. Our approach subsumes both the conventional AIC and
BIC criteria but also extends the conventional criteria in a way that it can be
applicable also to a sequence of sparse multinomial observations, where even
within a same cluster, the number of multinomial trials may be different for
different observations. In addition, as a preliminary estimation step to
maximum likelihood estimation, and more generally, to maximum $L_{q}$
estimation, we propose to use reduced rank projection in combination with
non-negative factorization. We motivate our approach by showing that our model
selection criterion and preliminary estimation step yield consistent estimates
under simplifying assumptions. We also illustrate our approach through
numerical experiments using real and simulated data.
