A New Class of Upper Bounds on the Log Partition Function
Bounds on the log partition function are important in a variety of contexts,
including approximate inference, model fitting, decision theory, and large
deviations analysis. We introduce a new class of upper bounds on the log
partition function, based on convex combinations of distributions in the
exponential domain, that is applicable to an arbitrary undirected graphical
model. In the special case of convex combinations of tree-structured
distributions, we obtain a family of variational problems, similar to the Bethe
free energy, but distinguished by the following desirable properties: i. they
are cnvex, and have a unique global minimum; and ii. the global minimum gives
an upper bound on the log partition function. The global minimum is defined by
stationary conditions very similar to those defining fixed points of belief
propagation or tree-based reparameterization Wainwright et al., 2001. As with
BP fixed points, the elements of the minimizing argument can be used as
approximations to the marginals of the original model. The analysis described
here can be extended to structures of higher treewidth e.g., hypertrees,
thereby making connections with more advanced approximations e.g., Kikuchi and
variants Yedidia et al., 2001; Minka, 2001.
