AUC-maximized Deep Convolutional Neural Fields for Sequence Labeling
Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) has shown excellent performance in
a variety of machine learning tasks. This manuscript presents Deep
Convolutional Neural Fields (DeepCNF), a combination of DCNN with Conditional
Random Field (CRF), for sequence labeling with highly imbalanced label
distribution. The widely-used training methods, such as maximum-likelihood and
maximum labelwise accuracy, do not work well on highly imbalanced data. To
handle this, we present a new training algorithm called maximum-AUC for
DeepCNF. That is, we train DeepCNF by directly maximizing the empirical Area
Under the ROC Curve (AUC), which is an unbiased measurement for imbalanced
data. To fulfill this, we formulate AUC in a pairwise ranking framework,
approximate it by a polynomial function and then apply a gradient-based
procedure to optimize it. We then test our AUC-maximized DeepCNF on three very
different protein sequence labeling tasks: solvent accessibility prediction,
8-state secondary structure prediction, and disorder prediction. Our
experimental results confirm that maximum-AUC greatly outperforms the other two
training methods on 8-state secondary structure prediction and disorder
prediction since their label distributions are highly imbalanced and also have
similar performance as the other two training methods on the solvent
accessibility prediction problem which has three equally-distributed labels.
Furthermore, our experimental results also show that our AUC-trained DeepCNF
models greatly outperform existing popular predictors of these three tasks.
