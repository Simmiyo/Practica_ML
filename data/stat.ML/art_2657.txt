Regularization in Relevance Learning Vector Quantization Using l one
  Norms
We propose in this contribution a method for l one regularization in
prototype based relevance learning vector quantization (LVQ) for sparse
relevance profiles. Sparse relevance profiles in hyperspectral data analysis
fade down those spectral bands which are not necessary for classification. In
particular, we consider the sparsity in the relevance profile enforced by LASSO
optimization. The latter one is obtained by a gradient learning scheme using a
differentiable parametrized approximation of the $l_{1}$-norm, which has an
upper error bound. We extend this regularization idea also to the matrix
learning variant of LVQ as the natural generalization of relevance learning.
