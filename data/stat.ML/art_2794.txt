The Random Forest Kernel and other kernels for big data from random
  partitions
We present Random Partition Kernels, a new class of kernels derived by
demonstrating a natural connection between random partitions of objects and
kernels between those objects. We show how the construction can be used to
create kernels from methods that would not normally be viewed as random
partitions, such as Random Forest. To demonstrate the potential of this method,
we propose two new kernels, the Random Forest Kernel and the Fast Cluster
Kernel, and show that these kernels consistently outperform standard kernels on
problems involving real-world datasets. Finally, we show how the form of these
kernels lend themselves to a natural approximation that is appropriate for
certain big data problems, allowing $O(N)$ inference in methods such as
Gaussian Processes, Support Vector Machines and Kernel PCA.
