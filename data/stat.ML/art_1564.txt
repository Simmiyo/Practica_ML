Empirical bounds for functions with weak interactions
We provide sharp empirical estimates of expectation, variance and normal
approximation for a class of statistics whose variation in any argument does
not change too much when another argument is modified. Examples of such weak
interactions are furnished by U- and V-statistics, Lipschitz L-statistics and
various error functionals of L2-regularized algorithms and Gibbs algorithms.
