Visualization of Manifold-Valued Elements by Multidimensional Scaling
The present contribution suggests the use of a multidimensional scaling (MDS)
algorithm as a visualization tool for manifold-valued elements. A visualization
tool of this kind is useful in signal processing and machine learning whenever
learning/adaptation algorithms insist on high-dimensional parameter manifolds.
