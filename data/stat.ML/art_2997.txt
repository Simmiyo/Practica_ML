Learning Machines Implemented on Non-Deterministic Hardware
This paper highlights new opportunities for designing large-scale machine
learning systems as a consequence of blurring traditional boundaries that have
allowed algorithm designers and application-level practitioners to stay -- for
the most part -- oblivious to the details of the underlying hardware-level
implementations. The hardware/software co-design methodology advocated here
hinges on the deployment of compute-intensive machine learning kernels onto
compute platforms that trade-off determinism in the computation for improvement
in speed and/or energy efficiency. To achieve this, we revisit digital
stochastic circuits for approximating matrix computations that are ubiquitous
in machine learning algorithms. Theoretical and empirical evaluation is
undertaken to assess the impact of the hardware-induced computational noise on
algorithm performance. As a proof-of-concept, a stochastic hardware simulator
is employed for training deep neural networks for image recognition problems.
