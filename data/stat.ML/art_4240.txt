Recovery of Missing Samples Using Sparse Approximation via a Convex
  Similarity Measure
In this paper, we study the missing sample recovery problem using methods
based on sparse approximation. In this regard, we investigate the algorithms
used for solving the inverse problem associated with the restoration of missed
samples of image signal. This problem is also known as inpainting in the
context of image processing and for this purpose, we suggest an iterative
sparse recovery algorithm based on constrained $l_1$-norm minimization with a
new fidelity metric. The proposed metric called Convex SIMilarity (CSIM) index,
is a simplified version of the Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index, which is
convex and error-sensitive. The optimization problem incorporating this
criterion, is then solved via Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
(ADMM). Simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed method for
missing sample recovery of 1D patch vectors and inpainting of 2D image signals.
