Multi-task Feature Selection based Anomaly Detection
Network anomaly detection is still a vibrant research area. As the fast
growth of network bandwidth and the tremendous traffic on the network, there
arises an extremely challengeable question: How to efficiently and accurately
detect the anomaly on multiple traffic? In multi-task learning, the traffic
consisting of flows at different time periods is considered as a task. Multiple
tasks at different time periods performed simultaneously to detect anomalies.
In this paper, we apply the multi-task feature selection in network anomaly
detection area which provides a powerful method to gather information from
multiple traffic and detect anomalies on it simultaneously. In particular, the
multi-task feature selection includes the well-known l1-norm based feature
selection as a special case given only one task. Moreover, we show that the
multi-task feature selection is more accurate by utilizing more information
simultaneously than the l1-norm based method. At the evaluation stage, we
preprocess the raw data trace from trans-Pacific backbone link between Japan
and the United States, label with anomaly communities, and generate a
248-feature dataset. We show empirically that the multi-task feature selection
outperforms independent l1-norm based feature selection on real traffic
dataset.
