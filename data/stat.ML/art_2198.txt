The Fast Cauchy Transform and Faster Robust Linear Regression
We provide fast algorithms for overconstrained $\ell_p$ regression and
related problems: for an $n\times d$ input matrix $A$ and vector
$b\in\mathbb{R}^n$, in $O(nd\log n)$ time we reduce the problem
$\min_{x\in\mathbb{R}^d} \|Ax-b\|_p$ to the same problem with input matrix
$\tilde A$ of dimension $s \times d$ and corresponding $\tilde b$ of dimension
$s\times 1$. Here, $\tilde A$ and $\tilde b$ are a coreset for the problem,
consisting of sampled and rescaled rows of $A$ and $b$; and $s$ is independent
of $n$ and polynomial in $d$. Our results improve on the best previous
algorithms when $n\gg d$, for all $p\in[1,\infty)$ except $p=2$. We also
provide a suite of improved results for finding well-conditioned bases via
ellipsoidal rounding, illustrating tradeoffs between running time and
conditioning quality, including a one-pass conditioning algorithm for general
$\ell_p$ problems.
  We also provide an empirical evaluation of implementations of our algorithms
for $p=1$, comparing them with related algorithms. Our empirical results show
that, in the asymptotic regime, the theory is a very good guide to the
practical performance of these algorithms. Our algorithms use our faster
constructions of well-conditioned bases for $\ell_p$ spaces and, for $p=1$, a
fast subspace embedding of independent interest that we call the Fast Cauchy
Transform: a distribution over matrices $\Pi:\mathbb{R}^n\mapsto
\mathbb{R}^{O(d\log d)}$, found obliviously to $A$, that approximately
preserves the $\ell_1$ norms: that is, with large probability, simultaneously
for all $x$, $\|Ax\|_1 \approx \|\Pi Ax\|_1$, with distortion $O(d^{2+\eta})$,
for an arbitrarily small constant $\eta>0$; and, moreover, $\Pi A$ can be
computed in $O(nd\log d)$ time. The techniques underlying our Fast Cauchy
Transform include fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss transforms, low-coherence
matrices, and rescaling by Cauchy random variables.
