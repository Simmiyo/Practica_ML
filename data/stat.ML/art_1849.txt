A Split-Merge MCMC Algorithm for the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process
The hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) has become an important Bayesian
nonparametric model for grouped data, such as document collections. The HDP is
used to construct a flexible mixed-membership model where the number of
components is determined by the data. As for most Bayesian nonparametric
models, exact posterior inference is intractable---practitioners use Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or variational inference. Inspired by the split-merge
MCMC algorithm for the Dirichlet process (DP) mixture model, we describe a
novel split-merge MCMC sampling algorithm for posterior inference in the HDP.
We study its properties on both synthetic data and text corpora. We find that
split-merge MCMC for the HDP can provide significant improvements over
traditional Gibbs sampling, and we give some understanding of the data
properties that give rise to larger improvements.
