Stabilized Sparse Online Learning for Sparse Data
Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is commonly used for optimization in
large-scale machine learning problems. Langford et al. (2009) introduce a
sparse online learning method to induce sparsity via truncated gradient. With
high-dimensional sparse data, however, the method suffers from slow convergence
and high variance due to the heterogeneity in feature sparsity. To mitigate
this issue, we introduce a stabilized truncated stochastic gradient descent
algorithm. We employ a soft-thresholding scheme on the weight vector where the
imposed shrinkage is adaptive to the amount of information available in each
feature. The variability in the resulted sparse weight vector is further
controlled by stability selection integrated with the informative truncation.
To facilitate better convergence, we adopt an annealing strategy on the
truncation rate, which leads to a balanced trade-off between exploration and
exploitation in learning a sparse weight vector. Numerical experiments show
that our algorithm compares favorably with the original algorithm in terms of
prediction accuracy, achieved sparsity and stability.
