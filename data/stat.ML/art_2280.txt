Active Learning with Distributional Estimates
Active Learning (AL) is increasingly important in a broad range of
applications. Two main AL principles to obtain accurate classification with few
labeled data are refinement of the current decision boundary and exploration of
poorly sampled regions. In this paper we derive a novel AL scheme that balances
these two principles in a natural way. In contrast to many AL strategies, which
are based on an estimated class conditional probability ^p(y|x), a key
component of our approach is to view this quantity as a random variable, hence
explicitly considering the uncertainty in its estimated value. Our main
contribution is a novel mathematical framework for uncertainty-based AL, and a
corresponding AL scheme, where the uncertainty in ^p(y|x) is modeled by a
second-order distribution. On the practical side, we show how to approximate
such second-order distributions for kernel density classification. Finally, we
find that over a large number of UCI, USPS and Caltech4 datasets, our AL scheme
achieves significantly better learning curves than popular AL methods such as
uncertainty sampling and error reduction sampling, when all use the same kernel
density classifier.
