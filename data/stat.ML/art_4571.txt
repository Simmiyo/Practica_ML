A Sufficient Statistics Construction of Bayesian Nonparametric
  Exponential Family Conjugate Models
Conjugate pairs of distributions over infinite dimensional spaces are
prominent in statistical learning theory, particularly due to the widespread
adoption of Bayesian nonparametric methodologies for a host of models and
applications. Much of the existing literature in the learning community focuses
on processes possessing some form of computationally tractable conjugacy as is
the case for the beta and gamma processes (and, via normalization, the
Dirichlet process). For these processes, proofs of conjugacy and requisite
derivation of explicit computational formulae for posterior density parameters
are idiosyncratic to the stochastic process in question. As such, Bayesian
Nonparametric models are currently available for a limited number of conjugate
pairs, e.g. the Dirichlet-multinomial and beta-Bernoulli process pairs. In each
of these above cases the likelihood process belongs to the class of discrete
exponential family distributions. The exclusion of continuous likelihood
distributions from the known cases of Bayesian Nonparametric Conjugate models
stands as a disparity in the researcher's toolbox.
  In this paper we first address the problem of obtaining a general
construction of prior distributions over infinite dimensional spaces possessing
distributional properties amenable to conjugacy. Second, we bridge the divide
between the discrete and continuous likelihoods by illustrating a canonical
construction for stochastic processes whose Levy measure densities are from
positive exponential families, and then demonstrate that these processes in
fact form the prior, likelihood, and posterior in a conjugate family. Our
canonical construction subsumes known computational formulae for posterior
density parameters in the cases where the likelihood is from a discrete
distribution belonging to an exponential family.
