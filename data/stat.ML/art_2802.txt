Variational Particle Approximations
Approximate inference in high-dimensional, discrete probabilistic models is a
central problem in computational statistics and machine learning. This paper
describes discrete particle variational inference (DPVI), a new approach that
combines key strengths of Monte Carlo, variational and search-based techniques.
DPVI is based on a novel family of particle-based variational approximations
that can be fit using simple, fast, deterministic search techniques. Like Monte
Carlo, DPVI can handle multiple modes, and yields exact results in a
well-defined limit. Like unstructured mean-field, DPVI is based on optimizing a
lower bound on the partition function; when this quantity is not of intrinsic
interest, it facilitates convergence assessment and debugging. Like both Monte
Carlo and combinatorial search, DPVI can take advantage of factorization,
sequential structure, and custom search operators. This paper defines DPVI
particle-based approximation family and partition function lower bounds, along
with the sequential DPVI and local DPVI algorithm templates for optimizing
them. DPVI is illustrated and evaluated via experiments on lattice Markov
Random Fields, nonparametric Bayesian mixtures and block-models, and parametric
as well as non-parametric hidden Markov models. Results include applications to
real-world spike-sorting and relational modeling problems, and show that DPVI
can offer appealing time/accuracy trade-offs as compared to multiple
alternatives.
