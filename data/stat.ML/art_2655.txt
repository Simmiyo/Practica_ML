A Theoretical and Experimental Comparison of the EM and SEM Algorithm
In this paper we provide a new analysis of the SEM algorithm. Unlike previous
work, we focus on the analysis of a single run of the algorithm. First, we
discuss the algorithm for general mixture distributions. Second, we consider
Gaussian mixture models and show that with high probability the update
equations of the EM algorithm and its stochastic variant are almost the same,
given that the input set is sufficiently large. Our experiments confirm that
this still holds for a large number of successive update steps. In particular,
for Gaussian mixture models, we show that the stochastic variant runs nearly
twice as fast.
