Sparse Matrix Factorization
We investigate the problem of factorizing a matrix into several sparse
matrices and propose an algorithm for this under randomness and sparsity
assumptions. This problem can be viewed as a simplification of the deep
learning problem where finding a factorization corresponds to finding edges in
different layers and values of hidden units. We prove that under certain
assumptions for a sparse linear deep network with $n$ nodes in each layer, our
algorithm is able to recover the structure of the network and values of top
layer hidden units for depths up to $\tilde O(n^{1/6})$. We further discuss the
relation among sparse matrix factorization, deep learning, sparse recovery and
dictionary learning.
