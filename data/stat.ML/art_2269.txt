Exploiting compositionality to explore a large space of model structures
The recent proliferation of richly structured probabilistic models raises the
question of how to automatically determine an appropriate model for a dataset.
We investigate this question for a space of matrix decomposition models which
can express a variety of widely used models from unsupervised learning. To
enable model selection, we organize these models into a context-free grammar
which generates a wide variety of structures through the compositional
application of a few simple rules. We use our grammar to generically and
efficiently infer latent components and estimate predictive likelihood for
nearly 2500 structures using a small toolbox of reusable algorithms. Using a
greedy search over our grammar, we automatically choose the decomposition
structure from raw data by evaluating only a small fraction of all models. The
proposed method typically finds the correct structure for synthetic data and
backs off gracefully to simpler models under heavy noise. It learns sensible
structures for datasets as diverse as image patches, motion capture, 20
Questions, and U.S. Senate votes, all using exactly the same code.
