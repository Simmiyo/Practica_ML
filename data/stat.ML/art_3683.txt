Natural Language Understanding with Distributed Representation
This is a lecture note for the course DS-GA 3001 <Natural Language
Understanding with Distributed Representation> at the Center for Data Science ,
New York University in Fall, 2015. As the name of the course suggests, this
lecture note introduces readers to a neural network based approach to natural
language understanding/processing. In order to make it as self-contained as
possible, I spend much time on describing basics of machine learning and neural
networks, only after which how they are used for natural languages is
introduced. On the language front, I almost solely focus on language modelling
and machine translation, two of which I personally find most fascinating and
most fundamental to natural language understanding.
