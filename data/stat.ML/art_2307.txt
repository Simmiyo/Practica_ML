On the Convergence of Bound Optimization Algorithms
Many practitioners who use the EM algorithm complain that it is sometimes
slow. When does this happen, and what can be done about it? In this paper, we
study the general class of bound optimization algorithms - including
Expectation-Maximization, Iterative Scaling and CCCP - and their relationship
to direct optimization algorithms such as gradient-based methods for parameter
learning. We derive a general relationship between the updates performed by
bound optimization methods and those of gradient and second-order methods and
identify analytic conditions under which bound optimization algorithms exhibit
quasi-Newton behavior, and conditions under which they possess poor,
first-order convergence. Based on this analysis, we consider several specific
algorithms, interpret and analyze their convergence properties and provide some
recipes for preprocessing input to these algorithms to yield faster convergence
behavior. We report empirical results supporting our analysis and showing that
simple data preprocessing can result in dramatically improved performance of
bound optimizers in practice.
