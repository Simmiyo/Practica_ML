Learning Optimal Interventions
Our goal is to identify beneficial interventions from observational data. We
consider interventions that are narrowly focused (impacting few covariates) and
may be tailored to each individual or globally enacted over a population. For
applications where harmful intervention is drastically worse than proposing no
change, we propose a conservative definition of the optimal intervention.
Assuming the underlying relationship remains invariant under intervention, we
develop efficient algorithms to identify the optimal intervention policy from
limited data and provide theoretical guarantees for our approach in a Gaussian
Process setting. Although our methods assume covariates can be precisely
adjusted, they remain capable of improving outcomes in misspecified settings
where interventions incur unintentional downstream effects. Empirically, our
approach identifies good interventions in two practical applications: gene
perturbation and writing improvement.
