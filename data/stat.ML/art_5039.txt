On the (im)possibility of fairness
What does it mean for an algorithm to be fair? Different papers use different
notions of algorithmic fairness, and although these appear internally
consistent, they also seem mutually incompatible. We present a mathematical
setting in which the distinctions in previous papers can be made formal. In
addition to characterizing the spaces of inputs (the "observed" space) and
outputs (the "decision" space), we introduce the notion of a construct space: a
space that captures unobservable, but meaningful variables for the prediction.
  We show that in order to prove desirable properties of the entire
decision-making process, different mechanisms for fairness require different
assumptions about the nature of the mapping from construct space to decision
space. The results in this paper imply that future treatments of algorithmic
fairness should more explicitly state assumptions about the relationship
between constructs and observations.
