Scalable Matrix-valued Kernel Learning for High-dimensional Nonlinear
  Multivariate Regression and Granger Causality
We propose a general matrix-valued multiple kernel learning framework for
high-dimensional nonlinear multivariate regression problems. This framework
allows a broad class of mixed norm regularizers, including those that induce
sparsity, to be imposed on a dictionary of vector-valued Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Spaces. We develop a highly scalable and eigendecomposition-free
algorithm that orchestrates two inexact solvers for simultaneously learning
both the input and output components of separable matrix-valued kernels. As a
key application enabled by our framework, we show how high-dimensional causal
inference tasks can be naturally cast as sparse function estimation problems,
leading to novel nonlinear extensions of a class of Graphical Granger Causality
techniques. Our algorithmic developments and extensive empirical studies are
complemented by theoretical analyses in terms of Rademacher generalization
bounds.
