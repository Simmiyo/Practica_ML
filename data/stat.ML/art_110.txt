Exact block-wise optimization in group lasso and sparse group lasso for
  linear regression
The group lasso is a penalized regression method, used in regression problems
where the covariates are partitioned into groups to promote sparsity at the
group level. Existing methods for finding the group lasso estimator either use
gradient projection methods to update the entire coefficient vector
simultaneously at each step, or update one group of coefficients at a time
using an inexact line search to approximate the optimal value for the group of
coefficients when all other groups' coefficients are fixed. We present a new
method of computation for the group lasso in the linear regression case, the
Single Line Search (SLS) algorithm, which operates by computing the exact
optimal value for each group (when all other coefficients are fixed) with one
univariate line search. We perform simulations demonstrating that the SLS
algorithm is often more efficient than existing computational methods. We also
extend the SLS algorithm to the sparse group lasso problem via the Signed
Single Line Search (SSLS) algorithm, and give theoretical results to support
both algorithms.
