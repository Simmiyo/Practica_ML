A Statistical Learning Theory Framework for Supervised Pattern Discovery
This paper formalizes a latent variable inference problem we call {\em
supervised pattern discovery}, the goal of which is to find sets of
observations that belong to a single ``pattern.'' We discuss two versions of
the problem and prove uniform risk bounds for both. In the first version,
collections of patterns can be generated in an arbitrary manner and the data
consist of multiple labeled collections. In the second version, the patterns
are assumed to be generated independently by identically distributed processes.
These processes are allowed to take an arbitrary form, so observations within a
pattern are not in general independent of each other. The bounds for the second
version of the problem are stated in terms of a new complexity measure, the
quasi-Rademacher complexity.
