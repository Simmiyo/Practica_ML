On Constrained Spectral Clustering and Its Applications
Constrained clustering has been well-studied for algorithms such as $K$-means
and hierarchical clustering. However, how to satisfy many constraints in these
algorithmic settings has been shown to be intractable. One alternative to
encode many constraints is to use spectral clustering, which remains a
developing area. In this paper, we propose a flexible framework for constrained
spectral clustering. In contrast to some previous efforts that implicitly
encode Must-Link and Cannot-Link constraints by modifying the graph Laplacian
or constraining the underlying eigenspace, we present a more natural and
principled formulation, which explicitly encodes the constraints as part of a
constrained optimization problem. Our method offers several practical
advantages: it can encode the degree of belief in Must-Link and Cannot-Link
constraints; it guarantees to lower-bound how well the given constraints are
satisfied using a user-specified threshold; it can be solved deterministically
in polynomial time through generalized eigendecomposition. Furthermore, by
inheriting the objective function from spectral clustering and encoding the
constraints explicitly, much of the existing analysis of unconstrained spectral
clustering techniques remains valid for our formulation. We validate the
effectiveness of our approach by empirical results on both artificial and real
datasets. We also demonstrate an innovative use of encoding large number of
constraints: transfer learning via constraints.
