Online Censoring for Large-Scale Regressions with Application to
  Streaming Big Data
Linear regression is arguably the most prominent among statistical inference
methods, popular both for its simplicity as well as its broad applicability. On
par with data-intensive applications, the sheer size of linear regression
problems creates an ever growing demand for quick and cost efficient solvers.
Fortunately, a significant percentage of the data accrued can be omitted while
maintaining a certain quality of statistical inference with an affordable
computational budget. The present paper introduces means of identifying and
omitting "less informative" observations in an online and data-adaptive
fashion, built on principles of stochastic approximation and data censoring.
First- and second-order stochastic approximation maximum likelihood-based
algorithms for censored observations are developed for estimating the
regression coefficients. Online algorithms are also put forth to reduce the
overall complexity by adaptively performing censoring along with estimation.
The novel algorithms entail simple closed-form updates, and have provable
(non)asymptotic convergence guarantees. Furthermore, specific rules are
investigated for tuning to desired censoring patterns and levels of
dimensionality reduction. Simulated tests on real and synthetic datasets
corroborate the efficacy of the proposed data-adaptive methods compared to
data-agnostic random projection-based alternatives.
