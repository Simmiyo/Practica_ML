Decentralized Dynamic Discriminative Dictionary Learning
We consider discriminative dictionary learning in a distributed online
setting, where a network of agents aims to learn a common set of dictionary
elements of a feature space and model parameters while sequentially receiving
observations. We formulate this problem as a distributed stochastic program
with a non-convex objective and present a block variant of the Arrow-Hurwicz
saddle point algorithm to solve it. Using Lagrange multipliers to penalize the
discrepancy between them, only neighboring nodes exchange model information. We
show that decisions made with this saddle point algorithm asymptotically
achieve a first-order stationarity condition on average.
