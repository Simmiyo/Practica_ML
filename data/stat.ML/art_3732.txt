Estimation of the sample covariance matrix from compressive measurements
This paper focuses on the estimation of the sample covariance matrix from
low-dimensional random projections of data known as compressive measurements.
In particular, we present an unbiased estimator to extract the covariance
structure from compressive measurements obtained by a general class of random
projection matrices consisting of i.i.d. zero-mean entries and finite first
four moments. In contrast to previous works, we make no structural assumptions
about the underlying covariance matrix such as being low-rank. In fact, our
analysis is based on a non-Bayesian data setting which requires no
distributional assumptions on the set of data samples. Furthermore, inspired by
the generality of the projection matrices, we propose an approach to covariance
estimation that utilizes sparse Rademacher matrices. Therefore, our algorithm
can be used to estimate the covariance matrix in applications with limited
memory and computation power at the acquisition devices. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach allows for accurate estimation of the sample
covariance matrix on several real-world data sets, including video data.
