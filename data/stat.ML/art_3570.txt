Empirical Analysis of Sampling Based Estimators for Evaluating RBMs
The Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) can be used either as classifiers or
as generative models. The quality of the generative RBM is measured through the
average log-likelihood on test data. Due to the high computational complexity
of evaluating the partition function, exact calculation of test log-likelihood
is very difficult. In recent years some estimation methods are suggested for
approximate computation of test log-likelihood. In this paper we present an
empirical comparison of the main estimation methods, namely, the AIS algorithm
for estimating the partition function, the CSL method for directly estimating
the log-likelihood, and the RAISE algorithm that combines these two ideas. We
use the MNIST data set to learn the RBM and then compare these methods for
estimating the test log-likelihood.
