Sparse Probit Linear Mixed Model
Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) are important tools in statistical genetics. When
used for feature selection, they allow to find a sparse set of genetic traits
that best predict a continuous phenotype of interest, while simultaneously
correcting for various confounding factors such as age, ethnicity and
population structure. Formulated as models for linear regression, LMMs have
been restricted to continuous phenotypes. We introduce the Sparse Probit Linear
Mixed Model (Probit-LMM), where we generalize the LMM modeling paradigm to
binary phenotypes. As a technical challenge, the model no longer possesses a
closed-form likelihood function. In this paper, we present a scalable
approximate inference algorithm that lets us fit the model to high-dimensional
data sets. We show on three real-world examples from different domains that in
the setup of binary labels, our algorithm leads to better prediction accuracies
and also selects features which show less correlation with the confounding
factors.
