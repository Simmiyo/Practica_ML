Finding Statistically Significant Attribute Interactions
In many data exploration tasks it is meaningful to identify groups of
attribute interactions that are specific to a variable of interest. For
instance, in a dataset where the attributes are medical markers and the
variable of interest (class variable) is binary indicating presence/absence of
disease, we would like to know which medical markers interact with respect to
the binary class label. These interactions are useful in several practical
applications, for example, to gain insight into the structure of the data, in
feature selection, and in data anonymisation. We present a novel method, based
on statistical significance testing, that can be used to verify if the data set
has been created by a given factorised class-conditional joint distribution,
where the distribution is parametrised by a partition of its attributes.
Furthermore, we provide a method, named ASTRID, for automatically finding a
partition of attributes describing the distribution that has generated the
data. State-of-the-art classifiers are utilised to capture the interactions
present in the data by systematically breaking attribute interactions and
observing the effect of this breaking on classifier performance. We empirically
demonstrate the utility of the proposed method with examples using real and
synthetic data.
