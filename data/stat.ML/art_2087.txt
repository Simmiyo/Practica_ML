Predictive Approaches For Gaussian Process Classifier Model Selection
In this paper we consider the problem of Gaussian process classifier (GPC)
model selection with different Leave-One-Out (LOO) Cross Validation (CV) based
optimization criteria and provide a practical algorithm using LOO predictive
distributions with such criteria to select hyperparameters. Apart from the
standard average negative logarithm of predictive probability (NLP), we also
consider smoothed versions of criteria such as F-measure and Weighted Error
Rate (WER), which are useful for handling imbalanced data. Unlike the
regression case, LOO predictive distributions for the classifier case are
intractable. We use approximate LOO predictive distributions arrived from
Expectation Propagation (EP) approximation. We conduct experiments on several
real world benchmark datasets. When the NLP criterion is used for optimizing
the hyperparameters, the predictive approaches show better or comparable NLP
generalization performance with existing GPC approaches. On the other hand,
when the F-measure criterion is used, the F-measure generalization performance
improves significantly on several datasets. Overall, the EP-based predictive
algorithm comes out as an excellent choice for GP classifier model selection
with different optimization criteria.
