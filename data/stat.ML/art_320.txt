Dependence Measure for non-additive model
We proposed a new statistical dependency measure called Copula Dependency
Coefficient(CDC) for two sets of variables based on copula. It is robust to
outliers, easy to implement, powerful and appropriate to high-dimensional
variables. These properties are important in many applications. Experimental
results show that CDC can detect the dependence between variables in both
additive and non-additive models.
