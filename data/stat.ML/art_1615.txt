Sparse partial least squares for on-line variable selection in
  multivariate data streams
In this paper we propose a computationally efficient algorithm for on-line
variable selection in multivariate regression problems involving high
dimensional data streams. The algorithm recursively extracts all the latent
factors of a partial least squares solution and selects the most important
variables for each factor. This is achieved by means of only one sparse
singular value decomposition which can be efficiently updated on-line and in an
adaptive fashion. Simulation results based on artificial data streams
demonstrate that the algorithm is able to select important variables in dynamic
settings where the correlation structure among the observed streams is governed
by a few hidden components and the importance of each variable changes over
time. We also report on an application of our algorithm to a multivariate
version of the "enhanced index tracking" problem using financial data streams.
The application consists of performing on-line asset allocation with the
objective of overperforming two benchmark indices simultaneously.
