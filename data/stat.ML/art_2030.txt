Small Sample Inference for Generalization Error in Classification Using
  the CUD Bound
Confidence measures for the generalization error are crucial when small
training samples are used to construct classifiers. A common approach is to
estimate the generalization error by resampling and then assume the resampled
estimator follows a known distribution to form a confidence set [Kohavi 1995,
Martin 1996,Yang 2006]. Alternatively, one might bootstrap the resampled
estimator of the generalization error to form a confidence set. Unfortunately,
these methods do not reliably provide sets of the desired confidence. The poor
performance appears to be due to the lack of smoothness of the generalization
error as a function of the learned classifier. This results in a non-normal
distribution of the estimated generalization error. We construct a confidence
set for the generalization error by use of a smooth upper bound on the
deviation between the resampled estimate and generalization error. The
confidence set is formed by bootstrapping this upper bound. In cases in which
the approximation class for the classifier can be represented as a parametric
additive model, we provide a computationally efficient algorithm. This method
exhibits superior performance across a series of test and simulated data sets.
