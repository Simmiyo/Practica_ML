Dependence Maximizing Temporal Alignment via Squared-Loss Mutual
  Information
The goal of temporal alignment is to establish time correspondence between
two sequences, which has many applications in a variety of areas such as speech
processing, bioinformatics, computer vision, and computer graphics. In this
paper, we propose a novel temporal alignment method called least-squares
dynamic time warping (LSDTW). LSDTW finds an alignment that maximizes
statistical dependency between sequences, measured by a squared-loss variant of
mutual information. The benefit of this novel information-theoretic formulation
is that LSDTW can align sequences with different lengths, different
dimensionality, high non-linearity, and non-Gaussianity in a computationally
efficient manner. In addition, model parameters such as an initial alignment
matrix can be systematically optimized by cross-validation. We demonstrate the
usefulness of LSDTW through experiments on synthetic and real-world Kinect
action recognition datasets.
