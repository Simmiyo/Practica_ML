Tightening Fractional Covering Upper Bounds on the Partition Function
  for High-Order Region Graphs
In this paper we present a new approach for tightening upper bounds on the
partition function. Our upper bounds are based on fractional covering bounds on
the entropy function, and result in a concave program to compute these bounds
and a convex program to tighten them. To solve these programs effectively for
general region graphs we utilize the entropy barrier method, thus decomposing
the original programs by their dual programs and solve them with dual block
optimization scheme. The entropy barrier method provides an elegant framework
to generalize the message-passing scheme to high-order region graph, as well as
to solve the block dual steps in closed-form. This is a key for computational
relevancy for large problems with thousands of regions.
