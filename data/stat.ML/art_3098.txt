Nonnegative Tensor Factorization for Directional Blind Audio Source
  Separation
We augment the nonnegative matrix factorization method for audio source
separation with cues about directionality of sound propagation. This improves
separation quality greatly and removes the need for training data, with only a
twofold increase in run time. This is the first method which can exploit
directional information from microphone arrays much smaller than the wavelength
of sound, working both in simulation and in practice on millimeter-scale
microphone arrays.
