Freeze-Thaw Bayesian Optimization
In this paper we develop a dynamic form of Bayesian optimization for machine
learning models with the goal of rapidly finding good hyperparameter settings.
Our method uses the partial information gained during the training of a machine
learning model in order to decide whether to pause training and start a new
model, or resume the training of a previously-considered model. We specifically
tailor our method to machine learning problems by developing a novel
positive-definite covariance kernel to capture a variety of training curves.
Furthermore, we develop a Gaussian process prior that scales gracefully with
additional temporal observations. Finally, we provide an information-theoretic
framework to automate the decision process. Experiments on several common
machine learning models show that our approach is extremely effective in
practice.
