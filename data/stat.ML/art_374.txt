Nonparametric Latent Tree Graphical Models: Inference, Estimation, and
  Structure Learning
Tree structured graphical models are powerful at expressing long range or
hierarchical dependency among many variables, and have been widely applied in
different areas of computer science and statistics. However, existing methods
for parameter estimation, inference, and structure learning mainly rely on the
Gaussian or discrete assumptions, which are restrictive under many
applications. In this paper, we propose new nonparametric methods based on
reproducing kernel Hilbert space embeddings of distributions that can recover
the latent tree structures, estimate the parameters, and perform inference for
high dimensional continuous and non-Gaussian variables. The usefulness of the
proposed methods are illustrated by thorough numerical results.
