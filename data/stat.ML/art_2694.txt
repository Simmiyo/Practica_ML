Domain Adaptation of Majority Votes via Perturbed Variation-based Label
  Transfer
We tackle the PAC-Bayesian Domain Adaptation (DA) problem. This arrives when
one desires to learn, from a source distribution, a good weighted majority vote
(over a set of classifiers) on a different target distribution. In this
context, the disagreement between classifiers is known crucial to control. In
non-DA supervised setting, a theoretical bound - the C-bound - involves this
disagreement and leads to a majority vote learning algorithm: MinCq. In this
work, we extend MinCq to DA by taking advantage of an elegant divergence
between distribution called the Perturbed Varation (PV). Firstly, justified by
a new formulation of the C-bound, we provide to MinCq a target sample labeled
thanks to a PV-based self-labeling focused on regions where the source and
target marginal distributions are closer. Secondly, we propose an original
process for tuning the hyperparameters. Our framework shows very promising
results on a toy problem.
