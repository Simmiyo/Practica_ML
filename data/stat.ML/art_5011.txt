Very Simple Classifier: a Concept Binary Classifier toInvestigate
  Features Based on Subsampling and Localility
We propose Very Simple Classifier (VSC) a novel method designed to
incorporate the concepts of subsampling and locality in the definition of
features to be used as the input of a perceptron. The rationale is that
locality theoretically guarantees a bound on the generalization error. Each
feature in VSC is a max-margin classifier built on randomly-selected pairs of
samples. The locality in VSC is achieved by multiplying the value of the
feature by a confidence measure that can be characterized in terms of the
Chebichev inequality. The output of the layer is then fed in a output layer of
neurons. The weights of the output layer are then determined by a regularized
pseudoinverse. Extensive comparison of VSC against 9 competitors in the task of
binary classification is carried out. Results on 22 benchmark datasets with
fixed parameters show that VSC is competitive with the Multi Layer Perceptron
(MLP) and outperforms the other competitors. An exploration of the parameter
space shows VSC can outperform MLP.
