Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for identification of unknown number of
  sources emitting delayed signals
Factor analysis is broadly used as a powerful unsupervised machine learning
tool for reconstruction of hidden features in recorded mixtures of signals. In
the case of a linear approximation, the mixtures can be decomposed by a variety
of model-free Blind Source Separation (BSS) algorithms. Most of the available
BSS algorithms consider an instantaneous mixing of signals, while the case when
the mixtures are linear combinations of signals with delays is less explored.
Especially difficult is the case when the number of sources of the signals with
delays is unknown and has to be determined from the data as well. To address
this problem, in this paper, we present a new method based on Nonnegative
Matrix Factorization (NMF) that is capable of identifying: (a) the unknown
number of the sources, (b) the delays and speed of propagation of the signals,
and (c) the locations of the sources. Our method can be used to decompose
records of mixtures of signals with delays emitted by an unknown number of
sources in a nondispersive medium, based only on recorded data. This is the
case, for example, when electromagnetic signals from multiple antennas are
received asynchronously; or mixtures of acoustic or seismic signals recorded by
sensors located at different positions; or when a shift in frequency is induced
by the Doppler effect. By applying our method to synthetic datasets, we
demonstrate its ability to identify the unknown number of sources as well as
the waveforms, the delays, and the strengths of the signals. Using Bayesian
analysis, we also evaluate estimation uncertainties and identify the region of
likelihood where the positions of the sources can be found.
