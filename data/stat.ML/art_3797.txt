Identifiability Assumptions and Algorithm for Directed Graphical Models
  with Feedback
Directed graphical models provide a useful framework for modeling causal or
directional relationships for multivariate data. Prior work has largely focused
on identifiability and search algorithms for directed acyclic graphical (DAG)
models. In many applications, feedback naturally arises and directed graphical
models that permit cycles occur. In this paper we address the issue of
identifiability for general directed cyclic graphical (DCG) models satisfying
the Markov assumption. In particular, in addition to the faithfulness
assumption which has already been introduced for cyclic models, we introduce
two new identifiability assumptions, one based on selecting the model with the
fewest edges and the other based on selecting the DCG model that entails the
maximum number of d-separation rules. We provide theoretical results comparing
these assumptions which show that: (1) selecting models with the largest number
of d-separation rules is strictly weaker than the faithfulness assumption; (2)
unlike for DAG models, selecting models with the fewest edges does not
necessarily result in a milder assumption than the faithfulness assumption. We
also provide connections between our two new principles and minimality
assumptions. We use our identifiability assumptions to develop search
algorithms for small-scale DCG models. Our simulation study supports our
theoretical results, showing that the algorithms based on our two new
principles generally out-perform algorithms based on the faithfulness
assumption in terms of selecting the true skeleton for DCG models.
