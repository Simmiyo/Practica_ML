A Tutorial on Independent Component Analysis
Independent component analysis (ICA) has become a standard data analysis
technique applied to an array of problems in signal processing and machine
learning. This tutorial provides an introduction to ICA based on linear algebra
formulating an intuition for ICA from first principles. The goal of this
tutorial is to provide a solid foundation on this advanced topic so that one
might learn the motivation behind ICA, learn why and when to apply this
technique and in the process gain an introduction to this exciting field of
active research.
