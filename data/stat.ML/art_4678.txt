Support Vector Algorithms for Optimizing the Partial Area Under the ROC
  Curve
The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a widely used performance measure in
machine learning. Increasingly, however, in several applications, ranging from
ranking to biometric screening to medicine, performance is measured not in
terms of the full area under the ROC curve, but in terms of the \emph{partial}
area under the ROC curve between two false positive rates. In this paper, we
develop support vector algorithms for directly optimizing the partial AUC
between any two false positive rates. Our methods are based on minimizing a
suitable proxy or surrogate objective for the partial AUC error. In the case of
the full AUC, one can readily construct and optimize convex surrogates by
expressing the performance measure as a summation of pairwise terms. The
partial AUC, on the other hand, does not admit such a simple decomposable
structure, making it more challenging to design and optimize (tight) convex
surrogates for this measure.
  Our approach builds on the structural SVM framework of Joachims (2005) to
design convex surrogates for partial AUC, and solves the resulting optimization
problem using a cutting plane solver. Unlike the full AUC, where the
combinatorial optimization needed in each iteration of the cutting plane solver
can be decomposed and solved efficiently, the corresponding problem for the
partial AUC is harder to decompose. One of our main contributions is a
polynomial time algorithm for solving the combinatorial optimization problem
associated with partial AUC. We also develop an approach for optimizing a
tighter non-convex hinge loss based surrogate for the partial AUC using
difference-of-convex programming. Our experiments on a variety of real-world
and benchmark tasks confirm the efficacy of the proposed methods.
