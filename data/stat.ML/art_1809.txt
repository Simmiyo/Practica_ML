A Reliable Effective Terascale Linear Learning System
We present a system and a set of techniques for learning linear predictors
with convex losses on terascale datasets, with trillions of features, {The
number of features here refers to the number of non-zero entries in the data
matrix.} billions of training examples and millions of parameters in an hour
using a cluster of 1000 machines. Individually none of the component techniques
are new, but the careful synthesis required to obtain an efficient
implementation is. The result is, up to our knowledge, the most scalable and
efficient linear learning system reported in the literature (as of 2011 when
our experiments were conducted). We describe and thoroughly evaluate the
components of the system, showing the importance of the various design choices.
