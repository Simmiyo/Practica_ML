Screening Rules for Overlapping Group Lasso
Recently, to solve large-scale lasso and group lasso problems, screening
rules have been developed, the goal of which is to reduce the problem size by
efficiently discarding zero coefficients using simple rules independently of
the others. However, screening for overlapping group lasso remains an open
challenge because the overlaps between groups make it infeasible to test each
group independently. In this paper, we develop screening rules for overlapping
group lasso. To address the challenge arising from groups with overlaps, we
take into account overlapping groups only if they are inclusive of the group
being tested, and then we derive screening rules, adopting the dual polytope
projection approach. This strategy allows us to screen each group independently
of each other. In our experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency of our
screening rules on various datasets.
