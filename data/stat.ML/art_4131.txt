InfiniteBoost: building infinite ensembles with gradient descent
In machine learning ensemble methods have demonstrated high accuracy for the
variety of problems in different areas. Two notable ensemble methods widely
used in practice are gradient boosting and random forests. In this paper we
present InfiniteBoost - a novel algorithm, which combines important properties
of these two approaches. The algorithm constructs the ensemble of trees for
which two properties hold: trees of the ensemble incorporate the mistakes done
by others; at the same time the ensemble could contain the infinite number of
trees without the over-fitting effect. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on
the regression, classification, and ranking tasks using large scale, publicly
available datasets.
