Quantized Matrix Completion for Personalized Learning
The recently proposed SPARse Factor Analysis (SPARFA) framework for
personalized learning performs factor analysis on ordinal or binary-valued
(e.g., correct/incorrect) graded learner responses to questions. The underlying
factors are termed "concepts" (or knowledge components) and are used for
learning analytics (LA), the estimation of learner concept-knowledge profiles,
and for content analytics (CA), the estimation of question-concept associations
and question difficulties. While SPARFA is a powerful tool for LA and CA, it
requires a number of algorithm parameters (including the number of concepts),
which are difficult to determine in practice. In this paper, we propose
SPARFA-Lite, a convex optimization-based method for LA that builds on matrix
completion, which only requires a single algorithm parameter and enables us to
automatically identify the required number of concepts. Using a variety of
educational datasets, we demonstrate that SPARFALite (i) achieves comparable
performance in predicting unobserved learner responses to existing methods,
including item response theory (IRT) and SPARFA, and (ii) is computationally
more efficient.
