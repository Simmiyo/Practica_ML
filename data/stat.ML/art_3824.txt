Feature ranking for multi-label classification using Markov Networks
We propose a simple and efficient method for ranking features in multi-label
classification. The method produces a ranking of features showing their
relevance in predicting labels, which in turn allows to choose a final subset
of features. The procedure is based on Markov Networks and allows to model the
dependencies between labels and features in a direct way. In the first step we
build a simple network using only labels and then we test how much adding a
single feature affects the initial network. More specifically, in the first
step we use the Ising model whereas the second step is based on the score
statistic, which allows to test a significance of added features very quickly.
The proposed approach does not require transformation of label space, gives
interpretable results and allows for attractive visualization of dependency
structure. We give a theoretical justification of the procedure by discussing
some theoretical properties of the Ising model and the score statistic. We also
discuss feature ranking procedure based on fitting Ising model using $l_1$
regularized logistic regressions. Numerical experiments show that the proposed
methods outperform the conventional approaches on the considered artificial and
real datasets.
