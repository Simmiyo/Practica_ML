Cross-scale predictive dictionaries
Sparse representations using data dictionaries provide an efficient model
particularly for signals that do not enjoy alternate analytic sparsifying
transformations. However, solving inverse problems with sparsifying
dictionaries can be computationally expensive, especially when the dictionary
under consideration has a large number of atoms. In this paper, we incorporate
additional structure on to dictionary-based sparse representations for visual
signals to enable speedups when solving sparse approximation problems. The
specific structure that we endow onto sparse models is that of a multi-scale
modeling where the sparse representation at each scale is constrained by the
sparse representation at coarser scales. We show that this cross-scale
predictive model delivers significant speedups, often in the range of
10-60$\times$, with little loss in accuracy for linear inverse problems
associated with images, videos, and light fields.
