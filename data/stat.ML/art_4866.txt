Learning Shallow Detection Cascades for Wearable Sensor-Based Mobile
  Health Applications
The field of mobile health aims to leverage recent advances in wearable
on-body sensing technology and smart phone computing capabilities to develop
systems that can monitor health states and deliver just-in-time adaptive
interventions. However, existing work has largely focused on analyzing
collected data in the off-line setting. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach to learning shallow detection cascades developed explicitly for use in
a real-time wearable-phone or wearable-phone-cloud systems. We apply our
approach to the problem of cigarette smoking detection from a combination of
wrist-worn actigraphy data and respiration chest band data using two and three
stage cascades.
