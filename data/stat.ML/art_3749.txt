A Framework for Fast Image Deconvolution with Incomplete Observations
In image deconvolution problems, the diagonalization of the underlying
operators by means of the FFT usually yields very large speedups. When there
are incomplete observations (e.g., in the case of unknown boundaries), standard
deconvolution techniques normally involve non-diagonalizable operators,
resulting in rather slow methods, or, otherwise, use inexact convolution
models, resulting in the occurrence of artifacts in the enhanced images. In
this paper, we propose a new deconvolution framework for images with incomplete
observations that allows us to work with diagonalized convolution operators,
and therefore is very fast. We iteratively alternate the estimation of the
unknown pixels and of the deconvolved image, using, e.g., an FFT-based
deconvolution method. This framework is an efficient, high-quality alternative
to existing methods of dealing with the image boundaries, such as edge
tapering. It can be used with any fast deconvolution method. We give an example
in which a state-of-the-art method that assumes periodic boundary conditions is
extended, through the use of this framework, to unknown boundary conditions.
Furthermore, we propose a specific implementation of this framework, based on
the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We provide a proof of
convergence for the resulting algorithm, which can be seen as a "partial" ADMM,
in which not all variables are dualized. We report experimental comparisons
with other primal-dual methods, where the proposed one performed at the level
of the state of the art. Four different kinds of applications were tested in
the experiments: deconvolution, deconvolution with inpainting, superresolution,
and demosaicing, all with unknown boundaries.
