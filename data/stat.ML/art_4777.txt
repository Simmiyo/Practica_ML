Masking Strategies for Image Manifolds
We consider the problem of selecting an optimal mask for an image manifold,
i.e., choosing a subset of the pixels of the image that preserves the
manifold's geometric structure present in the original data. Such masking
implements a form of compressive sensing through emerging imaging sensor
platforms for which the power expense grows with the number of pixels acquired.
Our goal is for the manifold learned from masked images to resemble its full
image counterpart as closely as possible. More precisely, we show that one can
indeed accurately learn an image manifold without having to consider a large
majority of the image pixels. In doing so, we consider two masking methods that
preserve the local and global geometric structure of the manifold,
respectively. In each case, the process of finding the optimal masking pattern
can be cast as a binary integer program, which is computationally expensive but
can be approximated by a fast greedy algorithm. Numerical experiments show that
the relevant manifold structure is preserved through the data-dependent masking
process, even for modest mask sizes.
