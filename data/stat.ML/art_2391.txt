Approximate Learning in Complex Dynamic Bayesian Networks
In this paper we extend the work of Smith and Papamichail (1999) and present
fast approximate Bayesian algorithms for learning in complex scenarios where at
any time frame, the relationships between explanatory state space variables can
be described by a Bayesian network that evolve dynamically over time and the
observations taken are not necessarily Gaussian. It uses recent developments in
approximate Bayesian forecasting methods in combination with more familiar
Gaussian propagation algorithms on junction trees. The procedure for learning
state parameters from data is given explicitly for common sampling
distributions and the methodology is illustrated through a real application.
The efficiency of the dynamic approximation is explored by using the Hellinger
divergence measure and theoretical bounds for the efficacy of such a procedure
are discussed.
