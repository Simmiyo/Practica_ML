Analog Sparse Approximation with Applications to Compressed Sensing
Recent research has shown that performance in signal processing tasks can
often be significantly improved by using signal models based on sparse
representations, where a signal is approximated using a small number of
elements from a fixed dictionary. Unfortunately, inference in this model
involves solving non-smooth optimization problems that are computationally
expensive. While significant efforts have focused on developing digital
algorithms specifically for this problem, these algorithms are inappropriate
for many applications because of the time and power requirements necessary to
solve large optimization problems. Based on recent work in computational
neuroscience, we explore the potential advantages of continuous time dynamical
systems for solving sparse approximation problems if they were implemented in
analog VLSI. Specifically, in the simulated task of recovering synthetic and
MRI data acquired via compressive sensing techniques, we show that these
systems can potentially perform recovery at time scales of 10-20{\mu}s,
supporting datarates of 50-100 kHz (orders of magnitude faster that digital
algorithms). Furthermore, we show analytically that a wide range of sparse
approximation problems can be solved in the same basic architecture, including
approximate $\ell^p$ norms, modified $\ell^1$ norms, re-weighted $\ell^1$ and
$\ell^2$, the block $\ell^1$ norm and classic Tikhonov regularization.
