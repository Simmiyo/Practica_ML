Multi-rank Sparse Hierarchical Clustering
There has been a surge in the number of large and flat data sets - data sets
containing a large number of features and a relatively small number of
observations - due to the growing ability to collect and store information in
medical research and other fields. Hierarchical clustering is a widely used
clustering tool. In hierarchical clustering, large and flat data sets may allow
for a better coverage of clustering features (features that help explain the
true underlying clusters) but, such data sets usually include a large fraction
of noise features (non-clustering features) that may hide the underlying
clusters. Witten and Tibshirani (2010) proposed a sparse hierarchical
clustering framework to cluster the observations using an adaptively chosen
subset of the features, however, we show that this framework has some
limitations when the data sets contain clustering features with complex
structure. In this paper, we propose the Multi-rank sparse hierarchical
clustering (MrSHC). We show that, using simulation studies and real data
examples, MrSHC produces superior feature selection and clustering performance
comparing to the classical (of-the-shelf) hierarchical clustering and the
existing sparse hierarchical clustering framework.
