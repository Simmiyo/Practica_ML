Inference in Kingman's Coalescent with Particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo
  Method
We propose a new algorithm to do posterior sampling of Kingman's coalescent,
based upon the Particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo methodology. Specifically, the
algorithm is an instantiation of the Particle Gibbs Sampling method, which
alternately samples coalescent times conditioned on coalescent tree structures,
and tree structures conditioned on coalescent times via the conditional
Sequential Monte Carlo procedure. We implement our algorithm as a C++ package,
and demonstrate its utility via a parameter estimation task in population
genetics on both single- and multiple-locus data. The experiment results show
that the proposed algorithm performs comparable to or better than several
well-developed methods.
