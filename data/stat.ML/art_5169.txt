An Interval-Based Bayesian Generative Model for Human Complex Activity
  Recognition
Complex activity recognition is challenging due to the inherent uncertainty
and diversity of performing a complex activity. Normally, each instance of a
complex activity has its own configuration of atomic actions and their temporal
dependencies. We propose in this paper an atomic action-based Bayesian model
that constructs Allen's interval relation networks to characterize complex
activities with structural varieties in a probabilistic generative way: By
introducing latent variables from the Chinese restaurant process, our approach
is able to capture all possible styles of a particular complex activity as a
unique set of distributions over atomic actions and relations. We also show
that local temporal dependencies can be retained and are globally consistent in
the resulting interval network. Moreover, network structure can be learned from
empirical data. A new dataset of complex hand activities has been constructed
and made publicly available, which is much larger in size than any existing
datasets. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets as well as our in-house
dataset demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach.
