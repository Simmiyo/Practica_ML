Probabilistic coherence and proper scoring rules
We provide self-contained proof of a theorem relating probabilistic coherence
of forecasts to their non-domination by rival forecasts with respect to any
proper scoring rule. The theorem appears to be new but is closely related to
results achieved by other investigators.
