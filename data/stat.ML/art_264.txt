Expectation Propagation for Neural Networks with Sparsity-promoting
  Priors
We propose a novel approach for nonlinear regression using a two-layer neural
network (NN) model structure with sparsity-favoring hierarchical priors on the
network weights. We present an expectation propagation (EP) approach for
approximate integration over the posterior distribution of the weights, the
hierarchical scale parameters of the priors, and the residual scale. Using a
factorized posterior approximation we derive a computationally efficient
algorithm, whose complexity scales similarly to an ensemble of independent
sparse linear models. The approach enables flexible definition of weight priors
with different sparseness properties such as independent Laplace priors with a
common scale parameter or Gaussian automatic relevance determination (ARD)
priors with different relevance parameters for all inputs. The approach can be
extended beyond standard activation functions and NN model structures to form
flexible nonlinear predictors from multiple sparse linear models. The effects
of the hierarchical priors and the predictive performance of the algorithm are
assessed using both simulated and real-world data. Comparisons are made to two
alternative models with ARD priors: a Gaussian process with a NN covariance
function and marginal maximum a posteriori estimates of the relevance
parameters, and a NN with Markov chain Monte Carlo integration over all the
unknown model parameters.
