The Cluster Graphical Lasso for improved estimation of Gaussian
  graphical models
We consider the task of estimating a Gaussian graphical model in the
high-dimensional setting. The graphical lasso, which involves maximizing the
Gaussian log likelihood subject to an l1 penalty, is a well-studied approach
for this task. We begin by introducing a surprising connection between the
graphical lasso and hierarchical clustering: the graphical lasso in effect
performs a two-step procedure, in which (1) single linkage hierarchical
clustering is performed on the variables in order to identify connected
components, and then (2) an l1-penalized log likelihood is maximized on the
subset of variables within each connected component. In other words, the
graphical lasso determines the connected components of the estimated network
via single linkage clustering. Unfortunately, single linkage clustering is
known to perform poorly in certain settings. Therefore, we propose the cluster
graphical lasso, which involves clustering the features using an alternative to
single linkage clustering, and then performing the graphical lasso on the
subset of variables within each cluster. We establish model selection
consistency for this technique, and demonstrate its improved performance
relative to the graphical lasso in a simulation study, as well as in
applications to an equities data set, a university webpage data set, and a gene
expression data set.
