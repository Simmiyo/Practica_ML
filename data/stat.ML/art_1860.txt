Information Forests
We describe Information Forests, an approach to classification that
generalizes Random Forests by replacing the splitting criterion of non-leaf
nodes from a discriminative one -- based on the entropy of the label
distribution -- to a generative one -- based on maximizing the information
divergence between the class-conditional distributions in the resulting
partitions. The basic idea consists of deferring classification until a measure
of "classification confidence" is sufficiently high, and instead breaking down
the data so as to maximize this measure. In an alternative interpretation,
Information Forests attempt to partition the data into subsets that are "as
informative as possible" for the purpose of the task, which is to classify the
data. Classification confidence, or informative content of the subsets, is
quantified by the Information Divergence. Our approach relates to active
learning, semi-supervised learning, mixed generative/discriminative learning.
