Nonparametric Bayesian Mixed-effect Model: a Sparse Gaussian Process
  Approach
Multi-task learning models using Gaussian processes (GP) have been developed
and successfully applied in various applications. The main difficulty with this
approach is the computational cost of inference using the union of examples
from all tasks. Therefore sparse solutions, that avoid using the entire data
directly and instead use a set of informative "representatives" are desirable.
The paper investigates this problem for the grouped mixed-effect GP model where
each individual response is given by a fixed-effect, taken from one of a set of
unknown groups, plus a random individual effect function that captures
variations among individuals. Such models have been widely used in previous
work but no sparse solutions have been developed. The paper presents the first
sparse solution for such problems, showing how the sparse approximation can be
obtained by maximizing a variational lower bound on the marginal likelihood,
generalizing ideas from single-task Gaussian processes to handle the
mixed-effect model as well as grouping. Experiments using artificial and real
data validate the approach showing that it can recover the performance of
inference with the full sample, that it outperforms baseline methods, and that
it outperforms state of the art sparse solutions for other multi-task GP
formulations.
