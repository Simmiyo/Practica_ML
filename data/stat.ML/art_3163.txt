Adjusting Leverage Scores by Row Weighting: A Practical Approach to
  Coherent Matrix Completion
Low-rank matrix completion is an important problem with extensive real-world
applications. When observations are uniformly sampled from the underlying
matrix entries, existing methods all require the matrix to be incoherent. This
paper provides the first working method for coherent matrix completion under
the standard uniform sampling model. Our approach is based on the weighted
nuclear norm minimization idea proposed in several recent work, and our key
contribution is a practical method to compute the weighting matrices so that
the leverage scores become more uniform after weighting. Under suitable
conditions, we are able to derive theoretical results, showing the
effectiveness of our approach. Experiments on synthetic data show that our
approach recovers highly coherent matrices with high precision, whereas the
standard unweighted method fails even on noise-free data.
