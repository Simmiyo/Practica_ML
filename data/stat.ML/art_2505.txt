Normalized Online Learning
We introduce online learning algorithms which are independent of feature
scales, proving regret bounds dependent on the ratio of scales existent in the
data rather than the absolute scale. This has several useful effects: there is
no need to pre-normalize data, the test-time and test-space complexity are
reduced, and the algorithms are more robust.
