Gradient-based kernel dimension reduction for supervised learning
This paper proposes a novel kernel approach to linear dimension reduction for
supervised learning. The purpose of the dimension reduction is to find
directions in the input space to explain the output as effectively as possible.
The proposed method uses an estimator for the gradient of regression function,
based on the covariance operators on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. In
comparison with other existing methods, the proposed one has wide applicability
without strong assumptions on the distributions or the type of variables, and
uses computationally simple eigendecomposition. Experimental results show that
the proposed method successfully finds the effective directions with efficient
computation.
