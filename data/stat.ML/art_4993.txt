Functorial Hierarchical Clustering with Overlaps
This work draws inspiration from three important sources of research on
dissimilarity-based clustering and intertwines those three threads into a
consistent principled functorial theory of clustering. Those three are the
overlapping clustering of Jardine and Sibson, the functorial approach of
Carlsson and M\'{e}moli to partition-based clustering, and the Isbell/Dress
school's study of injective envelopes. Carlsson and M\'{e}moli introduce the
idea of viewing clustering methods as functors from a category of metric spaces
to a category of clusters, with functoriality subsuming many desirable
properties. Our first series of results extends their theory of functorial
clustering schemes to methods that allow overlapping clusters in the spirit of
Jardine and Sibson. This obviates some of the unpleasant effects of chaining
that occur, for example with single-linkage clustering. We prove an equivalence
between these general overlapping clustering functors and projections of weight
spaces to what we term clustering domains, by focusing on the order structure
determined by the morphisms. As a specific application of this machinery, we
are able to prove that there are no functorial projections to cut metrics, or
even to tree metrics. Finally, although we focus less on the construction of
clustering methods (clustering domains) derived from injective envelopes, we
lay out some preliminary results, that hopefully will give a feel for how the
third leg of the stool comes into play.
