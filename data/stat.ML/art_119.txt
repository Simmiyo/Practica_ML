Generation of SAR Image for Real-life Objects using General Purpose EM
  Simulators
In the applications related to airborne radars, simulation has always played
an important role. This is mainly because of the two fold reason of the
unavailability of desired data and the difficulty associated with the
collection of data under controlled environment. A simple example will be
regarding the collection of pure multipolar radar data. Even after phenomenal
development in the field of radar hardware design and signal processing, till
now the collection of pure multipolar data is a challenge for the radar system
designers. Till very recently, the power of computer simulation of radar signal
return was available to a very selected few. This was because of the heavy cost
associated with some of the main line electro magnetic (EM) simulators for
radar signal simulation, and secondly because many such EM simulators are for
restricted marketting. However, because of the fast progress made in the field
of EM simulation, many of the current generic EM simulators can be used to
simulate radar returns from realistic targets. The current article expounds the
steps towards generating a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image database of
ground targets, using a eneric EM g simulator. It also demonstrates by the help
of some example images, the quality of the SAR mage generated i using a general
purpose EM simulator.
