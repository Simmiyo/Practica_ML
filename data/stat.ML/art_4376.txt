Deep Gaussian Mixture Models
Deep learning is a hierarchical inference method formed by subsequent
multiple layers of learning able to more efficiently describe complex
relationships. In this work, Deep Gaussian Mixture Models are introduced and
discussed. A Deep Gaussian Mixture model (DGMM) is a network of multiple layers
of latent variables, where, at each layer, the variables follow a mixture of
Gaussian distributions. Thus, the deep mixture model consists of a set of
nested mixtures of linear models, which globally provide a nonlinear model able
to describe the data in a very flexible way. In order to avoid
overparameterized solutions, dimension reduction by factor models can be
applied at each layer of the architecture thus resulting in deep mixtures of
factor analysers.
