Learning the Structure for Structured Sparsity
Structured sparsity has recently emerged in statistics, machine learning and
signal processing as a promising paradigm for learning in high-dimensional
settings. All existing methods for learning under the assumption of structured
sparsity rely on prior knowledge on how to weight (or how to penalize)
individual subsets of variables during the subset selection process, which is
not available in general. Inferring group weights from data is a key open
research problem in structured sparsity.In this paper, we propose a Bayesian
approach to the problem of group weight learning. We model the group weights as
hyperparameters of heavy-tailed priors on groups of variables and derive an
approximate inference scheme to infer these hyperparameters. We empirically
show that we are able to recover the model hyperparameters when the data are
generated from the model, and we demonstrate the utility of learning weights in
synthetic and real denoising problems.
