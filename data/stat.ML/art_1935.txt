A Bayesian Matrix Factorization Model for Relational Data
Relational learning can be used to augment one data source with other
correlated sources of information, to improve predictive accuracy. We frame a
large class of relational learning problems as matrix factorization problems,
and propose a hierarchical Bayesian model. Training our Bayesian model using
random-walk Metropolis-Hastings is impractically slow, and so we develop a
block Metropolis-Hastings sampler which uses the gradient and Hessian of the
likelihood to dynamically tune the proposal. We demonstrate that a predictive
model of brain response to stimuli can be improved by augmenting it with side
information about the stimuli.
