An optimal learning method for developing personalized treatment regimes
A treatment regime is a function that maps individual patient information to
a recommended treatment, hence explicitly incorporating the heterogeneity in
need for treatment across individuals. Patient responses are dichotomous and
can be predicted through an unknown relationship that depends on the patient
information and the selected treatment. The goal is to find the treatments that
lead to the best patient responses on average. Each experiment is expensive,
forcing us to learn the most from each experiment. We adopt a Bayesian approach
both to incorporate possible prior information and to update our treatment
regime continuously as information accrues, with the potential to allow smaller
yet more informative trials and for patients to receive better treatment. By
formulating the problem as contextual bandits, we introduce a knowledge
gradient policy to guide the treatment assignment by maximizing the expected
value of information, for which an approximation method is used to overcome
computational challenges. We provide a detailed study on how to make sequential
medical decisions under uncertainty to reduce health care costs on a real world
knee replacement dataset. We use clustering and LASSO to deal with the
intrinsic sparsity in health datasets. We show experimentally that even though
the problem is sparse, through careful selection of physicians (versus picking
them at random), we can significantly improve the success rates.
