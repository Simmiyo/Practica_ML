Bayesian Differential Privacy through Posterior Sampling
Differential privacy formalises privacy-preserving mechanisms that provide
access to a database. We pose the question of whether Bayesian inference itself
can be used directly to provide private access to data, with no modification.
The answer is affirmative: under certain conditions on the prior, sampling from
the posterior distribution can be used to achieve a desired level of privacy
and utility. To do so, we generalise differential privacy to arbitrary dataset
metrics, outcome spaces and distribution families. This allows us to also deal
with non-i.i.d or non-tabular datasets. We prove bounds on the sensitivity of
the posterior to the data, which gives a measure of robustness. We also show
how to use posterior sampling to provide differentially private responses to
queries, within a decision-theoretic framework. Finally, we provide bounds on
the utility and on the distinguishability of datasets. The latter are
complemented by a novel use of Le Cam's method to obtain lower bounds. All our
general results hold for arbitrary database metrics, including those for the
common definition of differential privacy. For specific choices of the metric,
we give a number of examples satisfying our assumptions.
