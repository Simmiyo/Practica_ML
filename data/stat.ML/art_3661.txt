Harvesting comparable corpora and mining them for equivalent bilingual
  sentences using statistical classification and analogy- based heuristics
Parallel sentences are a relatively scarce but extremely useful resource for
many applications including cross-lingual retrieval and statistical machine
translation. This research explores our new methodologies for mining such data
from previously obtained comparable corpora. The task is highly practical since
non-parallel multilingual data exist in far greater quantities than parallel
corpora, but parallel sentences are a much more useful resource. Here we
propose a web crawling method for building subject-aligned comparable corpora
from e.g. Wikipedia dumps and Euronews web page. The improvements in machine
translation are shown on Polish-English language pair for various text domains.
We also tested another method of building parallel corpora based on comparable
corpora data. It lets automatically broad existing corpus of sentences from
subject of corpora based on analogies between them.
