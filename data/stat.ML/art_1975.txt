Temporal-Difference Networks for Dynamical Systems with Continuous
  Observations and Actions
Temporal-difference (TD) networks are a class of predictive state
representations that use well-established TD methods to learn models of
partially observable dynamical systems. Previous research with TD networks has
dealt only with dynamical systems with finite sets of observations and actions.
We present an algorithm for learning TD network representations of dynamical
systems with continuous observations and actions. Our results show that the
algorithm is capable of learning accurate and robust models of several noisy
continuous dynamical systems. The algorithm presented here is the first fully
incremental method for learning a predictive representation of a continuous
dynamical system.
