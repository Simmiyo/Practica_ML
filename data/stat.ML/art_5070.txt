Predicting Patient State-of-Health using Sliding Window and Recurrent
  Classifiers
Bedside monitors in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) frequently sound incorrectly,
slowing response times and desensitising nurses to alarms (Chambrin, 2001),
causing true alarms to be missed (Hug et al., 2011). We compare sliding window
predictors with recurrent predictors to classify patient state-of-health from
ICU multivariate time series; we report slightly improved performance for the
RNN for three out of four targets.
