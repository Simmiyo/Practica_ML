The ABACOC Algorithm: a Novel Approach for Nonparametric Classification
  of Data Streams
Stream mining poses unique challenges to machine learning: predictive models
are required to be scalable, incrementally trainable, must remain bounded in
size (even when the data stream is arbitrarily long), and be nonparametric in
order to achieve high accuracy even in complex and dynamic environments.
Moreover, the learning system must be parameterless ---traditional tuning
methods are problematic in streaming settings--- and avoid requiring prior
knowledge of the number of distinct class labels occurring in the stream. In
this paper, we introduce a new algorithmic approach for nonparametric learning
in data streams. Our approach addresses all above mentioned challenges by
learning a model that covers the input space using simple local classifiers.
The distribution of these classifiers dynamically adapts to the local (unknown)
complexity of the classification problem, thus achieving a good balance between
model complexity and predictive accuracy. We design four variants of our
approach of increasing adaptivity. By means of an extensive empirical
evaluation against standard nonparametric baselines, we show state-of-the-art
results in terms of accuracy versus model size. For the variant that imposes a
strict bound on the model size, we show better performance against all other
methods measured at the same model size value. Our empirical analysis is
complemented by a theoretical performance guarantee which does not rely on any
stochastic assumption on the source generating the stream.
