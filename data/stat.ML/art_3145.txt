Data Representation using the Weyl Transform
The Weyl transform is introduced as a rich framework for data representation.
Transform coefficients are connected to the Walsh-Hadamard transform of
multiscale autocorrelations, and different forms of dyadic periodicity in a
signal are shown to appear as different features in its Weyl coefficients. The
Weyl transform has a high degree of symmetry with respect to a large group of
multiscale transformations, which allows compact yet discriminative
representations to be obtained by pooling coefficients. The effectiveness of
the Weyl transform is demonstrated through the example of textured image
classification.
