Random Spanning Trees and the Prediction of Weighted Graphs
We investigate the problem of sequentially predicting the binary labels on
the nodes of an arbitrary weighted graph. We show that, under a suitable
parametrization of the problem, the optimal number of prediction mistakes can
be characterized (up to logarithmic factors) by the cutsize of a random
spanning tree of the graph. The cutsize is induced by the unknown adversarial
labeling of the graph nodes. In deriving our characterization, we obtain a
simple randomized algorithm achieving in expectation the optimal mistake bound
on any polynomially connected weighted graph. Our algorithm draws a random
spanning tree of the original graph and then predicts the nodes of this tree in
constant expected amortized time and linear space. Experiments on real-world
datasets show that our method compares well to both global (Perceptron) and
local (label propagation) methods, while being generally faster in practice.
