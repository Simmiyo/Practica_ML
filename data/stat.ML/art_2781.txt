Dissimilarity-based Ensembles for Multiple Instance Learning
In multiple instance learning, objects are sets (bags) of feature vectors
(instances) rather than individual feature vectors. In this paper we address
the problem of how these bags can best be represented. Two standard approaches
are to use (dis)similarities between bags and prototype bags, or between bags
and prototype instances. The first approach results in a relatively
low-dimensional representation determined by the number of training bags, while
the second approach results in a relatively high-dimensional representation,
determined by the total number of instances in the training set. In this paper
a third, intermediate approach is proposed, which links the two approaches and
combines their strengths. Our classifier is inspired by a random subspace
ensemble, and considers subspaces of the dissimilarity space, defined by
subsets of instances, as prototypes. We provide guidelines for using such an
ensemble, and show state-of-the-art performances on a range of multiple
instance learning problems.
