Large-scale Collaborative Imaging Genetics Studies of Risk Genetic
  Factors for Alzheimer's Disease Across Multiple Institutions
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) offer new opportunities to identify
genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, collaborative
efforts across different institutions emerged that enhance the power of many
existing techniques on individual institution data. However, a major barrier to
collaborative studies of GWAS is that many institutions need to preserve
individual data privacy. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
distributed framework, termed Local Query Model (LQM) to detect risk SNPs for
AD across multiple research institutions. To accelerate the learning process,
we propose a Distributed Enhanced Dual Polytope Projection (D-EDPP) screening
rule to identify irrelevant features and remove them from the optimization. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful run of the
computationally intensive model selection procedure to learn a consistent model
across different institutions without compromising their privacy while ranking
the SNPs that may collectively affect AD. Empirical studies are conducted on
809 subjects with 5.9 million SNP features which are distributed across three
individual institutions. D-EDPP achieved a 66-fold speed-up by effectively
identifying irrelevant features.
