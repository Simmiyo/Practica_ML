A Modified Construction for a Support Vector Classifier to Accommodate
  Class Imbalances
Given a training set with binary classification, the Support Vector Machine
identifies the hyperplane maximizing the margin between the two classes of
training data. This general formulation is useful in that it can be applied
without regard to variance differences between the classes. Ignoring these
differences is not optimal, however, as the general SVM will give the class
with lower variance an unjustifiably wide berth. This increases the chance of
misclassification of the other class and results in an overall loss of
predictive performance. An alternate construction is proposed in which the
margins of the separating hyperplane are different for each class, each
proportional to the standard deviation of its class along the direction
perpendicular to the hyperplane. The construction agrees with the SVM in the
case of equal class variances. This paper will then examine the impact to the
dual representation of the modified constraint equations.
