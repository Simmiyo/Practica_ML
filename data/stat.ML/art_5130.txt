Randomized Clustered Nystrom for Large-Scale Kernel Machines
The Nystrom method has been popular for generating the low-rank approximation
of kernel matrices that arise in many machine learning problems. The
approximation quality of the Nystrom method depends crucially on the number of
selected landmark points and the selection procedure. In this paper, we present
a novel algorithm to compute the optimal Nystrom low-approximation when the
number of landmark points exceed the target rank. Moreover, we introduce a
randomized algorithm for generating landmark points that is scalable to
large-scale data sets. The proposed method performs K-means clustering on
low-dimensional random projections of a data set and, thus, leads to
significant savings for high-dimensional data sets. Our theoretical results
characterize the tradeoffs between the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed
method. Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitive performance as well
as the efficiency of our proposed method.
