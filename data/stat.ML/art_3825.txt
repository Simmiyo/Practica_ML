Asymptotic consistency and order specification for logistic classifier
  chains in multi-label learning
Classifier chains are popular and effective method to tackle a multi-label
classification problem. The aim of this paper is to study the asymptotic
properties of the chain model in which the conditional probabilities are of the
logistic form. In particular we find conditions on the number of labels and the
distribution of feature vector under which the estimated mode of the joint
distribution of labels converges to the true mode. Best of our knowledge, this
important issue has not yet been studied in the context of multi-label
learning. We also investigate how the order of model building in a chain
influences the estimation of the joint distribution of labels. We establish the
link between the problem of incorrect ordering in the chain and incorrect model
specification. We propose a procedure of determining the optimal ordering of
labels in the chain, which is based on using measures of correct specification
and allows to find the ordering such that the consecutive logistic models are
best possibly specified. The other important question raised in this paper is
how accurately can we estimate the joint posterior probability when the
ordering of labels is wrong or the logistic models in the chain are incorrectly
specified. The numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical results.
