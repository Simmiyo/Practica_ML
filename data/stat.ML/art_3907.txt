Automatic Sleep Stage Scoring with Single-Channel EEG Using
  Convolutional Neural Networks
We used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automatic sleep stage
scoring based on single-channel electroencephalography (EEG) to learn
task-specific filters for classification without using prior domain knowledge.
We used an openly available dataset from 20 healthy young adults for evaluation
and applied 20-fold cross-validation. We used class-balanced random sampling
within the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization of the CNN to avoid
skewed performance in favor of the most represented sleep stages. We achieved
high mean F1-score (81%, range 79-83%), mean accuracy across individual sleep
stages (82%, range 80-84%) and overall accuracy (74%, range 71-76%) over all
subjects. By analyzing and visualizing the filters that our CNN learns, we
found that rules learned by the filters correspond to sleep scoring criteria in
the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) manual that human experts follow.
Our method's performance is balanced across classes and our results are
comparable to state-of-the-art methods with hand-engineered features. We show
that, without using prior domain knowledge, a CNN can automatically learn to
distinguish among different normal sleep stages.
