Using Visual Analytics to Interpret Predictive Machine Learning Models
It is commonly believed that increasing the interpretability of a machine
learning model may decrease its predictive power. However, inspecting
input-output relationships of those models using visual analytics, while
treating them as black-box, can help to understand the reasoning behind
outcomes without sacrificing predictive quality. We identify a space of
possible solutions and provide two examples of where such techniques have been
successfully used in practice.
