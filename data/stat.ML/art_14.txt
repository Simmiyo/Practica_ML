Component models for large networks
Being among the easiest ways to find meaningful structure from discrete data,
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and related component models have been
applied widely. They are simple, computationally fast and scalable,
interpretable, and admit nonparametric priors. In the currently popular field
of network modeling, relatively little work has taken uncertainty of data
seriously in the Bayesian sense, and component models have been introduced to
the field only recently, by treating each node as a bag of out-going links. We
introduce an alternative, interaction component model for communities (ICMc),
where the whole network is a bag of links, stemming from different components.
The former finds both disassortative and assortative structure, while the
alternative assumes assortativity and finds community-like structures like the
earlier methods motivated by physics. With Dirichlet Process priors and an
efficient implementation the models are highly scalable, as demonstrated with a
social network from the Last.fm web site, with 670,000 nodes and 1.89 million
links.
