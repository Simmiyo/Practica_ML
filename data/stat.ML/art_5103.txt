Tensor Decompositions via Two-Mode Higher-Order SVD (HOSVD)
Tensor decompositions have rich applications in statistics and machine
learning, and developing efficient, accurate algorithms for the problem has
received much attention recently. Here, we present a new method built on
Kruskal's uniqueness theorem to decompose symmetric, nearly orthogonally
decomposable tensors. Unlike the classical higher-order singular value
decomposition which unfolds a tensor along a single mode, we consider
unfoldings along two modes and use rank-1 constraints to characterize the
underlying components. This tensor decomposition method provably handles a
greater level of noise compared to previous methods and achieves a high
estimation accuracy. Numerical results demonstrate that our algorithm is robust
to various noise distributions and that it performs especially favorably as the
order increases.
