Learning Exponential Families in High-Dimensions: Strong Convexity and
  Sparsity
The versatility of exponential families, along with their attendant convexity
properties, make them a popular and effective statistical model. A central
issue is learning these models in high-dimensions, such as when there is some
sparsity pattern of the optimal parameter. This work characterizes a certain
strong convexity property of general exponential families, which allow their
generalization ability to be quantified. In particular, we show how this
property can be used to analyze generic exponential families under L_1
regularization.
