Predictive Active Set Selection Methods for Gaussian Processes
We propose an active set selection framework for Gaussian process
classification for cases when the dataset is large enough to render its
inference prohibitive. Our scheme consists of a two step alternating procedure
of active set update rules and hyperparameter optimization based upon marginal
likelihood maximization. The active set update rules rely on the ability of the
predictive distributions of a Gaussian process classifier to estimate the
relative contribution of a datapoint when being either included or removed from
the model. This means that we can use it to include points with potentially
high impact to the classifier decision process while removing those that are
less relevant. We introduce two active set rules based on different criteria,
the first one prefers a model with interpretable active set parameters whereas
the second puts computational complexity first, thus a model with active set
parameters that directly control its complexity. We also provide both
theoretical and empirical support for our active set selection strategy being a
good approximation of a full Gaussian process classifier. Our extensive
experiments show that our approach can compete with state-of-the-art
classification techniques with reasonable time complexity. Source code publicly
