CORL: A Continuous-state Offset-dynamics Reinforcement Learner
Continuous state spaces and stochastic, switching dynamics characterize a
number of rich, realworld domains, such as robot navigation across varying
terrain. We describe a reinforcementlearning algorithm for learning in these
domains and prove for certain environments the algorithm is probably
approximately correct with a sample complexity that scales polynomially with
the state-space dimension. Unfortunately, no optimal planning techniques exist
in general for such problems; instead we use fitted value iteration to solve
the learned MDP, and include the error due to approximate planning in our
bounds. Finally, we report an experiment using a robotic car driving over
varying terrain to demonstrate that these dynamics representations adequately
capture real-world dynamics and that our algorithm can be used to efficiently
solve such problems.
