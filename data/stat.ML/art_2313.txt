Markov Random Walk Representations with Continuous Distributions
Representations based on random walks can exploit discrete data distributions
for clustering and classification. We extend such representations from discrete
to continuous distributions. Transition probabilities are now calculated using
a diffusion equation with a diffusion coefficient that inversely depends on the
data density. We relate this diffusion equation to a path integral and derive
the corresponding path probability measure. The framework is useful for
incorporating continuous data densities and prior knowledge.
