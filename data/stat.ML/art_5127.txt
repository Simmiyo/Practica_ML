Hierarchical Partitioning of the Output Space in Multi-label Data
Hierarchy Of Multi-label classifiers (HOMER) is a multi-label learning
algorithm that breaks the initial learning task to several, easier sub-tasks by
first constructing a hierarchy of labels from a given label set and secondly
employing a given base multi-label classifier (MLC) to the resulting
sub-problems. The primary goal is to effectively address class imbalance and
scalability issues that often arise in real-world multi-label classification
problems. In this work, we present the general setup for a HOMER model and a
simple extension of the algorithm that is suited for MLCs that output rankings.
Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of the properties of the algorithm,
both from an aspect of effectiveness and computational complexity. A secondary
contribution involves the presentation of a balanced variant of the k means
algorithm, which serves in the first step of the label hierarchy construction.
We conduct extensive experiments on six real-world datasets, studying
empirically HOMER's parameters and providing examples of instantiations of the
algorithm with different clustering approaches and MLCs, The empirical results
demonstrate a significant improvement over the given base MLC.
