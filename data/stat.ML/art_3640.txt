Deep Kalman Filters
Kalman Filters are one of the most influential models of time-varying
phenomena. They admit an intuitive probabilistic interpretation, have a simple
functional form, and enjoy widespread adoption in a variety of disciplines.
Motivated by recent variational methods for learning deep generative models, we
introduce a unified algorithm to efficiently learn a broad spectrum of Kalman
filters. Of particular interest is the use of temporal generative models for
counterfactual inference. We investigate the efficacy of such models for
counterfactual inference, and to that end we introduce the "Healing MNIST"
dataset where long-term structure, noise and actions are applied to sequences
of digits. We show the efficacy of our method for modeling this dataset. We
further show how our model can be used for counterfactual inference for
patients, based on electronic health record data of 8,000 patients over 4.5
years.
