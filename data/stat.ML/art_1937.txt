Online Semi-Supervised Learning on Quantized Graphs
In this paper, we tackle the problem of online semi-supervised learning
(SSL). When data arrive in a stream, the dual problems of computation and data
storage arise for any SSL method. We propose a fast approximate online SSL
algorithm that solves for the harmonic solution on an approximate graph. We
show, both empirically and theoretically, that good behavior can be achieved by
collapsing nearby points into a set of local "representative points" that
minimize distortion. Moreover, we regularize the harmonic solution to achieve
better stability properties. We apply our algorithm to face recognition and
optical character recognition applications to show that we can take advantage
of the manifold structure to outperform the previous methods. Unlike previous
heuristic approaches, we show that our method yields provable performance
bounds.
