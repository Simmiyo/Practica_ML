Stabilizing Sparse Cox Model using Clinical Structures in Electronic
  Medical Records
Stability in clinical prediction models is crucial for transferability
between studies, yet has received little attention. The problem is paramount in
high dimensional data which invites sparse models with feature selection
capability. We introduce an effective method to stabilize sparse Cox model of
time-to-events using clinical structures inherent in Electronic Medical
Records. Model estimation is stabilized using a feature graph derived from two
types of EMR structures: temporal structure of disease and intervention
recurrences, and hierarchical structure of medical knowledge and practices. We
demonstrate the efficacy of the method in predicting time-to-readmission of
heart failure patients. On two stability measures - the Jaccard index and the
Consistency index - the use of clinical structures significantly increased
feature stability without hurting discriminative power. Our model reported a
competitive AUC of 0.64 (95% CIs: [0.58,0.69]) for 6 months prediction.
