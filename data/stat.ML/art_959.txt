Security Analysis of Online Centroid Anomaly Detection
Security issues are crucial in a number of machine learning applications,
especially in scenarios dealing with human activity rather than natural
phenomena (e.g., information ranking, spam detection, malware detection, etc.).
It is to be expected in such cases that learning algorithms will have to deal
with manipulated data aimed at hampering decision making. Although some
previous work addressed the handling of malicious data in the context of
supervised learning, very little is known about the behavior of anomaly
detection methods in such scenarios. In this contribution we analyze the
performance of a particular method -- online centroid anomaly detection -- in
the presence of adversarial noise. Our analysis addresses the following
security-related issues: formalization of learning and attack processes,
derivation of an optimal attack, analysis of its efficiency and constraints. We
derive bounds on the effectiveness of a poisoning attack against centroid
anomaly under different conditions: bounded and unbounded percentage of
traffic, and bounded false positive rate. Our bounds show that whereas a
poisoning attack can be effectively staged in the unconstrained case, it can be
made arbitrarily difficult (a strict upper bound on the attacker's gain) if
external constraints are properly used. Our experimental evaluation carried out
on real HTTP and exploit traces confirms the tightness of our theoretical
bounds and practicality of our protection mechanisms.
