Generalization and Robustness of Batched Weighted Average Algorithm with
  V-geometrically Ergodic Markov Data
We analyze the generalization and robustness of the batched weighted average
algorithm for V-geometrically ergodic Markov data. This algorithm is a good
alternative to the empirical risk minimization algorithm when the latter
suffers from overfitting or when optimizing the empirical risk is hard. For the
generalization of the algorithm, we prove a PAC-style bound on the training
sample size for the expected $L_1$-loss to converge to the optimal loss when
training data are V-geometrically ergodic Markov chains. For the robustness, we
show that if the training target variable's values contain bounded noise, then
the generalization bound of the algorithm deviates at most by the range of the
noise. Our results can be applied to the regression problem, the classification
problem, and the case where there exists an unknown deterministic target
hypothesis.
