Comparing K-Nearest Neighbors and Potential Energy Method in
  classification problem. A case study using KNN applet by E.M. Mirkes and real
  life benchmark data sets
K-nearest neighbors (KNN) method is used in many supervised learning
classification problems. Potential Energy (PE) method is also developed for
classification problems based on its physical metaphor. The energy potential
used in the experiments are Yukawa potential and Gaussian Potential. In this
paper, I use both applet and MATLAB program with real life benchmark data to
analyze the performances of KNN and PE method in classification problems. The
results show that in general, KNN and PE methods have similar performance. In
particular, PE with Yukawa potential has worse performance than KNN when the
density of the data is higher in the distribution of the database. When the
Gaussian potential is applied, the results from PE and KNN have similar
behavior. The indicators used are correlation coefficients and information
gain.
