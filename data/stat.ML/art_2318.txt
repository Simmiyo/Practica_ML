Learning Measurement Models for Unobserved Variables
Observed associations in a database may be due in whole or part to variations
in unrecorded (latent) variables. Identifying such variables and their causal
relationships with one another is a principal goal in many scientific and
practical domains. Previous work shows that, given a partition of observed
variables such that members of a class share only a single latent common cause,
standard search algorithms for causal Bayes nets can infer structural relations
between latent variables. We introduce an algorithm for discovering such
partitions when they exist. Uniquely among available procedures, the algorithm
is (asymptotically) correct under standard assumptions in causal Bayes net
search algorithms, requires no prior knowledge of the number of latent
variables, and does not depend on the mathematical form of the relationships
among the latent variables. We evaluate the algorithm on a variety of simulated
data sets.
