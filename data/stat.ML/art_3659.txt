Predicting online user behaviour using deep learning algorithms
We propose a robust classifier to predict buying intentions based on user
behaviour within a large e-commerce website. In this work we compare
traditional machine learning techniques with the most advanced deep learning
approaches. We show that both Deep Belief Networks and Stacked Denoising
auto-Encoders achieved a substantial improvement by extracting features from
high dimensional data during the pre-train phase. They prove also to be more
convenient to deal with severe class imbalance.
