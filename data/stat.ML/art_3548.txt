High-dimensional Time Series Prediction with Missing Values
High-dimensional time series prediction is needed in applications as diverse
as demand forecasting and climatology. Often, such applications require methods
that are both highly scalable, and deal with noisy data in terms of corruptions
or missing values. Classical time series methods usually fall short of handling
both these issues. In this paper, we propose to adapt matrix matrix completion
approaches that have previously been successfully applied to large scale noisy
data, but which fail to adequately model high-dimensional time series due to
temporal dependencies. We present a novel temporal regularized matrix
factorization (TRMF) framework which supports data-driven temporal dependency
learning and enables forecasting ability to our new matrix factorization
approach. TRMF is highly general, and subsumes many existing matrix
factorization approaches for time series data. We make interesting connections
to graph regularized matrix factorization methods in the context of learning
the dependencies. Experiments on both real and synthetic data show that TRMF
outperforms several existing approaches for common time series tasks.
