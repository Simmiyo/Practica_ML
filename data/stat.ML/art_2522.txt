Logistic Tensor Factorization for Multi-Relational Data
Tensor factorizations have become increasingly popular approaches for various
learning tasks on structured data. In this work, we extend the RESCAL tensor
factorization, which has shown state-of-the-art results for multi-relational
learning, to account for the binary nature of adjacency tensors. We study the
improvements that can be gained via this approach on various benchmark datasets
and show that the logistic extension can improve the prediction results
significantly.
