Asymptotic Behavior of Mean Partitions in Consensus Clustering
Although consistency is a minimum requirement of any estimator, little is
known about consistency of the mean partition approach in consensus clustering.
This contribution studies the asymptotic behavior of mean partitions. We show
that under normal assumptions, the mean partition approach is consistent and
asymptotic normal. To derive both results, we represent partitions as points of
some geometric space, called orbit space. Then we draw on results from the
theory of Fr\'echet means and stochastic programming. The asymptotic properties
hold for continuous extensions of standard cluster criteria (indices). The
results justify consensus clustering using finite but sufficiently large sample
sizes. Furthermore, the orbit space framework provides a mathematical
foundation for studying further statistical, geometrical, and analytical
properties of sets of partitions.
