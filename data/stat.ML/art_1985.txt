Correlated Non-Parametric Latent Feature Models
We are often interested in explaining data through a set of hidden factors or
features. When the number of hidden features is unknown, the Indian Buffet
Process (IBP) is a nonparametric latent feature model that does not bound the
number of active features in dataset. However, the IBP assumes that all latent
features are uncorrelated, making it inadequate for many realworld problems. We
introduce a framework for correlated nonparametric feature models, generalising
the IBP. We use this framework to generate several specific models and
demonstrate applications on realworld datasets.
