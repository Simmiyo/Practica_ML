Semi-Supervised Active Learning for Support Vector Machines: A Novel
  Approach that Exploits Structure Information in Data
In our today's information society more and more data emerges, e.g.~in social
networks, technical applications, or business applications. Companies try to
commercialize these data using data mining or machine learning methods. For
this purpose, the data are categorized or classified, but often at high
(monetary or temporal) costs. An effective approach to reduce these costs is to
apply any kind of active learning (AL) methods, as AL controls the training
process of a classifier by specific querying individual data points (samples),
which are then labeled (e.g., provided with class memberships) by a domain
expert. However, an analysis of current AL research shows that AL still has
some shortcomings. In particular, the structure information given by the
spatial pattern of the (un)labeled data in the input space of a classification
model (e.g.,~cluster information), is used in an insufficient way. In addition,
many existing AL techniques pay too little attention to their practical
applicability. To meet these challenges, this article presents several
techniques that together build a new approach for combining AL and
semi-supervised learning (SSL) for support vector machines (SVM) in
classification tasks. Structure information is captured by means of
probabilistic models that are iteratively improved at runtime when label
information becomes available. The probabilistic models are considered in a
selection strategy based on distance, density, diversity, and distribution (4DS
strategy) information for AL and in a kernel function (Responsibility Weighted
Mahalanobis kernel) for SVM. The approach fuses generative and discriminative
modeling techniques. With 20 benchmark data sets and with the MNIST data set it
is shown that our new solution yields significantly better results than
state-of-the-art methods.
