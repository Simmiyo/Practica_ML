Efficient Latent Variable Graphical Model Selection via Split Bregman
  Method
We consider the problem of covariance matrix estimation in the presence of
latent variables. Under suitable conditions, it is possible to learn the
marginal covariance matrix of the observed variables via a tractable convex
program, where the concentration matrix of the observed variables is decomposed
into a sparse matrix (representing the graphical structure of the observed
variables) and a low rank matrix (representing the marginalization effect of
latent variables). We present an efficient first-order method based on split
Bregman to solve the convex problem. The algorithm is guaranteed to converge
under mild conditions. We show that our algorithm is significantly faster than
the state-of-the-art algorithm on both artificial and real-world data. Applying
the algorithm to a gene expression data involving thousands of genes, we show
that most of the correlation between observed variables can be explained by
only a few dozen latent factors.
