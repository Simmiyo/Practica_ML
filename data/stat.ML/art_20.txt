Local Procrustes for Manifold Embedding: A Measure of Embedding Quality
  and Embedding Algorithms
We present the Procrustes measure, a novel measure based on Procrustes
rotation that enables quantitative comparison of the output of manifold-based
embedding algorithms (such as LLE (Roweis and Saul, 2000) and Isomap (Tenenbaum
et al, 2000)). The measure also serves as a natural tool when choosing
dimension-reduction parameters. We also present two novel dimension-reduction
techniques that attempt to minimize the suggested measure, and compare the
results of these techniques to the results of existing algorithms. Finally, we
suggest a simple iterative method that can be used to improve the output of
existing algorithms.
