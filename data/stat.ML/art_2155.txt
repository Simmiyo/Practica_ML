Bayesian Random Fields: The Bethe-Laplace Approximation
While learning the maximum likelihood value of parameters of an undirected
graphical model is hard, modelling the posterior distribution over parameters
given data is harder. Yet, undirected models are ubiquitous in computer vision
and text modelling (e.g. conditional random fields). But where Bayesian
approaches for directed models have been very successful, a proper Bayesian
treatment of undirected models in still in its infant stages. We propose a new
method for approximating the posterior of the parameters given data based on
the Laplace approximation. This approximation requires the computation of the
covariance matrix over features which we compute using the linear response
approximation based in turn on loopy belief propagation. We develop the theory
for conditional and 'unconditional' random fields with or without hidden
variables. In the conditional setting we introduce a new variant of bagging
suitable for structured domains. Here we run the loopy max-product algorithm on
a 'super-graph' composed of graphs for individual models sampled from the
posterior and connected by constraints. Experiments on real world data validate
the proposed methods.
