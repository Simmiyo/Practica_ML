Clustering for high-dimension, low-sample size data using distance
  vectors
In high-dimension, low-sample size (HDLSS) data, it is not always true that
closeness of two objects reflects a hidden cluster structure. We point out the
important fact that it is not the closeness, but the "values" of distance that
contain information of the cluster structure in high-dimensional space. Based
on this fact, we propose an efficient and simple clustering approach, called
distance vector clustering, for HDLSS data. Under the assumptions given in the
work of Hall et al. (2005), we show the proposed approach provides a true
cluster label under milder conditions when the dimension tends to infinity with
the sample size fixed. The effectiveness of the distance vector clustering
approach is illustrated through a numerical experiment and real data analysis.
