Dissimilarity Clustering by Hierarchical Multi-Level Refinement
We introduce in this paper a new way of optimizing the natural extension of
the quantization error using in k-means clustering to dissimilarity data. The
proposed method is based on hierarchical clustering analysis combined with
multi-level heuristic refinement. The method is computationally efficient and
achieves better quantization errors than the
