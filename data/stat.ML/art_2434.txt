One-Class Support Measure Machines for Group Anomaly Detection
We propose one-class support measure machines (OCSMMs) for group anomaly
detection which aims at recognizing anomalous aggregate behaviors of data
points. The OCSMMs generalize well-known one-class support vector machines
(OCSVMs) to a space of probability measures. By formulating the problem as
quantile estimation on distributions, we can establish an interesting
connection to the OCSVMs and variable kernel density estimators (VKDEs) over
the input space on which the distributions are defined, bridging the gap
between large-margin methods and kernel density estimators. In particular, we
show that various types of VKDEs can be considered as solutions to a class of
regularization problems studied in this paper. Experiments on Sloan Digital Sky
Survey dataset and High Energy Particle Physics dataset demonstrate the
benefits of the proposed framework in real-world applications.
