Dictionary Learning from Incomplete Data
This paper extends the recently proposed and theoretically justified
iterative thresholding and $K$ residual means algorithm ITKrM to learning
dicionaries from incomplete/masked training data (ITKrMM). It further adapts
the algorithm to the presence of a low rank component in the data and provides
a strategy for recovering this low rank component again from incomplete data.
Several synthetic experiments show the advantages of incorporating information
about the corruption into the algorithm. Finally, image inpainting is
considered as application example, which demonstrates the superior performance
of ITKrMM in terms of speed at similar or better reconstruction quality
compared to its closest dictionary learning counterpart.
