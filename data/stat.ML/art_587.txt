Dense Distributions from Sparse Samples: Improved Gibbs Sampling
  Parameter Estimators for LDA
We introduce a novel approach for estimating Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA) parameters from collapsed Gibbs samples (CGS), by leveraging the full
conditional distributions over the latent variable assignments to efficiently
average over multiple samples, for little more computational cost than drawing
a single additional collapsed Gibbs sample. Our approach can be understood as
adapting the soft clustering methodology of Collapsed Variational Bayes (CVB0)
to CGS parameter estimation, in order to get the best of both techniques. Our
estimators can straightforwardly be applied to the output of any existing
implementation of CGS, including modern accelerated variants. We perform
extensive empirical comparisons of our estimators with those of standard
collapsed inference algorithms on real-world data for both unsupervised LDA and
Prior-LDA, a supervised variant of LDA for multi-label classification. Our
results show a consistent advantage of our approach over traditional CGS under
all experimental conditions, and over CVB0 inference in the majority of
conditions. More broadly, our results highlight the importance of averaging
over multiple samples in LDA parameter estimation, and the use of efficient
computational techniques to do so.
