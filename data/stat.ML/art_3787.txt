Package equivalence in complex software network
The public package registry npm is one of the biggest software registry. With
its 216 911 software packages, it forms a big network of software dependencies.
In this paper we evaluate various methods for finding similar packages in the
npm network, using only the structure of the graph. Namely, we want to find a
way of categorizing similar packages, which would be useful for recommendation
systems. This size enables us to compute meaningful results, as it softened the
particularities of the graph. Npm is also quite famous as it is the default
package repository of Node.js. We believe that it will make our results
interesting for more people than a less used package repository. This makes it
a good subject of analysis of software networks.
