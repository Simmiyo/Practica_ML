Random Maxout Features
In this paper, we propose and study random maxout features, which are
constructed by first projecting the input data onto sets of randomly generated
vectors with Gaussian elements, and then outputing the maximum projection value
for each set. We show that the resulting random feature map, when used in
conjunction with linear models, allows for the locally linear estimation of the
function of interest in classification tasks, and for the locally linear
embedding of points when used for dimensionality reduction or data
visualization. We derive generalization bounds for learning that assess the
error in approximating locally linear functions by linear functions in the
maxout feature space, and empirically evaluate the efficacy of the approach on
the MNIST and TIMIT classification tasks.
