Generalized K-fan Multimodal Deep Model with Shared Representations
Multimodal learning with deep Boltzmann machines (DBMs) is an generative
approach to fuse multimodal inputs, and can learn the shared representation via
Contrastive Divergence (CD) for classification and information retrieval tasks.
However, it is a 2-fan DBM model, and cannot effectively handle multiple
prediction tasks. Moreover, this model cannot recover the hidden
representations well by sampling from the conditional distribution when more
than one modalities are missing. In this paper, we propose a K-fan deep
structure model, which can handle the multi-input and muti-output learning
problems effectively. In particular, the deep structure has K-branch for
different inputs where each branch can be composed of a multi-layer deep model,
and a shared representation is learned in an discriminative manner to tackle
multimodal tasks. Given the deep structure, we propose two objective functions
to handle two multi-input and multi-output tasks: joint visual restoration and
labeling, and the multi-view multi-calss object recognition tasks. To estimate
the model parameters, we initialize the deep model parameters with CD to
maximize the joint distribution, and then we use backpropagation to update the
model according to specific objective function. The experimental results
demonstrate that the model can effectively leverages multi-source information
and predict multiple tasks well over competitive baselines.
