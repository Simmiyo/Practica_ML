Source Separation and Clustering of Phase-Locked Subspaces: Derivations
  and Proofs
Due to space limitations, our submission "Source Separation and Clustering of
Phase-Locked Subspaces", accepted for publication on the IEEE Transactions on
Neural Networks in 2011, presented some results without proof. Those proofs are
provided in this paper.
