A Spectral Algorithm for Inference in Hidden Semi-Markov Models
Hidden semi-Markov models (HSMMs) are latent variable models which allow
latent state persistence and can be viewed as a generalization of the popular
hidden Markov models (HMMs). In this paper, we introduce a novel spectral
algorithm to perform inference in HSMMs. Unlike expectation maximization (EM),
our approach correctly estimates the probability of given observation sequence
based on a set of training sequences. Our approach is based on estimating
moments from the sample, whose number of dimensions depends only
logarithmically on the maximum length of the hidden state persistence.
Moreover, the algorithm requires only a few matrix inversions and is therefore
computationally efficient. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real data
demonstrate the advantage of the algorithm over EM in terms of speed and
accuracy, especially for large datasets.
