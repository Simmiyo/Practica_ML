A Survey of Online Experiment Design with the Stochastic Multi-Armed
  Bandit
Adaptive and sequential experiment design is a well-studied area in numerous
domains. We survey and synthesize the work of the online statistical learning
paradigm referred to as multi-armed bandits integrating the existing research
as a resource for a certain class of online experiments. We first explore the
traditional stochastic model of a multi-armed bandit, then explore a taxonomic
scheme of complications to that model, for each complication relating it to a
specific requirement or consideration of the experiment design context.
Finally, at the end of the paper, we present a table of known upper-bounds of
regret for all studied algorithms providing both perspectives for future
theoretical work and a decision-making tool for practitioners looking for
theoretical guarantees.
