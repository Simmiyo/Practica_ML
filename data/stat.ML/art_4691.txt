Stochastic Patching Process
Stochastic partition models tailor a product space into a number of
rectangular regions such that the data within each region exhibit certain types
of homogeneity. Due to constraints of partition strategy, existing models may
cause unnecessary dissections in sparse regions when fitting data in dense
regions. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a parsimonious partition
model, named Stochastic Patching Process (SPP), to deal with multi-dimensional
arrays. SPP adopts an "enclosing" strategy to attach rectangular patches to
dense regions. SPP is self-consistent such that it can be extended to infinite
arrays. We apply SPP to relational modeling and the experimental results
validate its merit compared to the state-of-the-arts.
