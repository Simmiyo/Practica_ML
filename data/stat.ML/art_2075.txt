Shift-Invariance Sparse Coding for Audio Classification
Sparse coding is an unsupervised learning algorithm that learns a succinct
high-level representation of the inputs given only unlabeled data; it
represents each input as a sparse linear combination of a set of basis
functions. Originally applied to modeling the human visual cortex, sparse
coding has also been shown to be useful for self-taught learning, in which the
goal is to solve a supervised classification task given access to additional
unlabeled data drawn from different classes than that in the supervised
learning problem. Shift-invariant sparse coding (SISC) is an extension of
sparse coding which reconstructs a (usually time-series) input using all of the
basis functions in all possible shifts. In this paper, we present an efficient
algorithm for learning SISC bases. Our method is based on iteratively solving
two large convex optimization problems: The first, which computes the linear
coefficients, is an L1-regularized linear least squares problem with
potentially hundreds of thousands of variables. Existing methods typically use
a heuristic to select a small subset of the variables to optimize, but we
present a way to efficiently compute the exact solution. The second, which
solves for bases, is a constrained linear least squares problem. By optimizing
over complex-valued variables in the Fourier domain, we reduce the coupling
between the different variables, allowing the problem to be solved efficiently.
We show that SISC's learned high-level representations of speech and music
provide useful features for classification tasks within those domains. When
applied to classification, under certain conditions the learned features
outperform state of the art spectral and cepstral features.
