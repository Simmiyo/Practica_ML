Feedback Message Passing for Inference in Gaussian Graphical Models
While loopy belief propagation (LBP) performs reasonably well for inference
in some Gaussian graphical models with cycles, its performance is
unsatisfactory for many others. In particular for some models LBP does not
converge, and in general when it does converge, the computed variances are
incorrect (except for cycle-free graphs for which belief propagation (BP) is
non-iterative and exact). In this paper we propose {\em feedback message
passing} (FMP), a message-passing algorithm that makes use of a special set of
vertices (called a {\em feedback vertex set} or {\em FVS}) whose removal
results in a cycle-free graph. In FMP, standard BP is employed several times on
the cycle-free subgraph excluding the FVS while a special message-passing
scheme is used for the nodes in the FVS. The computational complexity of exact
inference is $O(k^2n)$, where $k$ is the number of feedback nodes, and $n$ is
the total number of nodes. When the size of the FVS is very large, FMP is
intractable. Hence we propose {\em approximate FMP}, where a pseudo-FVS is used
instead of an FVS, and where inference in the non-cycle-free graph obtained by
removing the pseudo-FVS is carried out approximately using LBP. We show that,
when approximate FMP converges, it yields exact means and variances on the
pseudo-FVS and exact means throughout the remainder of the graph. We also
provide theoretical results on the convergence and accuracy of approximate FMP.
In particular, we prove error bounds on variance computation. Based on these
theoretical results, we design efficient algorithms to select a pseudo-FVS of
bounded size. The choice of the pseudo-FVS allows us to explicitly trade off
between efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results show that using a
pseudo-FVS of size no larger than $\log(n)$, this procedure converges much more
often, more quickly, and provides more accurate results than LBP on the entire
graph.
