Deepr: A Convolutional Net for Medical Records
Feature engineering remains a major bottleneck when creating predictive
systems from electronic medical records. At present, an important missing
element is detecting predictive regular clinical motifs from irregular episodic
records. We present Deepr (short for Deep record), a new end-to-end deep
learning system that learns to extract features from medical records and
predicts future risk automatically. Deepr transforms a record into a sequence
of discrete elements separated by coded time gaps and hospital transfers. On
top of the sequence is a convolutional neural net that detects and combines
predictive local clinical motifs to stratify the risk. Deepr permits
transparent inspection and visualization of its inner working. We validate
Deepr on hospital data to predict unplanned readmission after discharge. Deepr
achieves superior accuracy compared to traditional techniques, detects
meaningful clinical motifs, and uncovers the underlying structure of the
disease and intervention space.
