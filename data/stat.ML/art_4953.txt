Network Volume Anomaly Detection and Identification in Large-scale
  Networks based on Online Time-structured Traffic Tensor Tracking
This paper addresses network anomography, that is, the problem of inferring
network-level anomalies from indirect link measurements. This problem is cast
as a low-rank subspace tracking problem for normal flows under incomplete
observations, and an outlier detection problem for abnormal flows. Since
traffic data is large-scale time-structured data accompanied with noise and
outliers under partial observations, an efficient modeling method is essential.
To this end, this paper proposes an online subspace tracking of a Hankelized
time-structured traffic tensor for normal flows based on the Candecomp/PARAFAC
decomposition exploiting the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm. We
estimate abnormal flows as outlier sparse flows via sparsity maximization in
the underlying under-constrained linear-inverse problem. A major advantage is
that our algorithm estimates normal flows by low-dimensional matrices with
time-directional features as well as the spatial correlation of multiple links
without using the past observed measurements and the past model parameters.
Extensive numerical evaluations show that the proposed algorithm achieves
faster convergence per iteration of model approximation, and better volume
anomaly detection performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.
