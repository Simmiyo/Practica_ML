The Sum-over-Forests density index: identifying dense regions in a graph
This work introduces a novel nonparametric density index defined on graphs,
the Sum-over-Forests (SoF) density index. It is based on a clear and intuitive
idea: high-density regions in a graph are characterized by the fact that they
contain a large amount of low-cost trees with high outdegrees while low-density
regions contain few ones. Therefore, a Boltzmann probability distribution on
the countable set of forests in the graph is defined so that large (high-cost)
forests occur with a low probability while short (low-cost) forests occur with
a high probability. Then, the SoF density index of a node is defined as the
expected outdegree of this node in a non-trivial tree of the forest, thus
providing a measure of density around that node. Following the matrix-forest
theorem, and a statistical physics framework, it is shown that the SoF density
index can be easily computed in closed form through a simple matrix inversion.
Experiments on artificial and real data sets show that the proposed index
performs well on finding dense regions, for graphs of various origins.
