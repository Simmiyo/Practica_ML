K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm coupled with logistic regression in
  medical case-based reasoning systems. Application to prediction of access to
  the renal transplant waiting list in Brittany
Introduction. Case Based Reasoning (CBR) is an emerg- ing decision making
paradigm in medical research where new cases are solved relying on previously
solved similar cases. Usually, a database of solved cases is provided, and
every case is described through a set of attributes (inputs) and a label
(output). Extracting useful information from this database can help the CBR
system providing more reliable results on the yet to be solved cases.
Objective. For that purpose we suggest a general frame- work where a CBR
system, viz. K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) algorithm, is combined with various
information obtained from a Logistic Regression (LR) model. Methods. LR is
applied, on the case database, to assign weights to the attributes as well as
the solved cases. Thus, five possible decision making systems based on K-NN
and/or LR were identified: a standalone K-NN, a standalone LR and three soft
K-NN algorithms that rely on the weights based on the results of the LR. The
evaluation of the described approaches is performed in the field of renal
transplant access waiting list. Results and conclusion. The results show that
our suggested approach, where the K-NN algorithm relies on both weighted
attributes and cases, can efficiently deal with non relevant attributes,
whereas the four other approaches suffer from this kind of noisy setups. The
robustness of this approach suggests interesting perspectives for medical
problem solving tools using CBR methodology.
