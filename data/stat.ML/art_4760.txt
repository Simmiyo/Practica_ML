Sketching for Large-Scale Learning of Mixture Models
Learning parameters from voluminous data can be prohibitive in terms of
memory and computational requirements. We propose a "compressive learning"
framework where we estimate model parameters from a sketch of the training
data. This sketch is a collection of generalized moments of the underlying
probability distribution of the data. It can be computed in a single pass on
the training set, and is easily computable on streams or distributed datasets.
The proposed framework shares similarities with compressive sensing, which aims
at drastically reducing the dimension of high-dimensional signals while
preserving the ability to reconstruct them. To perform the estimation task, we
derive an iterative algorithm analogous to sparse reconstruction algorithms in
the context of linear inverse problems. We exemplify our framework with the
compressive estimation of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), providing heuristics
on the choice of the sketching procedure and theoretical guarantees of
reconstruction. We experimentally show on synthetic data that the proposed
algorithm yields results comparable to the classical Expectation-Maximization
(EM) technique while requiring significantly less memory and fewer computations
when the number of database elements is large. We further demonstrate the
potential of the approach on real large-scale data (over 10 8 training samples)
for the task of model-based speaker verification. Finally, we draw some
connections between the proposed framework and approximate Hilbert space
embedding of probability distributions using random features. We show that the
proposed sketching operator can be seen as an innovative method to design
translation-invariant kernels adapted to the analysis of GMMs. We also use this
theoretical framework to derive information preservation guarantees, in the
spirit of infinite-dimensional compressive sensing.
