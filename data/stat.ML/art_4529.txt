Sublinear Partition Estimation
The output scores of a neural network classifier are converted to
probabilities via normalizing over the scores of all competing categories.
Computing this partition function, $Z$, is then linear in the number of
categories, which is problematic as real-world problem sets continue to grow in
categorical types, such as in visual object recognition or discriminative
language modeling. We propose three approaches for sublinear estimation of the
partition function, based on approximate nearest neighbor search and kernel
feature maps and compare the performance of the proposed approaches
empirically.
