A Hierarchical Spectral Method for Extreme Classification
Extreme classification problems are multiclass and multilabel classification
problems where the number of outputs is so large that straightforward
strategies are neither statistically nor computationally viable. One strategy
for dealing with the computational burden is via a tree decomposition of the
output space. While this typically leads to training and inference that scales
sublinearly with the number of outputs, it also results in reduced statistical
performance. In this work, we identify two shortcomings of tree decomposition
methods, and describe two heuristic mitigations. We compose these with an
eigenvalue technique for constructing the tree. The end result is a
computationally efficient algorithm that provides good statistical performance
on several extreme data sets.
