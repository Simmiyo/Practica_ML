Unsupervised Active Learning in Large Domains
Active learning is a powerful approach to analyzing data effectively. We show
that the feasibility of active learning depends crucially on the choice of
measure with respect to which the query is being optimized. The standard
information gain, for example, does not permit an accurate evaluation with a
small committee, a representative subset of the model space. We propose a
surrogate measure requiring only a small committee and discuss the properties
of this new measure. We devise, in addition, a bootstrap approach for committee
selection. The advantages of this approach are illustrated in the context of
recovering (regulatory) network models.
