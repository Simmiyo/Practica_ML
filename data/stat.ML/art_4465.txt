Incorporating Side Information in Probabilistic Matrix Factorization
  with Gaussian Processes
Probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) is a powerful method for modeling
data associated with pairwise relationships, finding use in collaborative
filtering, computational biology, and document analysis, among other areas. In
many domains, there is additional information that can assist in prediction.
For example, when modeling movie ratings, we might know when the rating
occurred, where the user lives, or what actors appear in the movie. It is
difficult, however, to incorporate this side information into the PMF model. We
propose a framework for incorporating side information by coupling together
multiple PMF problems via Gaussian process priors. We replace scalar latent
features with functions that vary over the space of side information. The GP
priors on these functions require them to vary smoothly and share information.
We successfully use this new method to predict the scores of professional
basketball games, where side information about the venue and date of the game
are relevant for the outcome.
