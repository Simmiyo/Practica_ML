Rare Disease Physician Targeting: A Factor Graph Approach
In rare disease physician targeting, a major challenge is how to identify
physicians who are treating diagnosed or underdiagnosed rare diseases patients.
Rare diseases have extremely low incidence rate. For a specified rare disease,
only a small number of patients are affected and a fractional of physicians are
involved. The existing targeting methodologies, such as segmentation and
profiling, are developed under mass market assumption. They are not suitable
for rare disease market where the target classes are extremely imbalanced. The
authors propose a graphical model approach to predict targets by jointly
modeling physician and patient features from different data spaces and
utilizing the extra relational information. Through an empirical example with
medical claim and prescription data, the proposed approach demonstrates better
accuracy in finding target physicians. The graph representation also provides
visual interpretability of relationship among physicians and patients. The
model can be extended to incorporate more complex dependency structures. This
article contributes to the literature of exploring the benefit of utilizing
relational dependencies among entities in healthcare industry.
