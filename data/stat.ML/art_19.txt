Manifold Learning: The Price of Normalization
We analyze the performance of a class of manifold-learning algorithms that
find their output by minimizing a quadratic form under some normalization
constraints. This class consists of Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), Laplacian
Eigenmap, Local Tangent Space Alignment (LTSA), Hessian Eigenmaps (HLLE), and
Diffusion maps. We present and prove conditions on the manifold that are
necessary for the success of the algorithms. Both the finite sample case and
the limit case are analyzed. We show that there are simple manifolds in which
the necessary conditions are violated, and hence the algorithms cannot recover
the underlying manifolds. Finally, we present numerical results that
demonstrate our claims.
