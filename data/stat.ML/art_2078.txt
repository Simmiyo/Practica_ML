Apprenticeship Learning using Inverse Reinforcement Learning and
  Gradient Methods
In this paper we propose a novel gradient algorithm to learn a policy from an
expert's observed behavior assuming that the expert behaves optimally with
respect to some unknown reward function of a Markovian Decision Problem. The
algorithm's aim is to find a reward function such that the resulting optimal
policy matches well the expert's observed behavior. The main difficulty is that
the mapping from the parameters to policies is both nonsmooth and highly
redundant. Resorting to subdifferentials solves the first difficulty, while the
second one is over- come by computing natural gradients. We tested the proposed
method in two artificial domains and found it to be more reliable and efficient
than some previous methods.
