Negative Tree Reweighted Belief Propagation
We introduce a new class of lower bounds on the log partition function of a
Markov random field which makes use of a reversed Jensen's inequality. In
particular, our method approximates the intractable distribution using a linear
combination of spanning trees with negative weights. This technique is a
lower-bound counterpart to the tree-reweighted belief propagation algorithm,
which uses a convex combination of spanning trees with positive weights to
provide corresponding upper bounds. We develop algorithms to optimize and
tighten the lower bounds over the non-convex set of valid parameter values. Our
algorithm generalizes mean field approaches (including naive and structured
mean field approximations), which it includes as a limiting case.
