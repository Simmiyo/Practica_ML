Automatic Variational Inference in Stan
Variational inference is a scalable technique for approximate Bayesian
inference. Deriving variational inference algorithms requires tedious
model-specific calculations; this makes it difficult to automate. We propose an
automatic variational inference algorithm, automatic differentiation
variational inference (ADVI). The user only provides a Bayesian model and a
dataset; nothing else. We make no conjugacy assumptions and support a broad
class of models. The algorithm automatically determines an appropriate
variational family and optimizes the variational objective. We implement ADVI
in Stan (code available now), a probabilistic programming framework. We compare
ADVI to MCMC sampling across hierarchical generalized linear models,
nonconjugate matrix factorization, and a mixture model. We train the mixture
model on a quarter million images. With ADVI we can use variational inference
on any model we write in Stan.
