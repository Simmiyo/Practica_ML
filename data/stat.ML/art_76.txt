Composite Binary Losses
We study losses for binary classification and class probability estimation
and extend the understanding of them from margin losses to general composite
losses which are the composition of a proper loss with a link function. We
characterise when margin losses can be proper composite losses, explicitly show
how to determine a symmetric loss in full from half of one of its partial
losses, introduce an intrinsic parametrisation of composite binary losses and
give a complete characterisation of the relationship between proper losses and
``classification calibrated'' losses. We also consider the question of the
``best'' surrogate binary loss. We introduce a precise notion of ``best'' and
show there exist situations where two convex surrogate losses are
incommensurable. We provide a complete explicit characterisation of the
convexity of composite binary losses in terms of the link function and the
weight function associated with the proper loss which make up the composite
loss. This characterisation suggests new ways of ``surrogate tuning''. Finally,
in an appendix we present some new algorithm-independent results on the
relationship between properness, convexity and robustness to misclassification
noise for binary losses and show that all convex proper losses are non-robust
to misclassification noise.
