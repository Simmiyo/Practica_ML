Estimating Densities with Non-Parametric Exponential Families
We propose a novel approach for density estimation with exponential families
for the case when the true density may not fall within the chosen family. Our
approach augments the sufficient statistics with features designed to
accumulate probability mass in the neighborhood of the observed points,
resulting in a non-parametric model similar to kernel density estimators. We
show that under mild conditions, the resulting model uses only the sufficient
statistics if the density is within the chosen exponential family, and
asymptotically, it approximates densities outside of the chosen exponential
family. Using the proposed approach, we modify the exponential random graph
model, commonly used for modeling small-size graph distributions, to address
the well-known issue of model degeneracy.
