BRAINSTORMING: Consensus Learning in Practice
We present here an introduction to Brainstorming approach, that was recently
proposed as a consensus meta-learning technique, and used in several practical
applications in bioinformatics and chemoinformatics. The consensus learning
denotes heterogeneous theoretical classification method, where one trains an
ensemble of machine learning algorithms using different types of input training
data representations. In the second step all solutions are gathered and the
consensus is build between them. Therefore no early solution, given even by a
generally low performing algorithm, is not discarder until the late phase of
prediction, when the final conclusion is drawn by comparing different machine
learning models. This final phase, i.e. consensus learning, is trying to
balance the generality of solution and the overall performance of trained
model.
