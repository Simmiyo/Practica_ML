A Graph-Based Semi-Supervised k Nearest-Neighbor Method for Nonlinear
  Manifold Distributed Data Classification
$k$ Nearest Neighbors ($k$NN) is one of the most widely used supervised
learning algorithms to classify Gaussian distributed data, but it does not
achieve good results when it is applied to nonlinear manifold distributed data,
especially when a very limited amount of labeled samples are available. In this
paper, we propose a new graph-based $k$NN algorithm which can effectively
handle both Gaussian distributed data and nonlinear manifold distributed data.
To achieve this goal, we first propose a constrained Tired Random Walk (TRW) by
constructing an $R$-level nearest-neighbor strengthened tree over the graph,
and then compute a TRW matrix for similarity measurement purposes. After this,
the nearest neighbors are identified according to the TRW matrix and the class
label of a query point is determined by the sum of all the TRW weights of its
nearest neighbors. To deal with online situations, we also propose a new
algorithm to handle sequential samples based a local neighborhood
reconstruction. Comparison experiments are conducted on both synthetic data
sets and real-world data sets to demonstrate the validity of the proposed new
$k$NN algorithm and its improvements to other version of $k$NN algorithms.
Given the widespread appearance of manifold structures in real-world problems
and the popularity of the traditional $k$NN algorithm, the proposed manifold
version $k$NN shows promising potential for classifying manifold-distributed
data.
