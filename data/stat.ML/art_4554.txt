Feature Selection via Binary Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic
  Approximation
Feature selection (FS) has become an indispensable task in dealing with
today's highly complex pattern recognition problems with massive number of
features. In this study, we propose a new wrapper approach for FS based on
binary simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (BSPSA). This
pseudo-gradient descent stochastic algorithm starts with an initial feature
vector and moves toward the optimal feature vector via successive iterations.
In each iteration, the current feature vector's individual components are
perturbed simultaneously by random offsets from a qualified probability
distribution. We present computational experiments on datasets with numbers of
features ranging from a few dozens to thousands using three widely-used
classifiers as wrappers: nearest neighbor, decision tree, and linear support
vector machine. We compare our methodology against the full set of features as
well as a binary genetic algorithm and sequential FS methods using
cross-validated classification error rate and AUC as the performance criteria.
Our results indicate that features selected by BSPSA compare favorably to
alternative methods in general and BSPSA can yield superior feature sets for
datasets with tens of thousands of features by examining an extremely small
fraction of the solution space. We are not aware of any other wrapper FS
methods that are computationally feasible with good convergence properties for
such large datasets.
