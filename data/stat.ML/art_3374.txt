Belief Flows of Robust Online Learning
This paper introduces a new probabilistic model for online learning which
dynamically incorporates information from stochastic gradients of an arbitrary
loss function. Similar to probabilistic filtering, the model maintains a
Gaussian belief over the optimal weight parameters. Unlike traditional Bayesian
updates, the model incorporates a small number of gradient evaluations at
locations chosen using Thompson sampling, making it computationally tractable.
The belief is then transformed via a linear flow field which optimally updates
the belief distribution using rules derived from information theoretic
principles. Several versions of the algorithm are shown using different
constraints on the flow field and compared with conventional online learning
algorithms. Results are given for several classification tasks including
logistic regression and multilayer neural networks.
