Machine Learning meets Data-Driven Journalism: Boosting International
  Understanding and Transparency in News Coverage
Migration crisis, climate change or tax havens: Global challenges need global
solutions. But agreeing on a joint approach is difficult without a common
ground for discussion. Public spheres are highly segmented because news are
mainly produced and received on a national level. Gain- ing a global view on
international debates about important issues is hindered by the enormous
quantity of news and by language barriers. Media analysis usually focuses only
on qualitative re- search. In this position statement, we argue that it is
imperative to pool methods from machine learning, journalism studies and
statistics to help bridging the segmented data of the international public
sphere, using the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) as a
case study.
