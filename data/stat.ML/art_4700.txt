Kernel-based Reconstruction of Graph Signals
A number of applications in engineering, social sciences, physics, and
biology involve inference over networks. In this context, graph signals are
widely encountered as descriptors of vertex attributes or features in
graph-structured data. Estimating such signals in all vertices given noisy
observations of their values on a subset of vertices has been extensively
analyzed in the literature of signal processing on graphs (SPoG). This paper
advocates kernel regression as a framework generalizing popular SPoG modeling
and reconstruction and expanding their capabilities. Formulating signal
reconstruction as a regression task on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of
graph signals permeates benefits from statistical learning, offers fresh
insights, and allows for estimators to leverage richer forms of prior
information than existing alternatives. A number of SPoG notions such as
bandlimitedness, graph filters, and the graph Fourier transform are naturally
accommodated in the kernel framework. Additionally, this paper capitalizes on
the so-called representer theorem to devise simpler versions of existing
Thikhonov regularized estimators, and offers a novel probabilistic
interpretation of kernel methods on graphs based on graphical models. Motivated
by the challenges of selecting the bandwidth parameter in SPoG estimators or
the kernel map in kernel-based methods, the present paper further proposes two
multi-kernel approaches with complementary strengths. Whereas the first enables
estimation of the unknown bandwidth of bandlimited signals, the second allows
for efficient graph filter selection. Numerical tests with synthetic as well as
real data demonstrate the merits of the proposed methods relative to
state-of-the-art alternatives.
