Optimal Weighting of Multi-View Data with Low Dimensional Hidden States
In Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, data often has the following two
properties: First, data can be chopped into multi-views which has been
successfully used for dimension reduction purposes. For example, in topic
classification, every paper can be chopped into the title, the main text and
the references. However, it is common that some of the views are less noisier
than other views for supervised learning problems. Second, unlabeled data are
easy to obtain while labeled data are relatively rare. For example, articles
occurred on New York Times in recent 10 years are easy to grab but having them
classified as 'Politics', 'Finance' or 'Sports' need human labor. Hence less
noisy features are preferred before running supervised learning methods. In
this paper we propose an unsupervised algorithm which optimally weights
features from different views when these views are generated from a low
dimensional hidden state, which occurs in widely used models like Mixture
Gaussian Model, Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA).
