Products of Hidden Markov Models: It Takes N>1 to Tango
Products of Hidden Markov Models(PoHMMs) are an interesting class of
generative models which have received little attention since their
introduction. This maybe in part due to their more computationally expensive
gradient-based learning algorithm,and the intractability of computing the log
likelihood of sequences under the model. In this paper, we demonstrate how the
partition function can be estimated reliably via Annealed Importance Sampling.
We perform experiments using contrastive divergence learning on rainfall data
and data captured from pairs of people dancing. Our results suggest that
advances in learning and evaluation for undirected graphical models and recent
increases in available computing power make PoHMMs worth considering for
complex time-series modeling tasks.
