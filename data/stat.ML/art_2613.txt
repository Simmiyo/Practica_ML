Convex Relaxations of Bregman Divergence Clustering
Although many convex relaxations of clustering have been proposed in the past
decade, current formulations remain restricted to spherical Gaussian or
discriminative models and are susceptible to imbalanced clusters. To address
these shortcomings, we propose a new class of convex relaxations that can be
flexibly applied to more general forms of Bregman divergence clustering. By
basing these new formulations on normalized equivalence relations we retain
additional control on relaxation quality, which allows improvement in
clustering quality. We furthermore develop optimization methods that improve
scalability by exploiting recent implicit matrix norm methods. In practice, we
find that the new formulations are able to efficiently produce tighter
clusterings that improve the accuracy of state of the art methods.
