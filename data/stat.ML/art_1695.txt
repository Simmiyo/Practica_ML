The Loss Rank Criterion for Variable Selection in Linear Regression
  Analysis
Lasso and other regularization procedures are attractive methods for variable
selection, subject to a proper choice of shrinkage parameter. Given a set of
potential subsets produced by a regularization algorithm, a consistent model
selection criterion is proposed to select the best one among this preselected
set. The approach leads to a fast and efficient procedure for variable
selection, especially in high-dimensional settings. Model selection consistency
of the suggested criterion is proven when the number of covariates d is fixed.
Simulation studies suggest that the criterion still enjoys model selection
consistency when d is much larger than the sample size. The simulations also
show that our approach for variable selection works surprisingly well in
comparison with existing competitors. The method is also applied to a real data
set.
