Dirichlet Process Mixtures of Generalized Linear Models
We propose Dirichlet Process mixtures of Generalized Linear Models (DP-GLM),
a new method of nonparametric regression that accommodates continuous and
categorical inputs, and responses that can be modeled by a generalized linear
model. We prove conditions for the asymptotic unbiasedness of the DP-GLM
regression mean function estimate. We also give examples for when those
conditions hold, including models for compactly supported continuous
distributions and a model with continuous covariates and categorical response.
We empirically analyze the properties of the DP-GLM and why it provides better
results than existing Dirichlet process mixture regression models. We evaluate
DP-GLM on several data sets, comparing it to modern methods of nonparametric
regression like CART, Bayesian trees and Gaussian processes. Compared to
existing techniques, the DP-GLM provides a single model (and corresponding
inference algorithms) that performs well in many regression settings.
