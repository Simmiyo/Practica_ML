Positive Definite Kernels in Machine Learning
This survey is an introduction to positive definite kernels and the set of
methods they have inspired in the machine learning literature, namely kernel
methods. We first discuss some properties of positive definite kernels as well
as reproducing kernel Hibert spaces, the natural extension of the set of
functions $\{k(x,\cdot),x\in\mathcal{X}\}$ associated with a kernel $k$ defined
on a space $\mathcal{X}$. We discuss at length the construction of kernel
functions that take advantage of well-known statistical models. We provide an
overview of numerous data-analysis methods which take advantage of reproducing
kernel Hilbert spaces and discuss the idea of combining several kernels to
improve the performance on certain tasks. We also provide a short cookbook of
different kernels which are particularly useful for certain data-types such as
images, graphs or speech segments.
