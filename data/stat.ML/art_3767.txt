The "Sprekend Nederland" project and its application to accent location
This paper describes the data collection effort that is part of the project
Sprekend Nederland (The Netherlands Talking), and discusses its potential use
in Automatic Accent Location. We define Automatic Accent Location as the task
to describe the accent of a speaker in terms of the location of the speaker and
its history. We discuss possible ways of describing accent location, the
consequence these have for the task of automatic accent location, and potential
evaluation metrics.
