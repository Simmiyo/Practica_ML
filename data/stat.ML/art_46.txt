The Feature Importance Ranking Measure
Most accurate predictions are typically obtained by learning machines with
complex feature spaces (as e.g. induced by kernels). Unfortunately, such
decision rules are hardly accessible to humans and cannot easily be used to
gain insights about the application domain. Therefore, one often resorts to
linear models in combination with variable selection, thereby sacrificing some
predictive power for presumptive interpretability. Here, we introduce the
Feature Importance Ranking Measure (FIRM), which by retrospective analysis of
arbitrary learning machines allows to achieve both excellent predictive
performance and superior interpretation. In contrast to standard raw feature
weighting, FIRM takes the underlying correlation structure of the features into
account. Thereby, it is able to discover the most relevant features, even if
their appearance in the training data is entirely prevented by noise. The
desirable properties of FIRM are investigated analytically and illustrated in
simulations.
