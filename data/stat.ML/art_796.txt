Exact Bayesian inference for off-line change-point detection in
  tree-structured graphical models
We consider the problem of change-point detection in multivariate
time-series. The multivariate distribution of the observations is supposed to
follow a graphical model, whose graph and parameters are affected by abrupt
changes throughout time. We demonstrate that it is possible to perform exact
Bayesian inference whenever one considers a simple class of undirected graphs
called spanning trees as possible structures. We are then able to integrate on
the graph and segmentation spaces at the same time by combining classical
dynamic programming with algebraic results pertaining to spanning trees. In
particular, we show that quantities such as posterior distributions for
change-points or posterior edge probabilities over time can efficiently be
obtained. We illustrate our results on both synthetic and experimental data
arising from biology and neuroscience.
