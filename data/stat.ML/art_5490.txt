Learning Certifiably Optimal Rule Lists for Categorical Data
We present the design and implementation of a custom discrete optimization
technique for building rule lists over a categorical feature space. Our
algorithm produces rule lists with optimal training performance, according to
the regularized empirical risk, with a certificate of optimality. By leveraging
algorithmic bounds, efficient data structures, and computational reuse, we
achieve several orders of magnitude speedup in time and a massive reduction of
memory consumption. We demonstrate that our approach produces optimal rule
lists on practical problems in seconds. Our results indicate that it is
possible to construct optimal sparse rule lists that are approximately as
accurate as the COMPAS proprietary risk prediction tool on data from Broward
County, Florida, but that are completely interpretable. This framework is a
novel alternative to CART and other decision tree methods for interpretable
modeling.
