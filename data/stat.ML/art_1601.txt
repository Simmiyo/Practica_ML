Non-linear regression models for Approximate Bayesian Computation
Approximate Bayesian inference on the basis of summary statistics is
well-suited to complex problems for which the likelihood is either
mathematically or computationally intractable. However the methods that use
rejection suffer from the curse of dimensionality when the number of summary
statistics is increased. Here we propose a machine-learning approach to the
estimation of the posterior density by introducing two innovations. The new
method fits a nonlinear conditional heteroscedastic regression of the parameter
on the summary statistics, and then adaptively improves estimation using
importance sampling. The new algorithm is compared to the state-of-the-art
approximate Bayesian methods, and achieves considerable reduction of the
computational burden in two examples of inference in statistical genetics and
in a queueing model.
