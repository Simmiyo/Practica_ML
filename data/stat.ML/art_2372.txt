Combining Feature and Prototype Pruning by Uncertainty Minimization
We focus in this paper on dataset reduction techniques for use in k-nearest
neighbor classification. In such a context, feature and prototype selections
have always been independently treated by the standard storage reduction
algorithms. While this certifying is theoretically justified by the fact that
each subproblem is NP-hard, we assume in this paper that a joint storage
reduction is in fact more intuitive and can in practice provide better results
than two independent processes. Moreover, it avoids a lot of distance
calculations by progressively removing useless instances during the feature
pruning. While standard selection algorithms often optimize the accuracy to
discriminate the set of solutions, we use in this paper a criterion based on an
uncertainty measure within a nearest-neighbor graph. This choice comes from
recent results that have proven that accuracy is not always the suitable
criterion to optimize. In our approach, a feature or an instance is removed if
its deletion improves information of the graph. Numerous experiments are
presented in this paper and a statistical analysis shows the relevance of our
approach, and its tolerance in the presence of noise.
