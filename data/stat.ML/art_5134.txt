Robust Learning with Kernel Mean p-Power Error Loss
Correntropy is a second order statistical measure in kernel space, which has
been successfully applied in robust learning and signal processing. In this
paper, we define a nonsecond order statistical measure in kernel space, called
the kernel mean-p power error (KMPE), including the correntropic loss (CLoss)
as a special case. Some basic properties of KMPE are presented. In particular,
we apply the KMPE to extreme learning machine (ELM) and principal component
analysis (PCA), and develop two robust learning algorithms, namely ELM-KMPE and
PCA-KMPE. Experimental results on synthetic and benchmark data show that the
developed algorithms can achieve consistently better performance when compared
with some existing methods.
