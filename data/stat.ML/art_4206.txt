A Bayesian algorithm for detecting identity matches and fraud in image
  databases
A statistical algorithm for categorizing different types of matches and fraud
in image databases is presented. The approach is based on a generative model of
a graph representing images and connections between pairs of identities,
trained using properties of a matching algorithm between images.
