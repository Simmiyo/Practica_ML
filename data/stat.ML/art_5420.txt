Aggregation of Classifiers: A Justifiable Information Granularity
  Approach
In this study, we introduce a new approach to combine multi-classifiers in an
ensemble system. Instead of using numeric membership values encountered in
fixed combining rules, we construct interval membership values associated with
each class prediction at the level of meta-data of observation by using
concepts of information granules. In the proposed method, uncertainty
(diversity) of findings produced by the base classifiers is quantified by
interval-based information granules. The discriminative decision model is
generated by considering both the bounds and the length of the obtained
intervals. We select ten and then fifteen learning algorithms to build a
heterogeneous ensemble system and then conducted the experiment on a number of
UCI datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach
performs better than the benchmark algorithms including six fixed combining
methods, one trainable combining method, AdaBoost, Bagging, and Random
Subspace.
