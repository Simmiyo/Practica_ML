Mean-Field Theory of Meta-Learning
We discuss here the mean-field theory for a cellular automata model of
meta-learning. The meta-learning is the process of combining outcomes of
individual learning procedures in order to determine the final decision with
higher accuracy than any single learning method. Our method is constructed from
an ensemble of interacting, learning agents, that acquire and process incoming
information using various types, or different versions of machine learning
algorithms. The abstract learning space, where all agents are located, is
constructed here using a fully connected model that couples all agents with
random strength values. The cellular automata network simulates the higher
level integration of information acquired from the independent learning trials.
The final classification of incoming input data is therefore defined as the
stationary state of the meta-learning system using simple majority rule, yet
the minority clusters that share opposite classification outcome can be
observed in the system. Therefore, the probability of selecting proper class
for a given input data, can be estimated even without the prior knowledge of
its affiliation. The fuzzy logic can be easily introduced into the system, even
if learning agents are build from simple binary classification machine learning
algorithms by calculating the percentage of agreeing agents.
