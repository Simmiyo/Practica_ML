Cover Tree Bayesian Reinforcement Learning
This paper proposes an online tree-based Bayesian approach for reinforcement
learning. For inference, we employ a generalised context tree model. This
defines a distribution on multivariate Gaussian piecewise-linear models, which
can be updated in closed form. The tree structure itself is constructed using
the cover tree method, which remains efficient in high dimensional spaces. We
combine the model with Thompson sampling and approximate dynamic programming to
obtain effective exploration policies in unknown environments. The flexibility
and computational simplicity of the model render it suitable for many
reinforcement learning problems in continuous state spaces. We demonstrate this
in an experimental comparison with least squares policy iteration.
