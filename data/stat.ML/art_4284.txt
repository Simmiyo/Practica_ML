Deformable Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network in
  Microwave Based Hand Gesture Recognition System
Traditional vision-based hand gesture recognition systems is limited under
dark circumstances. In this paper, we build a hand gesture recognition system
based on microwave transceiver and deep learning algorithm. A Doppler radar
sensor with dual receiving channels at 5.8GHz is used to acquire a big database
of hand gestures signals. The received hand gesture signals are then processed
with time-frequency analysis. Based on these big databases of hand gesture, we
propose a new machine learning architecture called deformable deep
convolutional generative adversarial network. Experimental results show the new
architecture can upgrade the recognition rate by 10% and the deformable kernel
can reduce the testing time cost by 30%.
