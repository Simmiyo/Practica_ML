Semi-supervised logistic discrimination via labeled data and unlabeled
  data from different sampling distributions
This article addresses the problem of classification method based on both
labeled and unlabeled data, where we assume that a density function for labeled
data is different from that for unlabeled data. We propose a semi-supervised
logistic regression model for classification problem along with the technique
of covariate shift adaptation. Unknown parameters involved in proposed models
are estimated by regularization with EM algorithm. A crucial issue in the
modeling process is the choices of tuning parameters in our semi-supervised
logistic models. In order to select the parameters, a model selection criterion
is derived from an information-theoretic approach. Some numerical studies show
that our modeling procedure performs well in various cases.
