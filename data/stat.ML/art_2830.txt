A Proximal Stochastic Gradient Method with Progressive Variance
  Reduction
We consider the problem of minimizing the sum of two convex functions: one is
the average of a large number of smooth component functions, and the other is a
general convex function that admits a simple proximal mapping. We assume the
whole objective function is strongly convex. Such problems often arise in
machine learning, known as regularized empirical risk minimization. We propose
and analyze a new proximal stochastic gradient method, which uses a multi-stage
scheme to progressively reduce the variance of the stochastic gradient. While
each iteration of this algorithm has similar cost as the classical stochastic
gradient method (or incremental gradient method), we show that the expected
objective value converges to the optimum at a geometric rate. The overall
complexity of this method is much lower than both the proximal full gradient
method and the standard proximal stochastic gradient method.
