Mean-Field Networks
The mean field algorithm is a widely used approximate inference algorithm for
graphical models whose exact inference is intractable. In each iteration of
mean field, the approximate marginals for each variable are updated by getting
information from the neighbors. This process can be equivalently converted into
a feedforward network, with each layer representing one iteration of mean field
and with tied weights on all layers. This conversion enables a few natural
extensions, e.g. untying the weights in the network. In this paper, we study
these mean field networks (MFNs), and use them as inference tools as well as
discriminative models. Preliminary experiment results show that MFNs can learn
to do inference very efficiently and perform significantly better than mean
field as discriminative models.
