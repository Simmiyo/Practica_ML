On Iterative Hard Thresholding Methods for High-dimensional M-Estimation
The use of M-estimators in generalized linear regression models in high
dimensional settings requires risk minimization with hard $L_0$ constraints. Of
the known methods, the class of projected gradient descent (also known as
iterative hard thresholding (IHT)) methods is known to offer the fastest and
most scalable solutions. However, the current state-of-the-art is only able to
analyze these methods in extremely restrictive settings which do not hold in
high dimensional statistical models. In this work we bridge this gap by
providing the first analysis for IHT-style methods in the high dimensional
statistical setting. Our bounds are tight and match known minimax lower bounds.
Our results rely on a general analysis framework that enables us to analyze
several popular hard thresholding style algorithms (such as HTP, CoSaMP, SP) in
the high dimensional regression setting. We also extend our analysis to a large
family of "fully corrective methods" that includes two-stage and partial
hard-thresholding algorithms. We show that our results hold for the problem of
sparse regression, as well as low-rank matrix recovery.
