Sparse and low-rank multivariate Hawkes processes
We consider the problem of unveiling the implicit network structure of node
interactions (such as user interactions in a social network), based only on
high-frequency timestamps. Our inference is based on the minimization of the
least-squares loss associated with a multivariate Hawkes model, penalized by
$\ell_1$ and trace norm of the interaction tensor. We provide a first
theoretical analysis for this problem, that includes sparsity and low-rank
inducing penalizations. This result involves a new data-driven concentration
inequality for matrix martingales in continuous time with observable variance,
which is a result of independent interest. A consequence of our analysis is the
construction of sharply tuned $\ell_1$ and trace-norm penalizations, that leads
to a data-driven scaling of the variability of information available for each
users. Numerical experiments illustrate the significant improvements achieved
by the use of such data-driven penalizations.
