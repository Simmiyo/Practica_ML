Multi-view Kernel Completion
In this paper, we introduce the first method that (1) can complete kernel
matrices with completely missing rows and columns as opposed to individual
missing kernel values, (2) does not require any of the kernels to be complete a
priori, and (3) can tackle non-linear kernels. These aspects are necessary in
practical applications such as integrating legacy data sets, learning under
sensor failures and learning when measurements are costly for some of the
views. The proposed approach predicts missing rows by modelling both
within-view and between-view relationships among kernel values. We show, both
on simulated data and real world data, that the proposed method outperforms
existing techniques in the restricted settings where they are available, and
extends applicability to new settings.
