Robust Discriminative Clustering with Sparse Regularizers
Clustering high-dimensional data often requires some form of dimensionality
reduction, where clustered variables are separated from "noise-looking"
variables. We cast this problem as finding a low-dimensional projection of the
data which is well-clustered. This yields a one-dimensional projection in the
simplest situation with two clusters, and extends naturally to a multi-label
scenario for more than two clusters. In this paper, (a) we first show that this
joint clustering and dimension reduction formulation is equivalent to
previously proposed discriminative clustering frameworks, thus leading to
convex relaxations of the problem, (b) we propose a novel sparse extension,
which is still cast as a convex relaxation and allows estimation in higher
dimensions, (c) we propose a natural extension for the multi-label scenario,
(d) we provide a new theoretical analysis of the performance of these
formulations with a simple probabilistic model, leading to scalings over the
form $d=O(\sqrt{n})$ for the affine invariant case and $d=O(n)$ for the sparse
case, where $n$ is the number of examples and $d$ the ambient dimension, and
finally, (e) we propose an efficient iterative algorithm with running-time
complexity proportional to $O(nd^2)$, improving on earlier algorithms which had
quadratic complexity in the number of examples.
