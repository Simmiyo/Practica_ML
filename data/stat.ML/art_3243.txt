Non-stochastic Best Arm Identification and Hyperparameter Optimization
Motivated by the task of hyperparameter optimization, we introduce the
non-stochastic best-arm identification problem. Within the multi-armed bandit
literature, the cumulative regret objective enjoys algorithms and analyses for
both the non-stochastic and stochastic settings while to the best of our
knowledge, the best-arm identification framework has only been considered in
the stochastic setting. We introduce the non-stochastic setting under this
framework, identify a known algorithm that is well-suited for this setting, and
analyze its behavior. Next, by leveraging the iterative nature of standard
machine learning algorithms, we cast hyperparameter optimization as an instance
of non-stochastic best-arm identification, and empirically evaluate our
proposed algorithm on this task. Our empirical results show that, by allocating
more resources to promising hyperparameter settings, we typically achieve
comparable test accuracies an order of magnitude faster than baseline methods.
