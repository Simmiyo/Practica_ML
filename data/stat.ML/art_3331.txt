Market forecasting using Hidden Markov Models
Working on the daily closing prices and logreturns, in this paper we deal
with the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to forecast the price of the
EUR/USD Futures. The aim of our work is to understand how the HMMs describe
different financial time series depending on their structure. Subsequently, we
analyse the forecasting methods exposed in the previous literature, putting on
evidence their pros and cons.
