Further properties of Gaussian Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces
We generalize the orthonormal basis for the Gaussian RKHS described in
\cite{MinhGaussian2010} to an infinite, continuously parametrized, family of
orthonormal bases, along with some implications. The proofs are direct
generalizations of those in \cite{MinhGaussian2010}.
