On the Sample Complexity of Predictive Sparse Coding
The goal of predictive sparse coding is to learn a representation of examples
as sparse linear combinations of elements from a dictionary, such that a
learned hypothesis linear in the new representation performs well on a
predictive task. Predictive sparse coding algorithms recently have demonstrated
impressive performance on a variety of supervised tasks, but their
generalization properties have not been studied. We establish the first
generalization error bounds for predictive sparse coding, covering two
settings: 1) the overcomplete setting, where the number of features k exceeds
the original dimensionality d; and 2) the high or infinite-dimensional setting,
where only dimension-free bounds are useful. Both learning bounds intimately
depend on stability properties of the learned sparse encoder, as measured on
the training sample. Consequently, we first present a fundamental stability
result for the LASSO, a result characterizing the stability of the sparse codes
with respect to perturbations to the dictionary. In the overcomplete setting,
we present an estimation error bound that decays as \tilde{O}(sqrt(d k/m)) with
respect to d and k. In the high or infinite-dimensional setting, we show a
dimension-free bound that is \tilde{O}(sqrt(k^2 s / m)) with respect to k and
s, where s is an upper bound on the number of non-zeros in the sparse code for
any training data point.
