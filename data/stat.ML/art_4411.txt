IVE-GAN: Invariant Encoding Generative Adversarial Networks
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a powerful framework for
generative tasks. However, they are difficult to train and tend to miss modes
of the true data generation process. Although GANs can learn a rich
representation of the covered modes of the data in their latent space, the
framework misses an inverse mapping from data to this latent space. We propose
Invariant Encoding Generative Adversarial Networks (IVE-GANs), a novel GAN
framework that introduces such a mapping for individual samples from the data
by utilizing features in the data which are invariant to certain
transformations. Since the model maps individual samples to the latent space,
it naturally encourages the generator to cover all modes. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in terms of generative performance and learning
rich representations on several datasets including common benchmark image
generation tasks.
