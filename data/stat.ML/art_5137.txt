Causal Effect Identification in Acyclic Directed Mixed Graphs and Gated
  Models
We introduce a new family of graphical models that consists of graphs with
possibly directed, undirected and bidirected edges but without directed cycles.
We show that these models are suitable for representing causal models with
additive error terms. We provide a set of sufficient graphical criteria for the
identification of arbitrary causal effects when the new models contain directed
and undirected edges but no bidirected edge. We also provide a necessary and
sufficient graphical criterion for the identification of the causal effect of a
single variable on the rest of the variables. Moreover, we develop an exact
algorithm for learning the new models from observational and interventional
data via answer set programming. Finally, we introduce gated models for causal
effect identification, a new family of graphical models that exploits context
specific independences to identify additional causal effects.
