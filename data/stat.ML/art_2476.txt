Analytic Feature Selection for Support Vector Machines
Support vector machines (SVMs) rely on the inherent geometry of a data set to
classify training data. Because of this, we believe SVMs are an excellent
candidate to guide the development of an analytic feature selection algorithm,
as opposed to the more commonly used heuristic methods. We propose a
filter-based feature selection algorithm based on the inherent geometry of a
feature set. Through observation, we identified six geometric properties that
differ between optimal and suboptimal feature sets, and have statistically
significant correlations to classifier performance. Our algorithm is based on
logistic and linear regression models using these six geometric properties as
predictor variables. The proposed algorithm achieves excellent results on high
dimensional text data sets, with features that can be organized into a handful
of feature types; for example, unigrams, bigrams or semantic structural
features. We believe this algorithm is a novel and effective approach to
solving the feature selection problem for linear SVMs.
