Under-determined reverberant audio source separation using a full-rank
  spatial covariance model
This article addresses the modeling of reverberant recording environments in
the context of under-determined convolutive blind source separation. We model
the contribution of each source to all mixture channels in the time-frequency
domain as a zero-mean Gaussian random variable whose covariance encodes the
spatial characteristics of the source. We then consider four specific
covariance models, including a full-rank unconstrained model. We derive a
family of iterative expectationmaximization (EM) algorithms to estimate the
parameters of each model and propose suitable procedures to initialize the
parameters and to align the order of the estimated sources across all frequency
bins based on their estimated directions of arrival (DOA). Experimental results
over reverberant synthetic mixtures and live recordings of speech data show the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.
