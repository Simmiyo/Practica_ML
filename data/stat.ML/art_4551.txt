Regularized Kernel Recursive Least Square Algoirthm
In most adaptive signal processing applications, system linearity is assumed
and adaptive linear filters are thus used. The traditional class of supervised
adaptive filters rely on error-correction learning for their adaptive
capability. The kernel method is a powerful nonparametric modeling tool for
pattern analysis and statistical signal processing. Through a nonlinear
mapping, kernel methods transform the data into a set of points in a
Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. KRLS achieves high accuracy and has fast
convergence rate in stationary scenario. However the good performance is
obtained at a cost of high computation complexity. Sparsification in kernel
methods is know to related to less computational complexity and memory
consumption.
