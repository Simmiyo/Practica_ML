Adaptive Cardinality Estimation
In this paper we address cardinality estimation problem which is an important
subproblem in query optimization. Query optimization is a part of every
relational DBMS responsible for finding the best way of the execution for the
given query. These ways are called plans. The execution time of different plans
may differ by several orders, so query optimizer has a great influence on the
whole DBMS performance. We consider cost-based query optimization approach as
the most popular one. It was observed that cost-based optimization quality
depends much on cardinality estimation quality. Cardinality of the plan node is
the number of tuples returned by it.
  In the paper we propose a novel cardinality estimation approach with the use
of machine learning methods. The main point of the approach is using query
execution statistics of the previously executed queries to improve cardinality
estimations. We called this approach adaptive cardinality estimation to reflect
this point. The approach is general, flexible, and easy to implement. The
experimental evaluation shows that this approach significantly increases the
quality of cardinality estimation, and therefore increases the DBMS performance
for some queries by several times or even by several dozens of times.
