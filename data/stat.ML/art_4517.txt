A Topic Model Approach to Multi-Modal Similarity
Calculating similarities between objects defined by many heterogeneous data
modalities is an important challenge in many multimedia applications. We use a
multi-modal topic model as a basis for defining such a similarity between
objects. We propose to compare the resulting similarities from different model
realizations using the non-parametric Mantel test. The approach is evaluated on
a music dataset.
