Max-plus statistical leverage scores
The statistical leverage scores of a complex matrix $A\in\mathbb{C}^{n\times
d}$ record the degree of alignment between col$(A)$ and the coordinate axes in
$\mathbb{C}^n$. These score are used in random sampling algorithms for solving
certain numerical linear algebra problems. In this paper we present a max-plus
algebraic analogue for statistical leverage scores. We show that max-plus
statistical leverage scores can be used to calculate the exact asymptotic
behavior of the conventional statistical leverage scores of a generic matrices
of Puiseux series and also provide a novel way to approximate the conventional
statistical leverage scores of a fixed or complex matrix. The advantage of
approximating a complex matrices scores with max-plus scores is that the
max-plus scores can be computed very quickly. This approximation is typically
accurate to within an order or magnitude and should be useful in practical
problems where the true scores are known to vary widely.
