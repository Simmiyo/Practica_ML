On-line relational SOM for dissimilarity data
In some applications and in order to address real world situations better,
data may be more complex than simple vectors. In some examples, they can be
known through their pairwise dissimilarities only. Several variants of the Self
Organizing Map algorithm were introduced to generalize the original algorithm
to this framework. Whereas median SOM is based on a rough representation of the
prototypes, relational SOM allows representing these prototypes by a virtual
combination of all elements in the data set. However, this latter approach
suffers from two main drawbacks. First, its complexity can be large. Second,
only a batch version of this algorithm has been studied so far and it often
provides results having a bad topographic organization. In this article, an
on-line version of relational SOM is described and justified. The algorithm is
tested on several datasets, including categorical data and graphs, and compared
with the batch version and with other SOM algorithms for non vector data.
