Building Classifiers to Predict the Start of Glucose-Lowering
  Pharmacotherapy Using Belgian Health Expenditure Data
Early diagnosis is important for type 2 diabetes (T2D) to improve patient
prognosis, prevent complications and reduce long-term treatment costs. We
present a novel risk profiling approach based exclusively on health expenditure
data that is available to Belgian mutual health insurers. We used expenditure
data related to drug purchases and medical provisions to construct models that
predict whether a patient will start glucose-lowering pharmacotherapy in the
coming years, based on that patient's recent medical expenditure history. The
design and implementation of the modeling strategy are discussed in detail and
several learning methods are benchmarked for our application. Our best
performing model obtains between 74.9% and 76.8% area under the ROC curve,
which is comparable to state-of-the-art risk prediction approaches for T2D
based on questionnaires. In contrast to other methods, our approach can be
implemented on a population-wide scale at virtually no extra operational cost.
Possibly, our approach can be further improved by additional information about
some risk factors of T2D that is unavailable in health expenditure data.
