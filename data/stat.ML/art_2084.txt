Learning mixtures of spherical Gaussians: moment methods and spectral
  decompositions
This work provides a computationally efficient and statistically consistent
moment-based estimator for mixtures of spherical Gaussians. Under the condition
that component means are in general position, a simple spectral decomposition
technique yields consistent parameter estimates from low-order observable
moments, without additional minimum separation assumptions needed by previous
computationally efficient estimation procedures. Thus computational and
information-theoretic barriers to efficient estimation in mixture models are
precluded when the mixture components have means in general position and
spherical covariances. Some connections are made to estimation problems related
to independent component analysis.
