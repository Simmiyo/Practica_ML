Degenerating families of dendrograms
Dendrograms used in data analysis are ultrametric spaces, hence objects of
nonarchimedean geometry. It is known that there exist $p$-adic representation
of dendrograms. Completed by a point at infinity, they can be viewed as
subtrees of the Bruhat-Tits tree associated to the $p$-adic projective line.
The implications are that certain moduli spaces known in algebraic geometry are
$p$-adic parameter spaces of (families of) dendrograms, and stochastic
classification can also be handled within this framework. At the end, we
calculate the topology of the hidden part of a dendrogram.
