Avoiding pathologies in very deep networks
Choosing appropriate architectures and regularization strategies for deep
networks is crucial to good predictive performance. To shed light on this
problem, we analyze the analogous problem of constructing useful priors on
compositions of functions. Specifically, we study the deep Gaussian process, a
type of infinitely-wide, deep neural network. We show that in standard
architectures, the representational capacity of the network tends to capture
fewer degrees of freedom as the number of layers increases, retaining only a
single degree of freedom in the limit. We propose an alternate network
architecture which does not suffer from this pathology. We also examine deep
covariance functions, obtained by composing infinitely many feature transforms.
Lastly, we characterize the class of models obtained by performing dropout on
Gaussian processes.
