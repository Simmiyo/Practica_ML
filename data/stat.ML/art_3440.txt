Sampling constrained probability distributions using Spherical
  Augmentation
Statistical models with constrained probability distributions are abundant in
machine learning. Some examples include regression models with norm constraints
(e.g., Lasso), probit, many copula models, and latent Dirichlet allocation
(LDA). Bayesian inference involving probability distributions confined to
constrained domains could be quite challenging for commonly used sampling
algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel augmentation technique that
handles a wide range of constraints by mapping the constrained domain to a
sphere in the augmented space. By moving freely on the surface of this sphere,
sampling algorithms handle constraints implicitly and generate proposals that
remain within boundaries when mapped back to the original space. Our proposed
method, called {Spherical Augmentation}, provides a mathematically natural and
computationally efficient framework for sampling from constrained probability
distributions. We show the advantages of our method over state-of-the-art
sampling algorithms, such as exact Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, using several
examples including truncated Gaussian distributions, Bayesian Lasso, Bayesian
bridge regression, reconstruction of quantized stationary Gaussian process, and
LDA for topic modeling.
