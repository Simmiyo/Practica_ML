Structural Data Recognition with Graph Model Boosting
This paper presents a novel method for structural data recognition using a
large number of graph models. In general, prevalent methods for structural data
recognition have two shortcomings: 1) Only a single model is used to capture
structural variation. 2) Naive recognition methods are used, such as the
nearest neighbor method. In this paper, we propose strengthening the
recognition performance of these models as well as their ability to capture
structural variation. The proposed method constructs a large number of graph
models and trains decision trees using the models. This paper makes two main
contributions. The first is a novel graph model that can quickly perform
calculations, which allows us to construct several models in a feasible amount
of time. The second contribution is a novel approach to structural data
recognition: graph model boosting. Comprehensive structural variations can be
captured with a large number of graph models constructed in a boosting
framework, and a sophisticated classifier can be formed by aggregating the
decision trees. Consequently, we can carry out structural data recognition with
powerful recognition capability in the face of comprehensive structural
variation. The experiments shows that the proposed method achieves impressive
results and outperforms existing methods on datasets of IAM graph database
