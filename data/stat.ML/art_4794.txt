Structured Stochastic Linear Bandits
The stochastic linear bandit problem proceeds in rounds where at each round
the algorithm selects a vector from a decision set after which it receives a
noisy linear loss parameterized by an unknown vector. The goal in such a
problem is to minimize the (pseudo) regret which is the difference between the
total expected loss of the algorithm and the total expected loss of the best
fixed vector in hindsight. In this paper, we consider settings where the
unknown parameter has structure, e.g., sparse, group sparse, low-rank, which
can be captured by a norm, e.g., $L_1$, $L_{(1,2)}$, nuclear norm. We focus on
constructing confidence ellipsoids which contain the unknown parameter across
all rounds with high-probability. We show the radius of such ellipsoids depend
on the Gaussian width of sets associated with the norm capturing the structure.
Such characterization leads to tighter confidence ellipsoids and, therefore,
sharper regret bounds compared to bounds in the existing literature which are
based on the ambient dimensionality.
