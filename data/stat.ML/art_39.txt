Escaping the curse of dimensionality with a tree-based regressor
We present the first tree-based regressor whose convergence rate depends only
on the intrinsic dimension of the data, namely its Assouad dimension. The
regressor uses the RPtree partitioning procedure, a simple randomized variant
of k-d trees.
