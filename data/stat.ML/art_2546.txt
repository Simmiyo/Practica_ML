Challenges in Representation Learning: A report on three machine
  learning contests
The ICML 2013 Workshop on Challenges in Representation Learning focused on
three challenges: the black box learning challenge, the facial expression
recognition challenge, and the multimodal learning challenge. We describe the
datasets created for these challenges and summarize the results of the
competitions. We provide suggestions for organizers of future challenges and
some comments on what kind of knowledge can be gained from machine learning
competitions.
