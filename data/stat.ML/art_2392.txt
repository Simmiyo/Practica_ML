On the Consistency of the Bootstrap Approach for Support Vector Machines
  and Related Kernel Based Methods
It is shown that bootstrap approximations of support vector machines (SVMs)
based on a general convex and smooth loss function and on a general kernel are
consistent. This result is useful to approximate the unknown finite sample
distribution of SVMs by the bootstrap approach.
