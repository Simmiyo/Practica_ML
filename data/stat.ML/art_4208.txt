Unperturbed: spectral analysis beyond Davis-Kahan
Classical matrix perturbation results, such as Weyl's theorem for eigenvalues
and the Davis-Kahan theorem for eigenvectors, are general purpose. These
classical bounds are tight in the worst case, but in many settings sub-optimal
in the typical case. In this paper, we present perturbation bounds which
consider the nature of the perturbation and its interaction with the
unperturbed structure in order to obtain significant improvements over the
classical theory in many scenarios, such as when the perturbation is random. We
demonstrate the utility of these new results by analyzing perturbations in the
stochastic blockmodel where we derive much tighter bounds than provided by the
classical theory. We use our new perturbation theory to show that a very simple
and natural clustering algorithm -- whose analysis was difficult using the
classical tools -- nevertheless recovers the communities of the blockmodel
exactly even in very sparse graphs.
