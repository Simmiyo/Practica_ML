Learning Mixtures of Ising Models using Pseudolikelihood
Maximum pseudolikelihood method has been among the most important methods for
learning parameters of statistical physics models, such as Ising models. In
this paper, we study how pseudolikelihood can be derived for learning
parameters of a mixture of Ising models. The performance of the proposed
approach is demonstrated for Ising and Potts models on both synthetic and real
data.
