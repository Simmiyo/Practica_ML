Fast Exact Inference for Recursive Cardinality Models
Cardinality potentials are a generally useful class of high order potential
that affect probabilities based on how many of D binary variables are active.
Maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference for cardinality potential models is
well-understood, with efficient computations taking O(DlogD) time. Yet
efficient marginalization and sampling have not been addressed as thoroughly in
the machine learning community. We show that there exists a simple algorithm
for computing marginal probabilities and drawing exact joint samples that runs
in O(Dlog2 D) time, and we show how to frame the algorithm as efficient belief
propagation in a low order tree-structured model that includes additional
auxiliary variables. We then develop a new, more general class of models,
termed Recursive Cardinality models, which take advantage of this efficiency.
Finally, we show how to do efficient exact inference in models composed of a
tree structure and a cardinality potential. We explore the expressive power of
Recursive Cardinality models and empirically demonstrate their utility.
