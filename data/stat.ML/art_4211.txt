Analysis of dropout learning regarded as ensemble learning
Deep learning is the state-of-the-art in fields such as visual object
recognition and speech recognition. This learning uses a large number of
layers, huge number of units, and connections. Therefore, overfitting is a
serious problem. To avoid this problem, dropout learning is proposed. Dropout
learning neglects some inputs and hidden units in the learning process with a
probability, p, and then, the neglected inputs and hidden units are combined
with the learned network to express the final output. We find that the process
of combining the neglected hidden units with the learned network can be
regarded as ensemble learning, so we analyze dropout learning from this point
of view.
