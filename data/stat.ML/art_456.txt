Context-specific independence in graphical log-linear models
Log-linear models are the popular workhorses of analyzing contingency tables.
A log-linear parameterization of an interaction model can be more expressive
than a direct parameterization based on probabilities, leading to a powerful
way of defining restrictions derived from marginal, conditional and
context-specific independence. However, parameter estimation is often simpler
under a direct parameterization, provided that the model enjoys certain
decomposability properties. Here we introduce a cyclical projection algorithm
for obtaining maximum likelihood estimates of log-linear parameters under an
arbitrary context-specific graphical log-linear model, which needs not satisfy
criteria of decomposability. We illustrate that lifting the restriction of
decomposability makes the models more expressive, such that additional
context-specific independencies embedded in real data can be identified. It is
also shown how a context-specific graphical model can correspond to a
non-hierarchical log-linear parameterization with a concise interpretation.
This observation can pave way to further development of non-hierarchical
log-linear models, which have been largely neglected due to their believed lack
of interpretability.
