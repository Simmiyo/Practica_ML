A Multi-Modal Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Pipeline for Predicting Cancer
  Survival
Cancer survival prediction is an active area of research that can help
prevent unnecessary therapies and improve patient's quality of life. Gene
expression profiling is being widely used in cancer studies to discover
informative biomarkers that aid predict different clinical endpoint prediction.
We use multiple modalities of data derived from RNA deep-sequencing (RNA-seq)
to predict survival of cancer patients. Despite the wealth of information
available in expression profiles of cancer tumors, fulfilling the
aforementioned objective remains a big challenge, for the most part, due to the
paucity of data samples compared to the high dimension of the expression
profiles. As such, analysis of transcriptomic data modalities calls for
state-of-the-art big-data analytics techniques that can maximally use all the
available data to discover the relevant information hidden within a significant
amount of noise. In this paper, we propose a pipeline that predicts cancer
patients' survival by exploiting the structure of the input (manifold learning)
and by leveraging the unlabeled samples using Laplacian support vector
machines, a graph-based semi supervised learning (GSSL) paradigm. We show that
under certain circumstances, no single modality per se will result in the best
accuracy and by fusing different models together via a stacked generalization
strategy, we may boost the accuracy synergistically. We apply our approach to
two cancer datasets and present promising results. We maintain that a similar
pipeline can be used for predictive tasks where labeled samples are expensive
to acquire.
