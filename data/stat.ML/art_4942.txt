Medical image denoising using convolutional denoising autoencoders
Image denoising is an important pre-processing step in medical image
analysis. Different algorithms have been proposed in past three decades with
varying denoising performances. More recently, having outperformed all
conventional methods, deep learning based models have shown a great promise.
These methods are however limited for requirement of large training sample size
and high computational costs. In this paper we show that using small sample
size, denoising autoencoders constructed using convolutional layers can be used
for efficient denoising of medical images. Heterogeneous images can be combined
to boost sample size for increased denoising performance. Simplest of networks
can reconstruct images with corruption levels so high that noise and signal are
not differentiable to human eye.
