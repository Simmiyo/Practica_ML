A Flexible, Scalable and Efficient Algorithmic Framework for Primal
  Graphical Lasso
We propose a scalable, efficient and statistically motivated computational
framework for Graphical Lasso (Friedman et al., 2007b) - a covariance
regularization framework that has received significant attention in the
statistics community over the past few years. Existing algorithms have trouble
in scaling to dimensions larger than a thousand. Our proposal significantly
enhances the state-of-the-art for such moderate sized problems and gracefully
scales to larger problems where other algorithms become practically infeasible.
This requires a few key new ideas. We operate on the primal problem and use a
subtle variation of block-coordinate-methods which drastically reduces the
computational complexity by orders of magnitude. We provide rigorous
theoretical guarantees on the convergence and complexity of our algorithm and
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal via experiments. We believe that
our framework extends the applicability of Graphical Lasso to large-scale
modern applications like bioinformatics, collaborative filtering and social
networks, among others.
