Model-based Classification and Novelty Detection For Point Pattern Data
Point patterns are sets or multi-sets of unordered elements that can be found
in numerous data sources. However, in data analysis tasks such as
classification and novelty detection, appropriate statistical models for point
pattern data have not received much attention. This paper proposes the
modelling of point pattern data via random finite sets (RFS). In particular, we
propose appropriate likelihood functions, and a maximum likelihood estimator
for learning a tractable family of RFS models. In novelty detection, we propose
novel ranking functions based on RFS models, which substantially improve
performance.
