Learning Task Grouping and Overlap in Multi-task Learning
In the paradigm of multi-task learning, mul- tiple related prediction tasks
are learned jointly, sharing information across the tasks. We propose a
framework for multi-task learn- ing that enables one to selectively share the
information across the tasks. We assume that each task parameter vector is a
linear combi- nation of a finite number of underlying basis tasks. The
coefficients of the linear combina- tion are sparse in nature and the overlap
in the sparsity patterns of two tasks controls the amount of sharing across
these. Our model is based on on the assumption that task pa- rameters within a
group lie in a low dimen- sional subspace but allows the tasks in differ- ent
groups to overlap with each other in one or more bases. Experimental results on
four datasets show that our approach outperforms competing methods.
