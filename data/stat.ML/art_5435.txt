Application of backpropagation neural networks to both stages of
  fingerprinting based WIPS
We propose a scheme to employ backpropagation neural networks (BPNNs) for
both stages of fingerprinting-based indoor positioning using WLAN/WiFi signal
strengths (FWIPS): radio map construction during the offline stage, and
localization during the online stage. Given a training radio map (TRM), i.e., a
set of coordinate vectors and associated WLAN/WiFi signal strengths of the
available access points, a BPNN can be trained to output the expected signal
strengths for any input position within the region of interest (BPNN-RM). This
can be used to provide a continuous representation of the radio map and to
filter, densify or decimate a discrete radio map. Correspondingly, the TRM can
also be used to train another BPNN to output the expected position within the
region of interest for any input vector of recorded signal strengths and thus
carry out localization (BPNN-LA).Key aspects of the design of such artificial
neural networks for a specific application are the selection of design
parameters like the number of hidden layers and nodes within the network, and
the training procedure. Summarizing extensive numerical simulations, based on
real measurements in a testbed, we analyze the impact of these design choices
on the performance of the BPNN and compare the results in particular to those
obtained using the $k$ nearest neighbors ($k$NN) and weighted $k$ nearest
neighbors approaches to FWIPS.
