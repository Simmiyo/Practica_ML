Formulas for Counting the Sizes of Markov Equivalence Classes of
  Directed Acyclic Graphs
The sizes of Markov equivalence classes of directed acyclic graphs play
important roles in measuring the uncertainty and complexity in causal learning.
A Markov equivalence class can be represented by an essential graph and its
undirected subgraphs determine the size of the class. In this paper, we develop
a method to derive the formulas for counting the sizes of Markov equivalence
classes. We first introduce a new concept of core graph. The size of a Markov
equivalence class of interest is a polynomial of the number of vertices given
its core graph. Then, we discuss the recursive and explicit formula of the
polynomial, and provide an algorithm to derive the size formula via symbolic
computation for any given core graph. The proposed size formula derivation
sheds light on the relationships between the size of a Markov equivalence class
and its representation graph, and makes size counting efficient, even when the
essential graphs contain non-sparse undirected subgraphs.
