Application of Bayesian Hierarchical Prior Modeling to Sparse Channel
  Estimation
Existing methods for sparse channel estimation typically provide an estimate
computed as the solution maximizing an objective function defined as the sum of
the log-likelihood function and a penalization term proportional to the l1-norm
of the parameter of interest. However, other penalization terms have proven to
have strong sparsity-inducing properties. In this work, we design
pilot-assisted channel estimators for OFDM wireless receivers within the
framework of sparse Bayesian learning by defining hierarchical Bayesian prior
models that lead to sparsity-inducing penalization terms. The estimators result
as an application of the variational message-passing algorithm on the factor
graph representing the signal model extended with the hierarchical prior
models. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of our channel
estimators as compared to traditional and state-of-the-art sparse methods.
