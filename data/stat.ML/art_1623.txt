Percolation Thresholds of Updated Posteriors for Tracking Causal Markov
  Processes in Complex Networks
Percolation on complex networks has been used to study computer viruses,
epidemics, and other casual processes. Here, we present conditions for the
existence of a network specific, observation dependent, phase transition in the
updated posterior of node states resulting from actively monitoring the
network. Since traditional percolation thresholds are derived using observation
independent Markov chains, the threshold of the posterior should more
accurately model the true phase transition of a network, as the updated
posterior more accurately tracks the process. These conditions should provide
insight into modeling the dynamic response of the updated posterior to active
intervention and control policies while monitoring large complex networks.
