Causality on Cross-Sectional Data: Stable Specification Search in
  Constrained Structural Equation Modeling
Causal modeling has long been an attractive topic for many researchers and in
recent decades there has seen a surge in theoretical development and discovery
algorithms. Generally discovery algorithms can be divided into two approaches:
constraint-based and score-based. The constraint-based approach is able to
detect common causes of the observed variables but the use of independence
tests makes it less reliable. The score-based approach produces a result that
is easier to interpret as it also measures the reliability of the inferred
causal relationships, but it is unable to detect common confounders of the
observed variables. A drawback of both score-based and constrained-based
approaches is the inherent instability in structure estimation. With finite
samples small changes in the data can lead to completely different optimal
structures. The present work introduces a new hypothesis-free score-based
causal discovery algorithm, called stable specification search, that is robust
for finite samples based on recent advances in stability selection using
subsampling and selection algorithms. Structure search is performed over
Structural Equation Models. Our approach uses exploratory search but allows
incorporation of prior background knowledge. We validated our approach on one
simulated data set, which we compare to the known ground truth, and two
real-world data sets for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder, which we compare to earlier medical studies. The
results on the simulated data set show significant improvement over alternative
approaches and the results on the real-word data sets show consistency with the
hypothesis driven models constructed by medical experts.
