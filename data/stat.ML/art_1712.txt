How the result of graph clustering methods depends on the construction
  of the graph
We study the scenario of graph-based clustering algorithms such as spectral
clustering. Given a set of data points, one first has to construct a graph on
the data points and then apply a graph clustering algorithm to find a suitable
partition of the graph. Our main question is if and how the construction of the
graph (choice of the graph, choice of parameters, choice of weights) influences
the outcome of the final clustering result. To this end we study the
convergence of cluster quality measures such as the normalized cut or the
Cheeger cut on various kinds of random geometric graphs as the sample size
tends to infinity. It turns out that the limit values of the same objective
function are systematically different on different types of graphs. This
implies that clustering results systematically depend on the graph and can be
very different for different types of graph. We provide examples to illustrate
the implications on spectral clustering.
