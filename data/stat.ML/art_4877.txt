Personalization Effect on Emotion Recognition from Physiological Data:
  An Investigation of Performance on Different Setups and Classifiers
This paper addresses the problem of emotion recognition from physiological
signals. Features are extracted and ranked based on their effect on
classification accuracy. Different classifiers are compared. The inter-subject
variability and the personalization effect are thoroughly investigated, through
trial-based and subject-based cross-validation. Finally, a personalized model
is introduced, that would allow for enhanced emotional state prediction, based
on the physiological data of subjects that exhibit a certain degree of
similarity, without the requirement of further feedback.
