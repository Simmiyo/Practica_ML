Bayesian Optimal Control of Smoothly Parameterized Systems: The Lazy
  Posterior Sampling Algorithm
We study Bayesian optimal control of a general class of smoothly
parameterized Markov decision problems. Since computing the optimal control is
computationally expensive, we design an algorithm that trades off performance
for computational efficiency. The algorithm is a lazy posterior sampling method
that maintains a distribution over the unknown parameter. The algorithm changes
its policy only when the variance of the distribution is reduced sufficiently.
Importantly, we analyze the algorithm and show the precise nature of the
performance vs. computation tradeoff. Finally, we show the effectiveness of the
method on a web server control application.
