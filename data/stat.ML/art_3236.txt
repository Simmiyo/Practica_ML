A Review of Audio Features and Statistical Models Exploited for Voice
  Pattern Design
Audio fingerprinting, also named as audio hashing, has been well-known as a
powerful technique to perform audio identification and synchronization. It
basically involves two major steps: fingerprint (voice pattern) design and
matching search. While the first step concerns the derivation of a robust and
compact audio signature, the second step usually requires knowledge about
database and quick-search algorithms. Though this technique offers a wide range
of real-world applications, to the best of the authors' knowledge, a
comprehensive survey of existing algorithms appeared more than eight years ago.
Thus, in this paper, we present a more up-to-date review and, for emphasizing
on the audio signal processing aspect, we focus our state-of-the-art survey on
the fingerprint design step for which various audio features and their
tractable statistical models are discussed.
