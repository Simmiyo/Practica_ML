Dealing with Range Anxiety in Mean Estimation via Statistical Queries
We give algorithms for estimating the expectation of a given real-valued
function $\phi:X\to {\bf R}$ on a sample drawn randomly from some unknown
distribution $D$ over domain $X$, namely ${\bf E}_{{\bf x}\sim D}[\phi({\bf
x})]$. Our algorithms work in two well-studied models of restricted access to
data samples. The first one is the statistical query (SQ) model in which an
algorithm has access to an SQ oracle for the input distribution $D$ over $X$
instead of i.i.d. samples from $D$. Given a query function $\phi:X \to [0,1]$,
the oracle returns an estimate of ${\bf E}_{{\bf x}\sim D}[\phi({\bf x})]$
within some tolerance $\tau$. The second, is a model in which only a single bit
is communicated from each sample. In both of these models the error obtained
using a naive implementation would scale polynomially with the range of the
random variable $\phi({\bf x})$ (which might even be infinite). In contrast,
without restrictions on access to data the expected error scales with the
standard deviation of $\phi({\bf x})$. Here we give a simple algorithm whose
error scales linearly in standard deviation of $\phi({\bf x})$ and
logarithmically with an upper bound on the second moment of $\phi({\bf x})$.
  As corollaries, we obtain algorithms for high dimensional mean estimation and
stochastic convex optimization in these models that work in more general
settings than previously known solutions.
