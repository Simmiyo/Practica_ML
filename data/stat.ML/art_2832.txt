Bayesian Optimization with Unknown Constraints
Recent work on Bayesian optimization has shown its effectiveness in global
optimization of difficult black-box objective functions. Many real-world
optimization problems of interest also have constraints which are unknown a
priori. In this paper, we study Bayesian optimization for constrained problems
in the general case that noise may be present in the constraint functions, and
the objective and constraints may be evaluated independently. We provide
motivating practical examples, and present a general framework to solve such
problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on optimizing the
performance of online latent Dirichlet allocation subject to topic sparsity
constraints, tuning a neural network given test-time memory constraints, and
optimizing Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to achieve maximal effectiveness in a fixed
time, subject to passing standard convergence diagnostics.
