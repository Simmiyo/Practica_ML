Interpretable Machine Learning Models for the Digital Clock Drawing Test
The Clock Drawing Test (CDT) is a rapid, inexpensive, and popular
neuropsychological screening tool for cognitive conditions. The Digital Clock
Drawing Test (dCDT) uses novel software to analyze data from a digitizing
ballpoint pen that reports its position with considerable spatial and temporal
precision, making possible the analysis of both the drawing process and final
product. We developed methodology to analyze pen stroke data from these
drawings, and computed a large collection of features which were then analyzed
with a variety of machine learning techniques. The resulting scoring systems
were designed to be more accurate than the systems currently used by
clinicians, but just as interpretable and easy to use. The systems also allow
us to quantify the tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability. We created
automated versions of the CDT scoring systems currently used by clinicians,
allowing us to benchmark our models, which indicated that our machine learning
models substantially outperformed the existing scoring systems.
