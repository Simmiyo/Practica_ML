HIPAD - A Hybrid Interior-Point Alternating Direction algorithm for
  knowledge-based SVM and feature selection
We consider classification tasks in the regime of scarce labeled training
data in high dimensional feature space, where specific expert knowledge is also
available. We propose a new hybrid optimization algorithm that solves the
elastic-net support vector machine (SVM) through an alternating direction
method of multipliers in the first phase, followed by an interior-point method
for the classical SVM in the second phase. Both SVM formulations are adapted to
knowledge incorporation. Our proposed algorithm addresses the challenges of
automatic feature selection, high optimization accuracy, and algorithmic
flexibility for taking advantage of prior knowledge. We demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm and compare it with existing
methods on a collection of synthetic and real-world data.
