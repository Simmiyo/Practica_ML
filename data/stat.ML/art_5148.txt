Reproducible Pattern Recognition Research: The Case of Optimistic SSL
In this paper, we discuss the approaches we took and trade-offs involved in
making a paper on a conceptual topic in pattern recognition research fully
reproducible. We discuss our definition of reproducibility, the tools used, how
the analysis was set up, show some examples of alternative analyses the code
enables and discuss our views on reproducibility.
