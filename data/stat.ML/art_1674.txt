Distributed Algorithms for Learning and Cognitive Medium Access with
  Logarithmic Regret
The problem of distributed learning and channel access is considered in a
cognitive network with multiple secondary users. The availability statistics of
the channels are initially unknown to the secondary users and are estimated
using sensing decisions. There is no explicit information exchange or prior
agreement among the secondary users. We propose policies for distributed
learning and access which achieve order-optimal cognitive system throughput
(number of successful secondary transmissions) under self play, i.e., when
implemented at all the secondary users. Equivalently, our policies minimize the
regret in distributed learning and access. We first consider the scenario when
the number of secondary users is known to the policy, and prove that the total
regret is logarithmic in the number of transmission slots. Our distributed
learning and access policy achieves order-optimal regret by comparing to an
asymptotic lower bound for regret under any uniformly-good learning and access
policy. We then consider the case when the number of secondary users is fixed
but unknown, and is estimated through feedback. We propose a policy in this
scenario whose asymptotic sum regret which grows slightly faster than
logarithmic in the number of transmission slots.
