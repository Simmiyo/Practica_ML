On the underestimation of model uncertainty by Bayesian K-nearest
  neighbors
When using the K-nearest neighbors method, one often ignores uncertainty in
the choice of K. To account for such uncertainty, Holmes and Adams (2002)
proposed a Bayesian framework for K-nearest neighbors (KNN). Their Bayesian KNN
(BKNN) approach uses a pseudo-likelihood function, and standard Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to draw posterior samples. Holmes and Adams
(2002) focused on the performance of BKNN in terms of misclassification error
but did not assess its ability to quantify uncertainty. We present some
evidence to show that BKNN still significantly underestimates model
uncertainty.
