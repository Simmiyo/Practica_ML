A Stratified Analysis of Bayesian Optimization Methods
Empirical analysis serves as an important complement to theoretical analysis
for studying practical Bayesian optimization. Often empirical insights expose
strengths and weaknesses inaccessible to theoretical analysis. We define two
metrics for comparing the performance of Bayesian optimization methods and
propose a ranking mechanism for summarizing performance within various genres
or strata of test functions. These test functions serve to mimic the complexity
of hyperparameter optimization problems, the most prominent application of
Bayesian optimization, but with a closed form which allows for rapid evaluation
and more predictable behavior. This offers a flexible and efficient way to
investigate functions with specific properties of interest, such as oscillatory
behavior or an optimum on the domain boundary.
