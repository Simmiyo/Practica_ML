Content-boosted Matrix Factorization Techniques for Recommender Systems
Many businesses are using recommender systems for marketing outreach.
Recommendation algorithms can be either based on content or driven by
collaborative filtering. We study different ways to incorporate content
information directly into the matrix factorization approach of collaborative
filtering. These content-boosted matrix factorization algorithms not only
improve recommendation accuracy, but also provide useful insights about the
contents, as well as make recommendations more easily interpretable.
