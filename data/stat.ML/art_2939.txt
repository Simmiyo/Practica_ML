NMF with Sparse Regularizations in Transformed Domains
Non-negative blind source separation (non-negative BSS), which is also
referred to as non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), is a very active field
in domains as different as astrophysics, audio processing or biomedical signal
processing. In this context, the efficient retrieval of the sources requires
the use of signal priors such as sparsity. If NMF has now been well studied
with sparse constraints in the direct domain, only very few algorithms can
encompass non-negativity together with sparsity in a transformed domain since
simultaneously dealing with two priors in two different domains is challenging.
In this article, we show how a sparse NMF algorithm coined non-negative
generalized morphological component analysis (nGMCA) can be extended to impose
non-negativity in the direct domain along with sparsity in a transformed
domain, with both analysis and synthesis formulations. To our knowledge, this
work presents the first comparison of analysis and synthesis priors ---as well
as their reweighted versions--- in the context of blind source separation.
Comparisons with state-of-the-art NMF algorithms on realistic data show the
efficiency as well as the robustness of the proposed algorithms.
