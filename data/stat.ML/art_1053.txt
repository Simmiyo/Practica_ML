ROCS-Derived Features for Virtual Screening
Rapid overlay of chemical structures (ROCS) is a standard tool for the
calculation of 3D shape and chemical ("color") similarity. ROCS uses unweighted
sums to combine many aspects of similarity, yielding parameter-free models for
virtual screening. In this report, we decompose the ROCS color force field into
"color components" and "color atom overlaps", novel color similarity features
that can be weighted in a system-specific manner by machine learning
algorithms. In cross-validation experiments, these additional features
significantly improve virtual screening performance (ROC AUC scores) relative
to standard ROCS.
