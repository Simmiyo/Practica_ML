Parametric Return Density Estimation for Reinforcement Learning
Most conventional Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms aim to optimize
decision-making rules in terms of the expected returns. However, especially for
risk management purposes, other risk-sensitive criteria such as the
value-at-risk or the expected shortfall are sometimes preferred in real
applications. Here, we describe a parametric method for estimating density of
the returns, which allows us to handle various criteria in a unified manner. We
first extend the Bellman equation for the conditional expected return to cover
a conditional probability density of the returns. Then we derive an extension
of the TD-learning algorithm for estimating the return densities in an unknown
environment. As test instances, several parametric density estimation
algorithms are presented for the Gaussian, Laplace, and skewed Laplace
distributions. We show that these algorithms lead to risk-sensitive as well as
robust RL paradigms through numerical experiments.
