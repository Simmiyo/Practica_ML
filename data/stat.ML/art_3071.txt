Iterated geometric harmonics for data imputation and reconstruction of
  missing data
The method of geometric harmonics is adapted to the situation of incomplete
data by means of the iterated geometric harmonics (IGH) scheme. The method is
tested on natural and synthetic data sets with 50--500 data points and
dimensionality of 400--10,000. Experiments suggest that the algorithm converges
to a near optimal solution within 4--6 iterations, at runtimes of less than 30
minutes on a medium-grade desktop computer. The imputation of missing data
values is applied to collections of damaged images (suffering from data
annihilation rates of up to 70\%) which are reconstructed with a surprising
degree of accuracy.
