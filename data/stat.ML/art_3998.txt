Kernel Bandwidth Selection for SVDD: Peak Criterion Approach for Large
  Data
Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) provides a useful approach to
construct a description of multivariate data for single-class classification
and outlier detection with various practical applications. Gaussian kernel used
in SVDD formulation allows flexible data description defined by observations
designated as support vectors. The data boundary of such description is
non-spherical and conforms to the geometric features of the data. By varying
the Gaussian kernel bandwidth parameter, the SVDD-generated boundary can be
made either smoother (more spherical) or tighter/jagged. The former case may
lead to under-fitting, whereas the latter may result in overfitting. Peak
criterion has been proposed to select an optimal value of the kernel bandwidth
to strike the balance between the data boundary smoothness and its ability to
capture the general geometric shape of the data. Peak criterion involves
training SVDD at various values of the kernel bandwidth parameter. When
training datasets are large, the time required to obtain the optimal value of
the Gaussian kernel bandwidth parameter according to Peak method can become
prohibitively large. This paper proposes an extension of Peak method for the
case of large data. The proposed method gives good results when applied to
several datasets. Two existing alternative methods of computing the Gaussian
kernel bandwidth parameter (Coefficient of Variation and Distance to the
Farthest Neighbor) were modified to allow comparison with the proposed method
on convergence. Empirical comparison demonstrates the advantage of the proposed
method.
