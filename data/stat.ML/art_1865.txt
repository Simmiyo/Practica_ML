Semi-supervised Learning with Density Based Distances
We present a simple, yet effective, approach to Semi-Supervised Learning. Our
approach is based on estimating density-based distances (DBD) using a shortest
path calculation on a graph. These Graph-DBD estimates can then be used in any
distance-based supervised learning method, such as Nearest Neighbor methods and
SVMs with RBF kernels. In order to apply the method to very large data sets, we
also present a novel algorithm which integrates nearest neighbor computations
into the shortest path search and can find exact shortest paths even in
extremely large dense graphs. Significant runtime improvement over the commonly
used Laplacian regularization method is then shown on a large scale dataset.
