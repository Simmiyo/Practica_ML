Herding as a Learning System with Edge-of-Chaos Dynamics
Herding defines a deterministic dynamical system at the edge of chaos. It
generates a sequence of model states and parameters by alternating parameter
perturbations with state maximizations, where the sequence of states can be
interpreted as "samples" from an associated MRF model. Herding differs from
maximum likelihood estimation in that the sequence of parameters does not
converge to a fixed point and differs from an MCMC posterior sampling approach
in that the sequence of states is generated deterministically. Herding may be
interpreted as a"perturb and map" method where the parameter perturbations are
generated using a deterministic nonlinear dynamical system rather than randomly
from a Gumbel distribution. This chapter studies the distinct statistical
characteristics of the herding algorithm and shows that the fast convergence
rate of the controlled moments may be attributed to edge of chaos dynamics. The
herding algorithm can also be generalized to models with latent variables and
to a discriminative learning setting. The perceptron cycling theorem ensures
that the fast moment matching property is preserved in the more general
framework.
