Simple approximate MAP Inference for Dirichlet processes
The Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) is a ubiquitous, flexible Bayesian
nonparametric statistical model. However, full probabilistic inference in this
model is analytically intractable, so that computationally intensive techniques
such as Gibb's sampling are required. As a result, DPM-based methods, which
have considerable potential, are restricted to applications in which
computational resources and time for inference is plentiful. For example, they
would not be practical for digital signal processing on embedded hardware,
where computational resources are at a serious premium. Here, we develop
simplified yet statistically rigorous approximate maximum a-posteriori (MAP)
inference algorithms for DPMs. This algorithm is as simple as K-means
clustering, performs in experiments as well as Gibb's sampling, while requiring
only a fraction of the computational effort. Unlike related small variance
asymptotics, our algorithm is non-degenerate and so inherits the "rich get
richer" property of the Dirichlet process. It also retains a non-degenerate
closed-form likelihood which enables standard tools such as cross-validation to
be used. This is a well-posed approximation to the MAP solution of the
probabilistic DPM model.
