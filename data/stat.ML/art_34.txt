Missing Data using Decision Forest and Computational Intelligence
Autoencoder neural network is implemented to estimate the missing data.
Genetic algorithm is implemented for network optimization and estimating the
missing data. Missing data is treated as Missing At Random mechanism by
implementing maximum likelihood algorithm. The network performance is
determined by calculating the mean square error of the network prediction. The
network is further optimized by implementing Decision Forest. The impact of
missing data is then investigated and decision forrests are found to improve
the results.
