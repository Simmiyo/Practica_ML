Exponential Families for Conditional Random Fields
In this paper we de ne conditional random elds in reproducing kernel Hilbert
spaces and show connections to Gaussian Process classi cation. More speci
cally, we prove decomposition results for undirected graphical models and we
give constructions for kernels. Finally we present e cient means of solving the
optimization problem using reduced rank decompositions and we show how
stationarity can be exploited e ciently in the optimization process.
