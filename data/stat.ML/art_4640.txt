A Probabilistic Adaptive Search System for Exploring the Face Space
Face recall is a basic human cognitive process performed routinely, e.g.,
when meeting someone and determining if we have met that person before.
Assisting a subject during face recall by suggesting candidate faces can be
challenging. One of the reasons is that the search space - the face space - is
quite large and lacks structure. A commercial application of face recall is
facial composite systems - such as Identikit, PhotoFIT, and CD-FIT - where a
witness searches for an image of a face that resembles his memory of a
particular offender. The inherent uncertainty and cost in the evaluation of the
objective function, the large size and lack of structure of the search space,
and the unavailability of the gradient concept makes this problem inappropriate
for traditional optimization methods. In this paper we propose a novel
evolutionary approach for searching the face space that can be used as a facial
composite system. The approach is inspired by methods of Bayesian optimization
and differs from other applications in the use of the skew-normal distribution
as its acquisition function. This choice of acquisition function provides
greater granularity, with regularized, conservative, and realistic results.
