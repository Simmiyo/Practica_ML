Modeling and interpolation of the ambient magnetic field by Gaussian
  processes
Anomalies in the ambient magnetic field can be used as features in indoor
positioning and navigation. By using Maxwell's equations, we derive and present
a Bayesian non-parametric probabilistic modeling approach for interpolation and
extrapolation of the magnetic field. We model the magnetic field components
jointly by imposing a Gaussian process (GP) prior on the latent scalar
potential of the magnetic field. By rewriting the GP model in terms of a
Hilbert space representation, we circumvent the computational pitfalls
associated with GP modeling and provide a computationally efficient and
physically justified modeling tool for the ambient magnetic field. The model
allows for sequential updating of the estimate and time-dependent changes in
the magnetic field. The model is shown to work well in practice in different
applications: we demonstrate mapping of the magnetic field both with an
inexpensive Raspberry Pi powered robot and on foot using a standard smartphone.
