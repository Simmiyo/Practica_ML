Distributed Multitask Learning
We consider the problem of distributed multi-task learning, where each
machine learns a separate, but related, task. Specifically, each machine learns
a linear predictor in high-dimensional space,where all tasks share the same
small support. We present a communication-efficient estimator based on the
debiased lasso and show that it is comparable with the optimal centralized
method.
