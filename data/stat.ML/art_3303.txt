Tensor machines for learning target-specific polynomial features
Recent years have demonstrated that using random feature maps can
significantly decrease the training and testing times of kernel-based
algorithms without significantly lowering their accuracy. Regrettably, because
random features are target-agnostic, typically thousands of such features are
necessary to achieve acceptable accuracies. In this work, we consider the
problem of learning a small number of explicit polynomial features. Our
approach, named Tensor Machines, finds a parsimonious set of features by
optimizing over the hypothesis class introduced by Kar and Karnick for random
feature maps in a target-specific manner. Exploiting a natural connection
between polynomials and tensors, we provide bounds on the generalization error
of Tensor Machines. Empirically, Tensor Machines behave favorably on several
real-world datasets compared to other state-of-the-art techniques for learning
polynomial features, and deliver significantly more parsimonious models.
