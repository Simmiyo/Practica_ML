Scalable Object Detection using Deep Neural Networks
Deep convolutional neural networks have recently achieved state-of-the-art
performance on a number of image recognition benchmarks, including the ImageNet
Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC-2012). The winning model on
the localization sub-task was a network that predicts a single bounding box and
a confidence score for each object category in the image. Such a model captures
the whole-image context around the objects but cannot handle multiple instances
of the same object in the image without naively replicating the number of
outputs for each instance. In this work, we propose a saliency-inspired neural
network model for detection, which predicts a set of class-agnostic bounding
boxes along with a single score for each box, corresponding to its likelihood
of containing any object of interest. The model naturally handles a variable
number of instances for each class and allows for cross-class generalization at
the highest levels of the network. We are able to obtain competitive
recognition performance on VOC2007 and ILSVRC2012, while using only the top few
predicted locations in each image and a small number of neural network
evaluations.
