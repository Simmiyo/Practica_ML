Kernel-based Conditional Independence Test and Application in Causal
  Discovery
Conditional independence testing is an important problem, especially in
Bayesian network learning and causal discovery. Due to the curse of
dimensionality, testing for conditional independence of continuous variables is
particularly challenging. We propose a Kernel-based Conditional Independence
test (KCI-test), by constructing an appropriate test statistic and deriving its
asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis of conditional independence.
The proposed method is computationally efficient and easy to implement.
Experimental results show that it outperforms other methods, especially when
the conditioning set is large or the sample size is not very large, in which
case other methods encounter difficulties.
