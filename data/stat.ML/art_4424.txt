An Adaptive Strategy for Active Learning with Smooth Decision Boundary
We present the first adaptive strategy for active learning in the setting of
classification with smooth decision boundary. The problem of adaptivity (to
unknown distributional parameters) has remained opened since the seminal work
of Castro and Nowak (2007), which first established (active learning) rates for
this setting. While some recent advances on this problem establish adaptive
rates in the case of univariate data, adaptivity in the more practical setting
of multivariate data has so far remained elusive. Combining insights from
various recent works, we show that, for the multivariate case, a careful
reduction to univariate-adaptive strategies yield near-optimal rates without
prior knowledge of distributional parameters.
