Detecting Relative Anomaly
System states that are anomalous from the perspective of a domain expert
occur frequently in some anomaly detection problems. The performance of
commonly used unsupervised anomaly detection methods may suffer in that
setting, because they use frequency as a proxy for anomaly. We propose a novel
concept for anomaly detection, called relative anomaly detection. It is
tailored to be robust towards anomalies that occur frequently, by taking into
account their location relative to the most typical observations. The
approaches we develop are computationally feasible even for large data sets,
and they allow real-time detection. We illustrate using data sets of potential
scraping attempts and Wi-Fi channel utilization, both from Google, Inc.
