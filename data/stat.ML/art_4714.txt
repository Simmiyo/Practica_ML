Local Region Sparse Learning for Image-on-Scalar Regression
Identification of regions of interest (ROI) associated with certain disease
has a great impact on public health. Imposing sparsity of pixel values and
extracting active regions simultaneously greatly complicate the image analysis.
We address these challenges by introducing a novel region-selection penalty in
the framework of image-on-scalar regression. Our penalty combines the Smoothly
Clipped Absolute Deviation (SCAD) regularization, enforcing sparsity, and the
SCAD of total variation (TV) regularization, enforcing spatial contiguity, into
one group, which segments contiguous spatial regions against zero-valued
background. Efficient algorithm is based on the alternative direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) which decomposes the non-convex problem into two iterative
optimization problems with explicit solutions. Another virtue of the proposed
method is that a divide and conquer learning algorithm is developed, thereby
allowing scaling to large images. Several examples are presented and the
experimental results are compared with other state-of-the-art approaches.
