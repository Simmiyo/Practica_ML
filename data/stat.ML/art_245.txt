On the Incommensurability Phenomenon
Suppose that two large, multi-dimensional data sets are each noisy
measurements of the same underlying random process, and principle components
analysis is performed separately on the data sets to reduce their
dimensionality. In some circumstances it may happen that the two
lower-dimensional data sets have an inordinately large Procrustean
fitting-error between them. The purpose of this manuscript is to quantify this
"incommensurability phenomenon." In particular, under specified conditions, the
square Procrustean fitting-error of the two normalized lower-dimensional data
sets is (asymptotically) a convex combination (via a correlation parameter) of
the Hausdorff distance between the projection subspaces and the maximum
possible value of the square Procrustean fitting-error for normalized data. We
show how this gives rise to the incommensurability phenomenon, and we employ
illustrative simulations as well as a real data experiment to explore how the
incommensurability phenomenon may have an appreciable impact.
