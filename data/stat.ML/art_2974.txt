BET: Bayesian Ensemble Trees for Clustering and Prediction in
  Heterogeneous Data
We propose a novel "tree-averaging" model that utilizes the ensemble of
classification and regression trees (CART). Each constituent tree is estimated
with a subset of similar data. We treat this grouping of subsets as Bayesian
ensemble trees (BET) and model them as an infinite mixture Dirichlet process.
We show that BET adapts to data heterogeneity and accurately estimates each
component. Compared with the bootstrap-aggregating approach, BET shows improved
prediction performance with fewer trees. We develop an efficient estimating
procedure with improved sampling strategies in both CART and mixture models. We
demonstrate these advantages of BET with simulations, classification of breast
cancer and regression of lung function measurement of cystic fibrosis patients.
