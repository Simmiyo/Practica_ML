Building Ensembles of Adaptive Nested Dichotomies with Random-Pair
  Selection
A system of nested dichotomies is a method of decomposing a multi-class
problem into a collection of binary problems. Such a system recursively splits
the set of classes into two subsets, and trains a binary classifier to
distinguish between each subset. Even though ensembles of nested dichotomies
with random structure have been shown to perform well in practice, using a more
sophisticated class subset selection method can be used to improve
classification accuracy. We investigate an approach to this problem called
random-pair selection, and evaluate its effectiveness compared to other
published methods of subset selection. We show that our method outperforms
other methods in many cases when forming ensembles of nested dichotomies, and
is at least on par in all other cases.
