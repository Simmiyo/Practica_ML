Alternative Markov and Causal Properties for Acyclic Directed Mixed
  Graphs
We extend Andersson-Madigan-Perlman chain graphs by (i) relaxing the
semidirected acyclity constraint so that only directed cycles are forbidden,
and (ii) allowing up to two edges between any pair of nodes. We introduce
global, and ordered local and pairwise Markov properties for the new models. We
show the equivalence of these properties for strictly positive probability
distributions. We also show that when the random variables are continuous, the
new models can be interpreted as systems of structural equations with
correlated errors. This enables us to adapt Pearl's do-calculus to them.
Finally, we describe an exact algorithm for learning the new models from
observational and interventional data via answer set programming.
