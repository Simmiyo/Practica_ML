The Bayesian Low-Rank Determinantal Point Process Mixture Model
Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are an elegant model for encoding
probabilities over subsets, such as shopping baskets, of a ground set, such as
an item catalog. They are useful for a number of machine learning tasks,
including product recommendation. DPPs are parametrized by a positive
semi-definite kernel matrix. Recent work has shown that using a low-rank
factorization of this kernel provides remarkable scalability improvements that
open the door to training on large-scale datasets and computing online
recommendations, both of which are infeasible with standard DPP models that use
a full-rank kernel. In this paper we present a low-rank DPP mixture model that
allows us to represent the latent structure present in observed subsets as a
mixture of a number of component low-rank DPPs, where each component DPP is
responsible for representing a portion of the observed data. The mixture model
allows us to effectively address the capacity constraints of the low-rank DPP
model. We present an efficient and scalable Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
learning algorithm for our model that uses Gibbs sampling and stochastic
gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC). Using an evaluation on several
real-world product recommendation datasets, we show that our low-rank DPP
mixture model provides substantially better predictive performance than is
possible with a single low-rank or full-rank DPP, and significantly better
performance than several other competing recommendation methods in many cases.
