Modern hierarchical, agglomerative clustering algorithms
This paper presents algorithms for hierarchical, agglomerative clustering
which perform most efficiently in the general-purpose setup that is given in
modern standard software. Requirements are: (1) the input data is given by
pairwise dissimilarities between data points, but extensions to vector data are
also discussed (2) the output is a "stepwise dendrogram", a data structure
which is shared by all implementations in current standard software. We present
algorithms (old and new) which perform clustering in this setting efficiently,
both in an asymptotic worst-case analysis and from a practical point of view.
The main contributions of this paper are: (1) We present a new algorithm which
is suitable for any distance update scheme and performs significantly better
than the existing algorithms. (2) We prove the correctness of two algorithms by
Rohlf and Murtagh, which is necessary in each case for different reasons. (3)
We give well-founded recommendations for the best current algorithms for the
various agglomerative clustering schemes.
