Human Daily Activities Indexing in Videos from Wearable Cameras for
  Monitoring of Patients with Dementia Diseases
Our research focuses on analysing human activities according to a known
behaviorist scenario, in case of noisy and high dimensional collected data. The
data come from the monitoring of patients with dementia diseases by wearable
cameras. We define a structural model of video recordings based on a Hidden
Markov Model. New spatio-temporal features, color features and localization
features are proposed as observations. First results in recognition of
activities are promising.
