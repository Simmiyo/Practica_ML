Gaussian Processes and Limiting Linear Models
Gaussian processes retain the linear model either as a special case, or in
the limit. We show how this relationship can be exploited when the data are at
least partially linear. However from the perspective of the Bayesian posterior,
the Gaussian processes which encode the linear model either have probability of
nearly zero or are otherwise unattainable without the explicit construction of
a prior with the limiting linear model in mind. We develop such a prior, and
show that its practical benefits extend well beyond the computational and
conceptual simplicity of the linear model. For example, linearity can be
extracted on a per-dimension basis, or can be combined with treed partition
models to yield a highly efficient nonstationary model. Our approach is
demonstrated on synthetic and real datasets of varying linearity and
dimensionality.
