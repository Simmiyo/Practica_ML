Scalable Kernel Methods via Doubly Stochastic Gradients
The general perception is that kernel methods are not scalable, and neural
nets are the methods of choice for nonlinear learning problems. Or have we
simply not tried hard enough for kernel methods? Here we propose an approach
that scales up kernel methods using a novel concept called "doubly stochastic
functional gradients". Our approach relies on the fact that many kernel methods
can be expressed as convex optimization problems, and we solve the problems by
making two unbiased stochastic approximations to the functional gradient, one
using random training points and another using random functions associated with
the kernel, and then descending using this noisy functional gradient. We show
that a function produced by this procedure after $t$ iterations converges to
the optimal function in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space in rate $O(1/t)$,
and achieves a generalization performance of $O(1/\sqrt{t})$. This doubly
stochasticity also allows us to avoid keeping the support vectors and to
implement the algorithm in a small memory footprint, which is linear in number
of iterations and independent of data dimension. Our approach can readily scale
kernel methods up to the regimes which are dominated by neural nets. We show
that our method can achieve competitive performance to neural nets in datasets
such as 8 million handwritten digits from MNIST, 2.3 million energy materials
from MolecularSpace, and 1 million photos from ImageNet.
