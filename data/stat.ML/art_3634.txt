Robust Elastic Net Regression
We propose a robust elastic net (REN) model for high-dimensional sparse
regression and give its performance guarantees (both the statistical error
bound and the optimization bound). A simple idea of trimming the inner product
is applied to the elastic net model. Specifically, we robustify the covariance
matrix by trimming the inner product based on the intuition that the trimmed
inner product can not be significant affected by a bounded number of
arbitrarily corrupted points (outliers). The REN model can also derive two
interesting special cases: robust Lasso and robust soft thresholding.
Comprehensive experimental results show that the robustness of the proposed
model consistently outperforms the original elastic net and matches the
performance guarantees nicely.
