Kernel Alignment Inspired Linear Discriminant Analysis
Kernel alignment measures the degree of similarity between two kernels. In
this paper, inspired from kernel alignment, we propose a new Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA) formulation, kernel alignment LDA (kaLDA). We first
define two kernels, data kernel and class indicator kernel. The problem is to
find a subspace to maximize the alignment between subspace-transformed data
kernel and class indicator kernel. Surprisingly, the kernel alignment induced
kaLDA objective function is very similar to classical LDA and can be expressed
using between-class and total scatter matrices. This can be extended to
multi-label data. We use a Stiefel-manifold gradient descent algorithm to solve
this problem. We perform experiments on 8 single-label and 6 multi-label data
sets. Results show that kaLDA has very good performance on many single-label
and multi-label problems.
