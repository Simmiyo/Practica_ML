Intrinsic Non-stationary Covariance Function for Climate Modeling
Designing a covariance function that represents the underlying correlation is
a crucial step in modeling complex natural systems, such as climate models.
Geospatial datasets at a global scale usually suffer from non-stationarity and
non-uniformly smooth spatial boundaries. A Gaussian process regression using a
non-stationary covariance function has shown promise for this task, as this
covariance function adapts to the variable correlation structure of the
underlying distribution. In this paper, we generalize the non-stationary
covariance function to address the aforementioned global scale geospatial
issues. We define this generalized covariance function as an intrinsic
non-stationary covariance function, because it uses intrinsic statistics of the
symmetric positive definite matrices to represent the characteristic length
scale and, thereby, models the local stochastic process. Experiments on a
synthetic and real dataset of relative sea level changes across the world
demonstrate improvements in the error metrics for the regression estimates
using our newly proposed approach.
