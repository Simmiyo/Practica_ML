Rethinking Collapsed Variational Bayes Inference for LDA
We propose a novel interpretation of the collapsed variational Bayes
inference with a zero-order Taylor expansion approximation, called CVB0
inference, for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). We clarify the properties of
the CVB0 inference by using the alpha-divergence. We show that the CVB0
inference is composed of two different divergence projections: alpha=1 and -1.
This interpretation will help shed light on CVB0 works.
