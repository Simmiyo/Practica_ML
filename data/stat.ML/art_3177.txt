Using Riemannian geometry for SSVEP-based Brain Computer Interface
Riemannian geometry has been applied to Brain Computer Interface (BCI) for
brain signals classification yielding promising results. Studying
electroencephalographic (EEG) signals from their associated covariance matrices
allows a mitigation of common sources of variability (electronic, electrical,
biological) by constructing a representation which is invariant to these
perturbations. While working in Euclidean space with covariance matrices is
known to be error-prone, one might take advantage of algorithmic advances in
information geometry and matrix manifold to implement methods for Symmetric
Positive-Definite (SPD) matrices. This paper proposes a comprehensive review of
the actual tools of information geometry and how they could be applied on
covariance matrices of EEG. In practice, covariance matrices should be
estimated, thus a thorough study of all estimators is conducted on real EEG
dataset. As a main contribution, this paper proposes an online implementation
of a classifier in the Riemannian space and its subsequent assessment in
Steady-State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP) experimentations.
