Directional Statistics on Permutations
Distributions over permutations arise in applications ranging from
multi-object tracking to ranking of instances. The difficulty of dealing with
these distributions is caused by the size of their domain, which is factorial
in the number of considered entities ($n!$). It makes the direct definition of
a multinomial distribution over permutation space impractical for all but a
very small $n$. In this work we propose an embedding of all $n!$ permutations
for a given $n$ in a surface of a hypersphere defined in
$\mathbbm{R}^{(n-1)^2}$. As a result of the embedding, we acquire ability to
define continuous distributions over a hypersphere with all the benefits of
directional statistics. We provide polynomial time projections between the
continuous hypersphere representation and the $n!$-element permutation space.
The framework provides a way to use continuous directional probability
densities and the methods developed thereof for establishing densities over
permutations. As a demonstration of the benefits of the framework we derive an
inference procedure for a state-space model over permutations. We demonstrate
the approach with applications.
