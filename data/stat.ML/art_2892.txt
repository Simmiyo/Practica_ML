Distributed Stochastic Optimization of the Regularized Risk
Many machine learning algorithms minimize a regularized risk, and stochastic
optimization is widely used for this task. When working with massive data, it
is desirable to perform stochastic optimization in parallel. Unfortunately,
many existing stochastic optimization algorithms cannot be parallelized
efficiently. In this paper we show that one can rewrite the regularized risk
minimization problem as an equivalent saddle-point problem, and propose an
efficient distributed stochastic optimization (DSO) algorithm. We prove the
algorithm's rate of convergence; remarkably, our analysis shows that the
algorithm scales almost linearly with the number of processors. We also verify
with empirical evaluations that the proposed algorithm is competitive with
other parallel, general purpose stochastic and batch optimization algorithms
for regularized risk minimization.
