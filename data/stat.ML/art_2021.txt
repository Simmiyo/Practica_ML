Learning Convex Inference of Marginals
Graphical models trained using maximum likelihood are a common tool for
probabilistic inference of marginal distributions. However, this approach
suffers difficulties when either the inference process or the model is
approximate. In this paper, the inference process is first defined to be the
minimization of a convex function, inspired by free energy approximations.
Learning is then done directly in terms of the performance of the inference
process at univariate marginal prediction. The main novelty is that this is a
direct minimization of emperical risk, where the risk measures the accuracy of
predicted marginals.
