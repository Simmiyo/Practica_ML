A Methodology for the Diagnostic of Aircraft Engine Based on Indicators
  Aggregation
Aircraft engine manufacturers collect large amount of engine related data
during flights. These data are used to detect anomalies in the engines in order
to help companies optimize their maintenance costs. This article introduces and
studies a generic methodology that allows one to build automatic early signs of
anomaly detection in a way that is understandable by human operators who make
the final maintenance decision. The main idea of the method is to generate a
very large number of binary indicators based on parametric anomaly scores
designed by experts, complemented by simple aggregations of those scores. The
best indicators are selected via a classical forward scheme, leading to a much
reduced number of indicators that are tuned to a data set. We illustrate the
interest of the method on simulated data which contain realistic early signs of
anomalies.
