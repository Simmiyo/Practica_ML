On Finding the Largest Mean Among Many
Sampling from distributions to find the one with the largest mean arises in a
broad range of applications, and it can be mathematically modeled as a
multi-armed bandit problem in which each distribution is associated with an
arm. This paper studies the sample complexity of identifying the best arm
(largest mean) in a multi-armed bandit problem. Motivated by large-scale
applications, we are especially interested in identifying situations where the
total number of samples that are necessary and sufficient to find the best arm
scale linearly with the number of arms. We present a single-parameter
multi-armed bandit model that spans the range from linear to superlinear sample
complexity. We also give a new algorithm for best arm identification, called
PRISM, with linear sample complexity for a wide range of mean distributions.
The algorithm, like most exploration procedures for multi-armed bandits, is
adaptive in the sense that the next arms to sample are selected based on
previous samples. We compare the sample complexity of adaptive procedures with
simpler non-adaptive procedures using new lower bounds. For many problem
instances, the increased sample complexity required by non-adaptive procedures
is a polynomial factor of the number of arms.
