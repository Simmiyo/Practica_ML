Markov Blanket Ranking using Kernel-based Conditional Dependence
  Measures
Developing feature selection algorithms that move beyond a pure correlational
to a more causal analysis of observational data is an important problem in the
sciences. Several algorithms attempt to do so by discovering the Markov blanket
of a target, but they all contain a forward selection step which variables must
pass in order to be included in the conditioning set. As a result, these
algorithms may not consider all possible conditional multivariate combinations.
We improve on this limitation by proposing a backward elimination method that
uses a kernel-based conditional dependence measure to identify the Markov
blanket in a fully multivariate fashion. The algorithm is easy to implement and
compares favorably to other methods on synthetic and real datasets.
