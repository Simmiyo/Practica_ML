Scaling up the Automatic Statistician: Scalable Structure Discovery
  using Gaussian Processes
Automating statistical modelling is a challenging problem in artificial
intelligence. The Automatic Statistician takes a first step in this direction,
by employing a kernel search algorithm with Gaussian Processes (GP) to provide
interpretable statistical models for regression problems. However this does not
scale due to its $O(N^3)$ running time for the model selection. We propose
Scalable Kernel Composition (SKC), a scalable kernel search algorithm that
extends the Automatic Statistician to bigger data sets. In doing so, we derive
a cheap upper bound on the GP marginal likelihood that sandwiches the marginal
likelihood with the variational lower bound . We show that the upper bound is
significantly tighter than the lower bound and thus useful for model selection.
