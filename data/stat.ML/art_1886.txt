Identifiability of Causal Graphs using Functional Models
This work addresses the following question: Under what assumptions on the
data generating process can one infer the causal graph from the joint
distribution? The approach taken by conditional independence-based causal
discovery methods is based on two assumptions: the Markov condition and
faithfulness. It has been shown that under these assumptions the causal graph
can be identified up to Markov equivalence (some arrows remain undirected)
using methods like the PC algorithm. In this work we propose an alternative by
defining Identifiable Functional Model Classes (IFMOCs). As our main theorem we
prove that if the data generating process belongs to an IFMOC, one can identify
the complete causal graph. To the best of our knowledge this is the first
identifiability result of this kind that is not limited to linear functional
relationships. We discuss how the IFMOC assumption and the Markov and
faithfulness assumptions relate to each other and explain why we believe that
the IFMOC assumption can be tested more easily on given data. We further
provide a practical algorithm that recovers the causal graph from finitely many
data; experiments on simulated data support the theoretical findings.
