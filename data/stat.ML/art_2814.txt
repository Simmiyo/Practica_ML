Cascading Randomized Weighted Majority: A New Online Ensemble Learning
  Algorithm
With the increasing volume of data in the world, the best approach for
learning from this data is to exploit an online learning algorithm. Online
ensemble methods are online algorithms which take advantage of an ensemble of
classifiers to predict labels of data. Prediction with expert advice is a
well-studied problem in the online ensemble learning literature. The Weighted
Majority algorithm and the randomized weighted majority (RWM) are the most
well-known solutions to this problem, aiming to converge to the best expert.
Since among some expert, the best one does not necessarily have the minimum
error in all regions of data space, defining specific regions and converging to
the best expert in each of these regions will lead to a better result. In this
paper, we aim to resolve this defect of RWM algorithms by proposing a novel
online ensemble algorithm to the problem of prediction with expert advice. We
propose a cascading version of RWM to achieve not only better experimental
results but also a better error bound for sufficiently large datasets.
