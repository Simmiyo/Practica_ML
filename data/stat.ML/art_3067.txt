Validation of Matching
We introduce a technique to compute probably approximately correct (PAC)
bounds on precision and recall for matching algorithms. The bounds require some
verified matches, but those matches may be used to develop the algorithms. The
bounds can be applied to network reconciliation or entity resolution
algorithms, which identify nodes in different networks or values in a data set
that correspond to the same entity. For network reconciliation, the bounds do
not require knowledge of the network generation process.
