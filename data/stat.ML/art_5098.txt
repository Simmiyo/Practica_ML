Environmental Modeling Framework using Stacked Gaussian Processes
A network of independently trained Gaussian processes (StackedGP) is
introduced to obtain predictions of quantities of interest with quantified
uncertainties. The main applications of the StackedGP framework are to
integrate different datasets through model composition, enhance predictions of
quantities of interest through a cascade of intermediate predictions, and to
propagate uncertainties through emulated dynamical systems driven by uncertain
forcing variables. By using analytical first and second-order moments of a
Gaussian process with uncertain inputs using squared exponential and polynomial
kernels, approximated expectations of quantities of interests that require an
arbitrary composition of functions can be obtained. The StackedGP model is
extended to any number of layers and nodes per layer, and it provides
flexibility in kernel selection for the input nodes. The proposed nonparametric
stacked model is validated using synthetic datasets, and its performance in
model composition and cascading predictions is measured in two applications
using real data.
