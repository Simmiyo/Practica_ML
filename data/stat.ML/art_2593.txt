Compound Poisson Processes, Latent Shrinkage Priors and Bayesian
  Nonconvex Penalization
In this paper we discuss Bayesian nonconvex penalization for sparse learning
problems. We explore a nonparametric formulation for latent shrinkage
parameters using subordinators which are one-dimensional L\'{e}vy processes. We
particularly study a family of continuous compound Poisson subordinators and a
family of discrete compound Poisson subordinators. We exemplify four specific
subordinators: Gamma, Poisson, negative binomial and squared Bessel
subordinators. The Laplace exponents of the subordinators are Bernstein
functions, so they can be used as sparsity-inducing nonconvex penalty
functions. We exploit these subordinators in regression problems, yielding a
hierarchical model with multiple regularization parameters. We devise ECME
(Expectation/Conditional Maximization Either) algorithms to simultaneously
estimate regression coefficients and regularization parameters. The empirical
evaluation of simulated data shows that our approach is feasible and effective
in high-dimensional data analysis.
