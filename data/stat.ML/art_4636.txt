Condorcet's Jury Theorem for Consensus Clustering and its Implications
  for Diversity
Condorcet's Jury Theorem has been invoked for ensemble classifiers to
indicate that the combination of many classifiers can have better predictive
performance than a single classifier. Such a theoretical underpinning is
unknown for consensus clustering. This article extends Condorcet's Jury Theorem
to the mean partition approach under the additional assumptions that a unique
ground-truth partition exists and sample partitions are drawn from a
sufficiently small ball containing the ground-truth. As an implication of
practical relevance, we question the claim that the quality of consensus
clustering depends on the diversity of the sample partitions. Instead, we
conjecture that limiting the diversity of the mean partitions is necessary for
controlling the quality.
