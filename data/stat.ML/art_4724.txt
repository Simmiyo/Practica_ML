TripleSpin - a generic compact paradigm for fast machine learning
  computations
We present a generic compact computational framework relying on structured
random matrices that can be applied to speed up several machine learning
algorithms with almost no loss of accuracy. The applications include new fast
LSH-based algorithms, efficient kernel computations via random feature maps,
convex optimization algorithms, quantization techniques and many more. Certain
models of the presented paradigm are even more compressible since they apply
only bit matrices. This makes them suitable for deploying on mobile devices.
All our findings come with strong theoretical guarantees. In particular, as a
byproduct of the presented techniques and by using relatively new
Berry-Esseen-type CLT for random vectors, we give the first theoretical
guarantees for one of the most efficient existing LSH algorithms based on the
$\textbf{HD}_{3}\textbf{HD}_{2}\textbf{HD}_{1}$ structured matrix ("Practical
and Optimal LSH for Angular Distance"). These guarantees as well as theoretical
results for other aforementioned applications follow from the same general
theoretical principle that we present in the paper. Our structured family
contains as special cases all previously considered structured schemes,
including the recently introduced $P$-model. Experimental evaluation confirms
the accuracy and efficiency of TripleSpin matrices.
