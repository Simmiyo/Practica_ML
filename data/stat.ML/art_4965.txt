Learning Temporal Dependence from Time-Series Data with Latent Variables
We consider the setting where a collection of time series, modeled as random
processes, evolve in a causal manner, and one is interested in learning the
graph governing the relationships of these processes. A special case of wide
interest and applicability is the setting where the noise is Gaussian and
relationships are Markov and linear. We study this setting with two additional
features: firstly, each random process has a hidden (latent) state, which we
use to model the internal memory possessed by the variables (similar to hidden
Markov models). Secondly, each variable can depend on its latent memory state
through a random lag (rather than a fixed lag), thus modeling memory recall
with differing lags at distinct times. Under this setting, we develop an
estimator and prove that under a genericity assumption, the parameters of the
model can be learned consistently. We also propose a practical adaption of this
estimator, which demonstrates significant performance gains in both synthetic
and real-world datasets.
