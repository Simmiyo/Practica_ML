Approximate Inference for Nonstationary Heteroscedastic Gaussian process
  Regression
This paper presents a novel approach for approximate integration over the
uncertainty of noise and signal variances in Gaussian process (GP) regression.
Our efficient and straightforward approach can also be applied to integration
over input dependent noise variance (heteroscedasticity) and input dependent
signal variance (nonstationarity) by setting independent GP priors for the
noise and signal variances. We use expectation propagation (EP) for inference
and compare results to Markov chain Monte Carlo in two simulated data sets and
three empirical examples. The results show that EP produces comparable results
with less computational burden.
