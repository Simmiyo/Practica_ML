Bayesian Agglomerative Clustering with Coalescents
We introduce a new Bayesian model for hierarchical clustering based on a
prior over trees called Kingman's coalescent. We develop novel greedy and
sequential Monte Carlo inferences which operate in a bottom-up agglomerative
fashion. We show experimentally the superiority of our algorithms over others,
and demonstrate our approach in document clustering and phylolinguistics.
