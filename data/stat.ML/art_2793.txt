Dropout Rademacher Complexity of Deep Neural Networks
Great successes of deep neural networks have been witnessed in various real
applications. Many algorithmic and implementation techniques have been
developed, however, theoretical understanding of many aspects of deep neural
networks is far from clear. A particular interesting issue is the usefulness of
dropout, which was motivated from the intuition of preventing complex
co-adaptation of feature detectors. In this paper, we study the Rademacher
complexity of different types of dropout, and our theoretical results disclose
that for shallow neural networks (with one or none hidden layer) dropout is
able to reduce the Rademacher complexity in polynomial, whereas for deep neural
networks it can amazingly lead to an exponential reduction of the Rademacher
complexity.
