Spike-and-Slab Sparse Coding for Unsupervised Feature Discovery
We consider the problem of using a factor model we call {\em spike-and-slab
sparse coding} (S3C) to learn features for a classification task. The S3C model
resembles both the spike-and-slab RBM and sparse coding. Since exact inference
in this model is intractable, we derive a structured variational inference
procedure and employ a variational EM training algorithm. Prior work on
approximate inference for this model has not prioritized the ability to exploit
parallel architectures and scale to enormous problem sizes. We present an
inference procedure appropriate for use with GPUs which allows us to
dramatically increase both the training set size and the amount of latent
factors.
  We demonstrate that this approach improves upon the supervised learning
capabilities of both sparse coding and the ssRBM on the CIFAR-10 dataset. We
evaluate our approach's potential for semi-supervised learning on subsets of
CIFAR-10. We demonstrate state-of-the art self-taught learning performance on
the STL-10 dataset and use our method to win the NIPS 2011 Workshop on
Challenges In Learning Hierarchical Models' Transfer Learning Challenge.
