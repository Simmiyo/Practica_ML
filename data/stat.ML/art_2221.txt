Changepoint detection for high-dimensional time series with missing data
This paper describes a novel approach to change-point detection when the
observed high-dimensional data may have missing elements. The performance of
classical methods for change-point detection typically scales poorly with the
dimensionality of the data, so that a large number of observations are
collected after the true change-point before it can be reliably detected.
Furthermore, missing components in the observed data handicap conventional
approaches. The proposed method addresses these challenges by modeling the
dynamic distribution underlying the data as lying close to a time-varying
low-dimensional submanifold embedded within the ambient observation space.
Specifically, streaming data is used to track a submanifold approximation,
measure deviations from this approximation, and calculate a series of
statistics of the deviations for detecting when the underlying manifold has
changed in a sharp or unexpected manner. The approach described in this paper
leverages several recent results in the field of high-dimensional data
analysis, including subspace tracking with missing data, multiscale analysis
techniques for point clouds, online optimization, and change-point detection
performance analysis. Simulations and experiments highlight the robustness and
efficacy of the proposed approach in detecting an abrupt change in an otherwise
slowly varying low-dimensional manifold.
