Performance Limits of Dictionary Learning for Sparse Coding
We consider the problem of dictionary learning under the assumption that the
observed signals can be represented as sparse linear combinations of the
columns of a single large dictionary matrix. In particular, we analyze the
minimax risk of the dictionary learning problem which governs the mean squared
error (MSE) performance of any learning scheme, regardless of its computational
complexity. By following an established information-theoretic method based on
Fanos inequality, we derive a lower bound on the minimax risk for a given
dictionary learning problem. This lower bound yields a characterization of the
sample-complexity, i.e., a lower bound on the required number of observations
such that consistent dictionary learning schemes exist. Our bounds may be
compared with the performance of a given learning scheme, allowing to
characterize how far the method is from optimal performance.
