Matrix Coherence and the Nystrom Method
The Nystrom method is an efficient technique used to speed up large-scale
learning applications by generating low-rank approximations. Crucial to the
performance of this technique is the assumption that a matrix can be well
approximated by working exclusively with a subset of its columns. In this work
we relate this assumption to the concept of matrix coherence, connecting
coherence to the performance of the Nystrom method. Making use of related work
in the compressed sensing and the matrix completion literature, we derive novel
coherence-based bounds for the Nystrom method in the low-rank setting. We then
present empirical results that corroborate these theoretical bounds. Finally,
we present more general empirical results for the full-rank setting that
convincingly demonstrate the ability of matrix coherence to measure the degree
to which information can be extracted from a subset of columns.
