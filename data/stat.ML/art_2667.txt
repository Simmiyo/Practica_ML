Safe and Efficient Screening For Sparse Support Vector Machine
Screening is an effective technique for speeding up the training process of a
sparse learning model by removing the features that are guaranteed to be
inactive the process. In this paper, we present a efficient screening technique
for sparse support vector machine based on variational inequality. The
technique is both efficient and safe.
