Missing Data Imputation for Supervised Learning
Missing data imputation can help improve the performance of prediction models
in situations where missing data hide useful information. This paper compares
methods for imputing missing categorical data for supervised classification
tasks. We experiment on two machine learning benchmark datasets with missing
categorical data, comparing classifiers trained on non-imputed (i.e., one-hot
encoded) or imputed data with different levels of additional missing-data
perturbation. We show imputation methods can increase predictive accuracy in
the presence of missing-data perturbation, which can actually improve
prediction accuracy by regularizing the classifier. We achieve the
state-of-the-art on the Adult dataset with missing-data perturbation and
k-nearest-neighbors (k-NN) imputation.
