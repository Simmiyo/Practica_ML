Spectral dimensionality reduction for HMMs
Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) can be accurately approximated using
co-occurrence frequencies of pairs and triples of observations by using a fast
spectral method in contrast to the usual slow methods like EM or Gibbs
sampling. We provide a new spectral method which significantly reduces the
number of model parameters that need to be estimated, and generates a sample
complexity that does not depend on the size of the observation vocabulary. We
present an elementary proof giving bounds on the relative accuracy of
probability estimates from our model. (Correlaries show our bounds can be
weakened to provide either L1 bounds or KL bounds which provide easier direct
comparisons to previous work.) Our theorem uses conditions that are checkable
from the data, instead of putting conditions on the unobservable Markov
transition matrix.
