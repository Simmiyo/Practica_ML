Sample Complexity of Multi-task Reinforcement Learning
Transferring knowledge across a sequence of reinforcement-learning tasks is
challenging, and has a number of important applications. Though there is
encouraging empirical evidence that transfer can improve performance in
subsequent reinforcement-learning tasks, there has been very little theoretical
analysis. In this paper, we introduce a new multi-task algorithm for a sequence
of reinforcement-learning tasks when each task is sampled independently from
(an unknown) distribution over a finite set of Markov decision processes whose
parameters are initially unknown. For this setting, we prove under certain
assumptions that the per-task sample complexity of exploration is reduced
significantly due to transfer compared to standard single-task algorithms. Our
multi-task algorithm also has the desired characteristic that it is guaranteed
not to exhibit negative transfer: in the worst case its per-task sample
complexity is comparable to the corresponding single-task algorithm.
