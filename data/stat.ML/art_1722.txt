Constrained Mixture Models for Asset Returns Modelling
The estimation of asset return distributions is crucial for determining
optimal trading strategies. In this paper we describe the constrained mixture
model, based on a mixture of Gamma and Gaussian distributions, to provide an
accurate description of price trends as being clearly positive, negative or
ranging while accounting for heavy tails and high kurtosis. The model is
estimated in the Expectation Maximisation framework and model order estimation
also respects the model's constraints.
