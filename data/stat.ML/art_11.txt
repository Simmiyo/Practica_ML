Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection
Changepoints are abrupt variations in the generative parameters of a data
sequence. Online detection of changepoints is useful in modelling and
prediction of time series in application areas such as finance, biometrics, and
robotics. While frequentist methods have yielded online filtering and
prediction techniques, most Bayesian papers have focused on the retrospective
segmentation problem. Here we examine the case where the model parameters
before and after the changepoint are independent and we derive an online
algorithm for exact inference of the most recent changepoint. We compute the
probability distribution of the length of the current ``run,'' or time since
the last changepoint, using a simple message-passing algorithm. Our
implementation is highly modular so that the algorithm may be applied to a
variety of types of data. We illustrate this modularity by demonstrating the
algorithm on three different real-world data sets.
