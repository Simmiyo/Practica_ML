On The Construction of Extreme Learning Machine for Online and Offline
  One-Class Classification - An Expanded Toolbox
One-Class Classification (OCC) has been prime concern for researchers and
effectively employed in various disciplines. But, traditional methods based
one-class classifiers are very time consuming due to its iterative process and
various parameters tuning. In this paper, we present six OCC methods based on
extreme learning machine (ELM) and Online Sequential ELM (OSELM). Our proposed
classifiers mainly lie in two categories: reconstruction based and boundary
based, which supports both types of learning viz., online and offline learning.
Out of various proposed methods, four are offline and remaining two are online
methods. Out of four offline methods, two methods perform random feature
mapping and two methods perform kernel feature mapping. Kernel feature mapping
based approaches have been tested with RBF kernel and online version of
one-class classifiers are tested with both types of nodes viz., additive and
RBF. It is well known fact that threshold decision is a crucial factor in case
of OCC, so, three different threshold deciding criteria have been employed so
far and analyses the effectiveness of one threshold deciding criteria over
another. Further, these methods are tested on two artificial datasets to check
there boundary construction capability and on eight benchmark datasets from
different discipline to evaluate the performance of the classifiers. Our
proposed classifiers exhibit better performance compared to ten traditional
one-class classifiers and ELM based two one-class classifiers. Through proposed
one-class classifiers, we intend to expand the functionality of the most used
toolbox for OCC i.e. DD toolbox. All of our methods are totally compatible with
all the present features of the toolbox.
