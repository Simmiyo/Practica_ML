Visualizing Topics with Multi-Word Expressions
We describe a new method for visualizing topics, the distributions over terms
that are automatically extracted from large text corpora using latent variable
models. Our method finds significant $n$-grams related to a topic, which are
then used to help understand and interpret the underlying distribution.
Compared with the usual visualization, which simply lists the most probable
topical terms, the multi-word expressions provide a better intuitive impression
for what a topic is "about." Our approach is based on a language model of
arbitrary length expressions, for which we develop a new methodology based on
nested permutation tests to find significant phrases. We show that this method
outperforms the more standard use of $\chi^2$ and likelihood ratio tests. We
illustrate the topic presentations on corpora of scientific abstracts and news
articles.
