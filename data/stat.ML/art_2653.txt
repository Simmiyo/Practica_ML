On the Bayes-optimality of F-measure maximizers
The F-measure, which has originally been introduced in information retrieval,
is nowadays routinely used as a performance metric for problems such as binary
classification, multi-label classification, and structured output prediction.
Optimizing this measure is a statistically and computationally challenging
problem, since no closed-form solution exists. Adopting a decision-theoretic
perspective, this article provides a formal and experimental analysis of
different approaches for maximizing the F-measure. We start with a Bayes-risk
analysis of related loss functions, such as Hamming loss and subset zero-one
loss, showing that optimizing such losses as a surrogate of the F-measure leads
to a high worst-case regret. Subsequently, we perform a similar type of
analysis for F-measure maximizing algorithms, showing that such algorithms are
approximate, while relying on additional assumptions regarding the statistical
distribution of the binary response variables. Furthermore, we present a new
algorithm which is not only computationally efficient but also Bayes-optimal,
regardless of the underlying distribution. To this end, the algorithm requires
only a quadratic (with respect to the number of binary responses) number of
parameters of the joint distribution. We illustrate the practical performance
of all analyzed methods by means of experiments with multi-label classification
problems.
