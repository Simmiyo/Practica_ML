Maximum Entropy Discrimination Markov Networks
In this paper, we present a novel and general framework called {\it Maximum
Entropy Discrimination Markov Networks} (MaxEnDNet), which integrates the
max-margin structured learning and Bayesian-style estimation and combines and
extends their merits. Major innovations of this model include: 1) It
generalizes the extant Markov network prediction rule based on a point
estimator of weights to a Bayesian-style estimator that integrates over a
learned distribution of the weights. 2) It extends the conventional max-entropy
discrimination learning of classification rule to a new structural max-entropy
discrimination paradigm of learning the distribution of Markov networks. 3) It
subsumes the well-known and powerful Maximum Margin Markov network (M$^3$N) as
a special case, and leads to a model similar to an $L_1$-regularized M$^3$N
that is simultaneously primal and dual sparse, or other types of Markov network
by plugging in different prior distributions of the weights. 4) It offers a
simple inference algorithm that combines existing variational inference and
convex-optimization based M$^3$N solvers as subroutines. 5) It offers a
PAC-Bayesian style generalization bound. This work represents the first
successful attempt to combine Bayesian-style learning (based on generative
models) with structured maximum margin learning (based on a discriminative
model), and outperforms a wide array of competing methods for structured
input/output learning on both synthetic and real data sets.
