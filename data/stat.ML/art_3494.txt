The Mondrian Process for Machine Learning
This report is concerned with the Mondrian process and its applications in
machine learning. The Mondrian process is a guillotine-partition-valued
stochastic process that possesses an elegant self-consistency property. The
first part of the report uses simple concepts from applied probability to
define the Mondrian process and explore its properties.
  The Mondrian process has been used as the main building block of a clever
online random forest classification algorithm that turns out to be equivalent
to its batch counterpart. We outline a slight adaptation of this algorithm to
regression, as the remainder of the report uses regression as a case study of
how Mondrian processes can be utilized in machine learning. In particular, the
Mondrian process will be used to construct a fast approximation to the
computationally expensive kernel ridge regression problem with a Laplace
kernel.
  The complexity of random guillotine partitions generated by a Mondrian
process and hence the complexity of the resulting regression models is
controlled by a lifetime hyperparameter. It turns out that these models can be
efficiently trained and evaluated for all lifetimes in a given range at once,
without needing to retrain them from scratch for each lifetime value. This
leads to an efficient procedure for determining the right model complexity for
a dataset at hand.
  The limitation of having a single lifetime hyperparameter will motivate the
final Mondrian grid model, in which each input dimension is endowed with its
own lifetime parameter. In this model we preserve the property that its
hyperparameters can be tweaked without needing to retrain the modified model
from scratch.
