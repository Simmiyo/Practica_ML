SpicyMKL
We propose a new optimization algorithm for Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL)
called SpicyMKL, which is applicable to general convex loss functions and
general types of regularization. The proposed SpicyMKL iteratively solves
smooth minimization problems. Thus, there is no need of solving SVM, LP, or QP
internally. SpicyMKL can be viewed as a proximal minimization method and
converges super-linearly. The cost of inner minimization is roughly
proportional to the number of active kernels. Therefore, when we aim for a
sparse kernel combination, our algorithm scales well against increasing number
of kernels. Moreover, we give a general block-norm formulation of MKL that
includes non-sparse regularizations, such as elastic-net and \ellp -norm
regularizations. Extending SpicyMKL, we propose an efficient optimization
method for the general regularization framework. Experimental results show that
our algorithm is faster than existing methods especially when the number of
kernels is large (> 1000).
