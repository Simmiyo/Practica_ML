A comparison of linear and non-linear calibrations for speaker
  recognition
In recent work on both generative and discriminative score to
log-likelihood-ratio calibration, it was shown that linear transforms give good
accuracy only for a limited range of operating points. Moreover, these methods
required tailoring of the calibration training objective functions in order to
target the desired region of best accuracy. Here, we generalize the linear
recipes to non-linear ones. We experiment with a non-linear, non-parametric,
discriminative PAV solution, as well as parametric, generative,
maximum-likelihood solutions that use Gaussian, Student's T and
normal-inverse-Gaussian score distributions. Experiments on NIST SRE'12 scores
suggest that the non-linear methods provide wider ranges of optimal accuracy
and can be trained without having to resort to objective function tailoring.
