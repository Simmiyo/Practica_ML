Gaussian Copula Variational Autoencoders for Mixed Data
The variational autoencoder (VAE) is a generative model with continuous
latent variables where a pair of probabilistic encoder (bottom-up) and decoder
(top-down) is jointly learned by stochastic gradient variational Bayes. We
first elaborate Gaussian VAE, approximating the local covariance matrix of the
decoder as an outer product of the principal direction at a position determined
by a sample drawn from Gaussian distribution. We show that this model, referred
to as VAE-ROC, better captures the data manifold, compared to the standard
Gaussian VAE where independent multivariate Gaussian was used to model the
decoder. Then we extend the VAE-ROC to handle mixed categorical and continuous
data. To this end, we employ Gaussian copula to model the local dependency in
mixed categorical and continuous data, leading to {\em Gaussian copula
variational autoencoder} (GCVAE). As in VAE-ROC, we use the rank-one
approximation for the covariance in the Gaussian copula, to capture the local
dependency structure in the mixed data. Experiments on various datasets
demonstrate the useful behaviour of VAE-ROC and GCVAE, compared to the standard
VAE.
