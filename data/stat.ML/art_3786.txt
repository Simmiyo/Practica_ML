Optimal Inference in Crowdsourced Classification via Belief Propagation
Crowdsourcing systems are popular for solving large-scale labelling tasks
with low-paid workers. We study the problem of recovering the true labels from
the possibly erroneous crowdsourced labels under the popular Dawid-Skene model.
To address this inference problem, several algorithms have recently been
proposed, but the best known guarantee is still significantly larger than the
fundamental limit. We close this gap by introducing a tighter lower bound on
the fundamental limit and proving that Belief Propagation (BP) exactly matches
this lower bound. The guaranteed optimality of BP is the strongest in the sense
that it is information-theoretically impossible for any other algorithm to
correctly label a larger fraction of the tasks. Experimental results suggest
that BP is close to optimal for all regimes considered and improves upon
competing state-of-the-art algorithms.
