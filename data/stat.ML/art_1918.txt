Gaussian Process Topic Models
We introduce Gaussian Process Topic Models (GPTMs), a new family of topic
models which can leverage a kernel among documents while extracting correlated
topics. GPTMs can be considered a systematic generalization of the Correlated
Topic Models (CTMs) using ideas from Gaussian Process (GP) based embedding.
Since GPTMs work with both a topic covariance matrix and a document kernel
matrix, learning GPTMs involves a novel component-solving a suitable Sylvester
equation capturing both topic and document dependencies. The efficacy of GPTMs
is demonstrated with experiments evaluating the quality of both topic modeling
and embedding.
