Lifted Tree-Reweighted Variational Inference
We analyze variational inference for highly symmetric graphical models such
as those arising from first-order probabilistic models. We first show that for
these graphical models, the tree-reweighted variational objective lends itself
to a compact lifted formulation which can be solved much more efficiently than
the standard TRW formulation for the ground graphical model. Compared to
earlier work on lifted belief propagation, our formulation leads to a convex
optimization problem for lifted marginal inference and provides an upper bound
on the partition function. We provide two approaches for improving the lifted
TRW upper bound. The first is a method for efficiently computing maximum
spanning trees in highly symmetric graphs, which can be used to optimize the
TRW edge appearance probabilities. The second is a method for tightening the
relaxation of the marginal polytope using lifted cycle inequalities and novel
exchangeable cluster consistency constraints.
