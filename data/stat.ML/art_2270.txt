Sample-efficient Nonstationary Policy Evaluation for Contextual Bandits
We present and prove properties of a new offline policy evaluator for an
exploration learning setting which is superior to previous evaluators. In
particular, it simultaneously and correctly incorporates techniques from
importance weighting, doubly robust evaluation, and nonstationary policy
evaluation approaches. In addition, our approach allows generating longer
histories by careful control of a bias-variance tradeoff, and further decreases
variance by incorporating information about randomness of the target policy.
Empirical evidence from synthetic and realworld exploration learning problems
shows the new evaluator successfully unifies previous approaches and uses
information an order of magnitude more efficiently.
