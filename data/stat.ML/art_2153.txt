Predicting Conditional Quantiles via Reduction to Classification
We show how to reduce the process of predicting general order statistics (and
the median in particular) to solving classification. The accompanying
theoretical statement shows that the regret of the classifier bounds the regret
of the quantile regression under a quantile loss. We also test this reduction
empirically against existing quantile regression methods on large real-world
datasets and discover that it provides state-of-the-art performance.
