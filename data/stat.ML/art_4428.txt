Learning with Biased Complementary Labels
In this paper, we study the classification problem in which we have access to
easily obtainable surrogate for true labels, namely complementary labels, which
specify classes that observations do \textbf{not} belong to. Let $Y$ and
$\bar{Y}$ be the true and complementary labels, respectively. We first model
the annotation of complementary labels via transition probabilities
$P(\bar{Y}=i|Y=j), i\neq j\in\{1,\cdots,c\}$, where $c$ is the number of
classes. Previous methods implicitly assume that $P(\bar{Y}=i|Y=j), \forall
i\neq j$, are identical, which is not true in practice because humans are
biased toward their own experience. For example, as shown in Figure 1, if an
annotator is more familiar with monkeys than prairie dogs when providing
complementary labels for meerkats, she is more likely to employ "monkey" as a
complementary label. We therefore reason that the transition probabilities will
be different. In this paper, we propose a framework that contributes three main
innovations to learning with \textbf{biased} complementary labels: (1) It
estimates transition probabilities with no bias. (2) It provides a general
method to modify traditional loss functions and extends standard deep neural
network classifiers to learn with biased complementary labels. (3) It
theoretically ensures that the classifier learned with complementary labels
converges to the optimal one learned with true labels. Comprehensive
experiments on several benchmark datasets validate the superiority of our
method to current state-of-the-art methods.
