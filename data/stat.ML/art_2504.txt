Characterizing A Database of Sequential Behaviors with Latent Dirichlet
  Hidden Markov Models
This paper proposes a generative model, the latent Dirichlet hidden Markov
models (LDHMM), for characterizing a database of sequential behaviors
(sequences). LDHMMs posit that each sequence is generated by an underlying
Markov chain process, which are controlled by the corresponding parameters
(i.e., the initial state vector, transition matrix and the emission matrix).
These sequence-level latent parameters for each sequence are modeled as latent
Dirichlet random variables and parameterized by a set of deterministic
database-level hyper-parameters. Through this way, we expect to model the
sequence in two levels: the database level by deterministic hyper-parameters
and the sequence-level by latent parameters. To learn the deterministic
hyper-parameters and approximate posteriors of parameters in LDHMMs, we propose
an iterative algorithm under the variational EM framework, which consists of E
and M steps. We examine two different schemes, the fully-factorized and
partially-factorized forms, for the framework, based on different assumptions.
We present empirical results of behavior modeling and sequence classification
on three real-world data sets, and compare them to other related models. The
experimental results prove that the proposed LDHMMs produce better
generalization performance in terms of log-likelihood and deliver competitive
results on the sequence classification problem.
