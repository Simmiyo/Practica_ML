Similarity-Driven Cluster Merging Method for Unsupervised Fuzzy
  Clustering
In this paper, a similarity-driven cluster merging method is proposed for
unsuper-vised fuzzy clustering. The cluster merging method is used to resolve
the problem of cluster validation. Starting with an overspecified number of
clusters in the data, pairs of similar clusters are merged based on the
proposed similarity-driven cluster merging criterion. The similarity between
clusters is calculated by a fuzzy cluster similarity matrix, while an adaptive
threshold is used for merging. In addition, a modified generalized ob- jective
function is used for prototype-based fuzzy clustering. The function includes
the p-norm distance measure as well as principal components of the clusters.
The number of the principal components is determined automatically from the
data being clustered. The properties of this unsupervised fuzzy clustering
algorithm are illustrated by several experiments.
