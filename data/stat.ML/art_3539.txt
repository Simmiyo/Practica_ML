BLC: Private Matrix Factorization Recommenders via Automatic Group
  Learning
We propose a privacy-enhanced matrix factorization recommender that exploits
the fact that users can often be grouped together by interest. This allows a
form of "hiding in the crowd" privacy. We introduce a novel matrix
factorization approach suited to making recommendations in a shared group (or
nym) setting and the BLC algorithm for carrying out this matrix factorization
in a privacy-enhanced manner. We demonstrate that the increased privacy does
not come at the cost of reduced recommendation accuracy.
