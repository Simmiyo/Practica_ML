Distributed Robust Learning
We propose a framework for distributed robust statistical learning on {\em
big contaminated data}. The Distributed Robust Learning (DRL) framework can
reduce the computational time of traditional robust learning methods by several
orders of magnitude. We analyze the robustness property of DRL, showing that
DRL not only preserves the robustness of the base robust learning method, but
also tolerates contaminations on a constant fraction of results from computing
nodes (node failures). More precisely, even in presence of the most adversarial
outlier distribution over computing nodes, DRL still achieves a breakdown point
of at least $ \lambda^*/2 $, where $ \lambda^* $ is the break down point of
corresponding centralized algorithm. This is in stark contrast with naive
division-and-averaging implementation, which may reduce the breakdown point by
a factor of $ k $ when $ k $ computing nodes are used. We then specialize the
DRL framework for two concrete cases: distributed robust principal component
analysis and distributed robust regression. We demonstrate the efficiency and
the robustness advantages of DRL through comprehensive simulations and
predicting image tags on a large-scale image set.
