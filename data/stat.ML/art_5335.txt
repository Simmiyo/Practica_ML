Semi-parametric Network Structure Discovery Models
We propose a network structure discovery model for continuous observations
that generalizes linear causal models by incorporating a Gaussian process (GP)
prior on a network-independent component, and random sparsity and weight
matrices as the network-dependent parameters. This approach provides flexible
modeling of network-independent trends in the observations as well as
uncertainty quantification around the discovered network structure. We
establish a connection between our model and multi-task GPs and develop an
efficient stochastic variational inference algorithm for it. Furthermore, we
formally show that our approach is numerically stable and in fact numerically
easy to carry out almost everywhere on the support of the random variables
involved. Finally, we evaluate our model on three applications, showing that it
outperforms previous approaches. We provide a qualitative and quantitative
analysis of the structures discovered for domains such as the study of the full
genome regulation of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
