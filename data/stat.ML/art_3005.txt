Anomaly Detection Based on Indicators Aggregation
Automatic anomaly detection is a major issue in various areas. Beyond mere
detection, the identification of the source of the problem that produced the
anomaly is also essential. This is particularly the case in aircraft engine
health monitoring where detecting early signs of failure (anomalies) and
helping the engine owner to implement efficiently the adapted maintenance
operations (fixing the source of the anomaly) are of crucial importance to
reduce the costs attached to unscheduled maintenance. This paper introduces a
general methodology that aims at classifying monitoring signals into normal
ones and several classes of abnormal ones. The main idea is to leverage expert
knowledge by generating a very large number of binary indicators. Each
indicator corresponds to a fully parametrized anomaly detector built from
parametric anomaly scores designed by experts. A feature selection method is
used to keep only the most discriminant indicators which are used at inputs of
a Naive Bayes classifier. This give an interpretable classifier based on
interpretable anomaly detectors whose parameters have been optimized indirectly
by the selection process. The proposed methodology is evaluated on simulated
data designed to reproduce some of the anomaly types observed in real world
engines.
