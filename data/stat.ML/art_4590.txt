A Robust UCB Scheme for Active Learning in Regression from Strategic
  Crowds
We study the problem of training an accurate linear regression model by
procuring labels from multiple noisy crowd annotators, under a budget
constraint. We propose a Bayesian model for linear regression in crowdsourcing
and use variational inference for parameter estimation. To minimize the number
of labels crowdsourced from the annotators, we adopt an active learning
approach. In this specific context, we prove the equivalence of well-studied
criteria of active learning like entropy minimization and expected error
reduction. Interestingly, we observe that we can decouple the problems of
identifying an optimal unlabeled instance and identifying an annotator to label
it. We observe a useful connection between the multi-armed bandit framework and
the annotator selection in active learning. Due to the nature of the
distribution of the rewards on the arms, we use the Robust Upper Confidence
Bound (UCB) scheme with truncated empirical mean estimator to solve the
annotator selection problem. This yields provable guarantees on the regret. We
further apply our model to the scenario where annotators are strategic and
design suitable incentives to induce them to put in their best efforts.
