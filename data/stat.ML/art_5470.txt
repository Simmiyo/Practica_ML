Efficient Benchmarking of Algorithm Configuration Procedures via
  Model-Based Surrogates
The optimization of algorithm (hyper-)parameters is crucial for achieving
peak performance across a wide range of domains, ranging from deep neural
networks to solvers for hard combinatorial problems. The resulting algorithm
configuration (AC) problem has attracted much attention from the machine
learning community. However, the proper evaluation of new AC procedures is
hindered by two key hurdles. First, AC benchmarks are hard to set up. Second
and even more significantly, they are computationally expensive: a single run
of an AC procedure involves many costly runs of the target algorithm whose
performance is to be optimized in a given AC benchmark scenario. One common
workaround is to optimize cheap-to-evaluate artificial benchmark functions
(e.g., Branin) instead of actual algorithms; however, these have different
properties than realistic AC problems. Here, we propose an alternative
benchmarking approach that is similarly cheap to evaluate but much closer to
the original AC problem: replacing expensive benchmarks by surrogate benchmarks
constructed from AC benchmarks. These surrogate benchmarks approximate the
response surface corresponding to true target algorithm performance using a
regression model, and the original and surrogate benchmark share the same
(hyper-)parameter space. In our experiments, we construct and evaluate
surrogate benchmarks for hyperparameter optimization as well as for AC problems
that involve performance optimization of solvers for hard combinatorial
problems, drawing training data from the runs of existing AC procedures. We
show that our surrogate benchmarks capture overall important characteristics of
the AC scenarios, such as high- and low-performing regions, from which they
were derived, while being much easier to use and orders of magnitude cheaper to
evaluate.
