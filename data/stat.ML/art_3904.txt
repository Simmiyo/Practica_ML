Learning Protein Dynamics with Metastable Switching Systems
We introduce a machine learning approach for extracting fine-grained
representations of protein evolution from molecular dynamics datasets.
Metastable switching linear dynamical systems extend standard switching models
with a physically-inspired stability constraint. This constraint enables the
learning of nuanced representations of protein dynamics that closely match
physical reality. We derive an EM algorithm for learning, where the E-step
extends the forward-backward algorithm for HMMs and the M-step requires the
solution of large biconvex optimization problems. We construct an approximate
semidefinite program solver based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm and use it to
solve the M-step. We apply our EM algorithm to learn accurate dynamics from
large simulation datasets for the opioid peptide met-enkephalin and the
proto-oncogene Src-kinase. Our learned models demonstrate significant
improvements in temporal coherence over HMMs and standard switching models for
met-enkephalin, and sample transition paths (possibly useful in rational drug
design) for Src-kinase.
