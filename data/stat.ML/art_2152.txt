Convex Structure Learning for Bayesian Networks: Polynomial Feature
  Selection and Approximate Ordering
We present a new approach to learning the structure and parameters of a
Bayesian network based on regularized estimation in an exponential family
representation. Here we show that, given a fixed variable order, the optimal
structure and parameters can be learned efficiently, even without restricting
the size of the parent sets. We then consider the problem of optimizing the
variable order for a given set of features. This is still a computationally
hard problem, but we present a convex relaxation that yields an optimal 'soft'
ordering in polynomial time. One novel aspect of the approach is that we do not
perform a discrete search over DAG structures, nor over variable orders, but
instead solve a continuous relaxation that can then be rounded to obtain a
valid network structure. We conduct an experimental comparison against standard
structure search procedures over standard objectives, which cope with local
minima, and evaluate the advantages of using convex relaxations that reduce the
effects of local minima.
