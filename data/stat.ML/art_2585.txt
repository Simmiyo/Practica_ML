The algorithm of noisy k-means
In this note, we introduce a new algorithm to deal with finite dimensional
clustering with errors in variables. The design of this algorithm is based on
recent theoretical advances (see Loustau (2013a,b)) in statistical learning
with errors in variables. As the previous mentioned papers, the algorithm mixes
different tools from the inverse problem literature and the machine learning
community. Coarsely, it is based on a two-step procedure: (1) a deconvolution
step to deal with noisy inputs and (2) Newton's iterations as the popular
k-means.
