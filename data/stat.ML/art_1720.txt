Generalization error bounds for stationary autoregressive models
We derive generalization error bounds for stationary univariate
autoregressive (AR) models. We show that imposing stationarity is enough to
control the Gaussian complexity without further regularization. This lets us
use structural risk minimization for model selection. We demonstrate our
methods by predicting interest rate movements.
