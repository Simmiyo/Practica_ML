Training Restricted Boltzmann Machines on Word Observations
The restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a flexible tool for modeling
complex data, however there have been significant computational difficulties in
using RBMs to model high-dimensional multinomial observations. In natural
language processing applications, words are naturally modeled by K-ary discrete
distributions, where K is determined by the vocabulary size and can easily be
in the hundreds of thousands. The conventional approach to training RBMs on
word observations is limited because it requires sampling the states of K-way
softmax visible units during block Gibbs updates, an operation that takes time
linear in K. In this work, we address this issue by employing a more general
class of Markov chain Monte Carlo operators on the visible units, yielding
updates with computational complexity independent of K. We demonstrate the
success of our approach by training RBMs on hundreds of millions of word
n-grams using larger vocabularies than previously feasible and using the
learned features to improve performance on chunking and sentiment
classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on the latter.
