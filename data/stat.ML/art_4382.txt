Compression-Based Regularization with an Application to Multi-Task
  Learning
This paper investigates, from information theoretic grounds, a learning
problem based on the principle that any regularity in a given dataset can be
exploited to extract compact features from data, i.e., using fewer bits than
needed to fully describe the data itself, in order to build meaningful
representations of a relevant content (multiple labels). We begin by
introducing the noisy lossy source coding paradigm with the log-loss fidelity
criterion which provides the fundamental tradeoffs between the
\emph{cross-entropy loss} (average risk) and the information rate of the
features (model complexity). Our approach allows an information theoretic
formulation of the \emph{multi-task learning} (MTL) problem which is a
supervised learning framework in which the prediction models for several
related tasks are learned jointly from common representations to achieve better
generalization performance. Then, we present an iterative algorithm for
computing the optimal tradeoffs and its global convergence is proven provided
that some conditions hold. An important property of this algorithm is that it
provides a natural safeguard against overfitting, because it minimizes the
average risk taking into account a penalization induced by the model
complexity. Remarkably, empirical results illustrate that there exists an
optimal information rate minimizing the \emph{excess risk} which depends on the
nature and the amount of available training data. An application to
hierarchical text categorization is also investigated, extending previous
works.
