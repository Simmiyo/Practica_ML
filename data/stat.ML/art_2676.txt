Combined Independent Component Analysis and Canonical Polyadic
  Decomposition via Joint Diagonalization
Recently, there has been a trend to combine independent component analysis
and canonical polyadic decomposition (ICA-CPD) for an enhanced robustness for
the computation of CPD, and ICA-CPD could be further converted into CPD of a
5th-order partially symmetric tensor, by calculating the eigenmatrices of the
4th-order cumulant slices of a trilinear mixture. In this study, we propose a
new 5th-order CPD algorithm constrained with partial symmetry based on joint
diagonalization. As the main steps involved in the proposed algorithm undergo
no updating iterations for the loading matrices, it is much faster than the
existing algorithm based on alternating least squares and enhanced line search,
with competent performances. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the
performance of the proposed algorithm.
