On l_1 Mean and Variance Filtering
This paper addresses the problem of segmenting a time-series with respect to
changes in the mean value or in the variance. The first case is when the time
data is modeled as a sequence of independent and normal distributed random
variables with unknown, possibly changing, mean value but fixed variance. The
main assumption is that the mean value is piecewise constant in time, and the
task is to estimate the change times and the mean values within the segments.
The second case is when the mean value is constant, but the variance can
change. The assumption is that the variance is piecewise constant in time, and
we want to estimate change times and the variance values within the segments.
To find solutions to these problems, we will study an l_1 regularized maximum
likelihood method, related to the fused lasso method and l_1 trend filtering,
where the parameters to be estimated are free to vary at each sample. To
penalize variations in the estimated parameters, the l_1-norm of the time
difference of the parameters is used as a regularization term. This idea is
closely related to total variation denoising. The main contribution is that a
convex formulation of this variance estimation problem, where the
parametrization is based on the inverse of the variance, can be formulated as a
certain l_1 mean estimation problem. This implies that results and methods for
mean estimation can be applied to the challenging problem of variance
segmentation/estimation.
