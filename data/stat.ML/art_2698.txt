A Comprehensive Approach to Universal Piecewise Nonlinear Regression
  Based on Trees
In this paper, we investigate adaptive nonlinear regression and introduce
tree based piecewise linear regression algorithms that are highly efficient and
provide significantly improved performance with guaranteed upper bounds in an
individual sequence manner. We use a tree notion in order to partition the
space of regressors in a nested structure. The introduced algorithms adapt not
only their regression functions but also the complete tree structure while
achieving the performance of the "best" linear mixture of a doubly exponential
number of partitions, with a computational complexity only polynomial in the
number of nodes of the tree. While constructing these algorithms, we also avoid
using any artificial "weighting" of models (with highly data dependent
parameters) and, instead, directly minimize the final regression error, which
is the ultimate performance goal. The introduced methods are generic such that
they can readily incorporate different tree construction methods such as random
trees in their framework and can use different regressor or partitioning
functions as demonstrated in the paper.
