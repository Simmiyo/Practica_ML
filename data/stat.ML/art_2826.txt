The Potential Benefits of Filtering Versus Hyper-Parameter Optimization
The quality of an induced model by a learning algorithm is dependent on the
quality of the training data and the hyper-parameters supplied to the learning
algorithm. Prior work has shown that improving the quality of the training data
(i.e., by removing low quality instances) or tuning the learning algorithm
hyper-parameters can significantly improve the quality of an induced model. A
comparison of the two methods is lacking though. In this paper, we estimate and
compare the potential benefits of filtering and hyper-parameter optimization.
Estimating the potential benefit gives an overly optimistic estimate but also
empirically demonstrates an approximation of the maximum potential benefit of
each method. We find that, while both significantly improve the induced model,
improving the quality of the training set has a greater potential effect than
hyper-parameter optimization.
