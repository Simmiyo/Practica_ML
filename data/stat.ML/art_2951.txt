Bayesian Multitask Learning with Latent Hierarchies
We learn multiple hypotheses for related tasks under a latent hierarchical
relationship between tasks. We exploit the intuition that for domain
adaptation, we wish to share classifier structure, but for multitask learning,
we wish to share covariance structure. Our hierarchical model is seen to
subsume several previously proposed multitask learning models and performs well
on three distinct real-world data sets.
