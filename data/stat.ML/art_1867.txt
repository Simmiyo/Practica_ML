Smoothing Proximal Gradient Method for General Structured Sparse
  Learning
We study the problem of learning high dimensional regression models
regularized by a structured-sparsity-inducing penalty that encodes prior
structural information on either input or output sides. We consider two widely
adopted types of such penalties as our motivating examples: 1) overlapping
group lasso penalty, based on the l1/l2 mixed-norm penalty, and 2) graph-guided
fusion penalty. For both types of penalties, due to their non-separability,
developing an efficient optimization method has remained a challenging problem.
In this paper, we propose a general optimization approach, called smoothing
proximal gradient method, which can solve the structured sparse regression
problems with a smooth convex loss and a wide spectrum of
structured-sparsity-inducing penalties. Our approach is based on a general
smoothing technique of Nesterov. It achieves a convergence rate faster than the
standard first-order method, subgradient method, and is much more scalable than
the most widely used interior-point method. Numerical results are reported to
demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed method.
