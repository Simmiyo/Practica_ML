Functional Bandits
We introduce the functional bandit problem, where the objective is to find an
arm that optimises a known functional of the unknown arm-reward distributions.
These problems arise in many settings such as maximum entropy methods in
natural language processing, and risk-averse decision-making, but current
best-arm identification techniques fail in these domains. We propose a new
approach, that combines functional estimation and arm elimination, to tackle
this problem. This method achieves provably efficient performance guarantees.
In addition, we illustrate this method on a number of important functionals in
risk management and information theory, and refine our generic theoretical
results in those cases.
