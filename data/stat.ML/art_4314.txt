LSTM Networks for Data-Aware Remaining Time Prediction of Business
  Process Instances
Predicting the completion time of business process instances would be a very
helpful aid when managing processes under service level agreement constraints.
The ability to know in advance the trend of running process instances would
allow business managers to react in time, in order to prevent delays or
undesirable situations. However, making such accurate forecasts is not easy:
many factors may influence the required time to complete a process instance. In
this paper, we propose an approach based on deep Recurrent Neural Networks
(specifically LSTMs) that is able to exploit arbitrary information associated
to single events, in order to produce an as-accurate-as-possible prediction of
the completion time of running instances. Experiments on real-world datasets
confirm the quality of our proposal.
