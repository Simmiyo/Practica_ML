Kernel Regression by Mode Calculation of the Conditional Probability
  Distribution
The most direct way to express arbitrary dependencies in datasets is to
estimate the joint distribution and to apply afterwards the argmax-function to
obtain the mode of the corresponding conditional distribution. This method is
in practice difficult, because it requires a global optimization of a
complicated function, the joint distribution by fixed input variables. This
article proposes a method for finding global maxima if the joint distribution
is modeled by a kernel density estimation. Some experiments show advantages and
shortcomings of the resulting regression method in comparison to the standard
Nadaraya-Watson regression technique, which approximates the optimum by the
expectation value.
