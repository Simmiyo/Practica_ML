Group Symmetry and non-Gaussian Covariance Estimation
We consider robust covariance estimation with group symmetry constraints.
Non-Gaussian covariance estimation, e.g., Tyler scatter estimator and
Multivariate Generalized Gaussian distribution methods, usually involve
non-convex minimization problems. Recently, it was shown that the underlying
principle behind their success is an extended form of convexity over the
geodesics in the manifold of positive definite matrices. A modern approach to
improve estimation accuracy is to exploit prior knowledge via additional
constraints, e.g., restricting the attention to specific classes of covariances
which adhere to prior symmetry structures. In this paper, we prove that such
group symmetry constraints are also geodesically convex and can therefore be
incorporated into various non-Gaussian covariance estimators. Practical
examples of such sets include: circulant, persymmetric and complex/quaternion
proper structures. We provide a simple numerical technique for finding maximum
likelihood estimates under such constraints, and demonstrate their performance
advantage using synthetic experiments.
