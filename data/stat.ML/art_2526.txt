Copula Mixed-Membership Stochastic Blockmodel for Intra-Subgroup
  Correlations
The \emph{Mixed-Membership Stochastic Blockmodel (MMSB)} is a popular
framework for modeling social network relationships. It can fully exploit each
individual node's participation (or membership) in a social structure. Despite
its powerful representations, this model makes an assumption that the
distributions of relational membership indicators between two nodes are
independent. Under many social network settings, however, it is possible that
certain known subgroups of people may have high or low correlations in terms of
their membership categories towards each other, and such prior information
should be incorporated into the model. To this end, we introduce a \emph{Copula
Mixed-Membership Stochastic Blockmodel (cMMSB)} where an individual Copula
function is employed to jointly model the membership pairs of those nodes
within the subgroup of interest. The model enables the use of various Copula
functions to suit the scenario, while maintaining the membership's marginal
distribution, as needed, for modeling membership indicators with other nodes
outside of the subgroup of interest. We describe the proposed model and its
inference algorithm in detail for both the finite and infinite cases. In the
experiment section, we compare our algorithms with other popular models in
terms of link prediction, using both synthetic and real world data.
