Automated Analytic Asymptotic Evaluation of the Marginal Likelihood for
  Latent Models
We present and implement two algorithms for analytic asymptotic evaluation of
the marginal likelihood of data given a Bayesian network with hidden nodes. As
shown by previous work, this evaluation is particularly hard for latent
Bayesian network models, namely networks that include hidden variables, where
asymptotic approximation deviates from the standard BIC score. Our algorithms
solve two central difficulties in asymptotic evaluation of marginal likelihood
integrals, namely, evaluation of regular dimensionality drop for latent
Bayesian network models and computation of non-standard approximation formulas
for singular statistics for these models. The presented algorithms are
implemented in Matlab and Maple and their usage is demonstrated for marginal
likelihood approximations for Bayesian networks with hidden variables.
