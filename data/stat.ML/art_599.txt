Bootstrap Bias Corrections for Ensemble Methods
This paper examines the use of a residual bootstrap for bias correction in
machine learning regression methods. Accounting for bias is an important
obstacle in recent efforts to develop statistical inference for machine
learning methods. We demonstrate empirically that the proposed bootstrap bias
correction can lead to substantial improvements in both bias and predictive
accuracy. In the context of ensembles of trees, we show that this correction
can be approximated at only double the cost of training the original ensemble
without introducing additional variance. Our method is shown to improve
test-set accuracy over random forests by up to 70\% on example problems from
the UCI repository.
