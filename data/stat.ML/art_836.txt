GPflow: A Gaussian process library using TensorFlow
GPflow is a Gaussian process library that uses TensorFlow for its core
computations and Python for its front end. The distinguishing features of
GPflow are that it uses variational inference as the primary approximation
method, provides concise code through the use of automatic differentiation, has
been engineered with a particular emphasis on software testing and is able to
exploit GPU hardware.
