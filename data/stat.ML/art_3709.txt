Scalable Modeling of Conversational-role based Self-presentation
  Characteristics in Large Online Forums
Online discussion forums are complex webs of overlapping subcommunities
(macrolevel structure, across threads) in which users enact different roles
depending on which subcommunity they are participating in within a particular
time point (microlevel structure, within threads). This sub-network structure
is implicit in massive collections of threads. To uncover this structure, we
develop a scalable algorithm based on stochastic variational inference and
leverage topic models (LDA) along with mixed membership stochastic block (MMSB)
models. We evaluate our model on three large-scale datasets,
Cancer-ThreadStarter (22K users and 14.4K threads), Cancer-NameMention(15.1K
users and 12.4K threads) and StackOverFlow (1.19 million users and 4.55 million
threads). Qualitatively, we demonstrate that our model can provide useful
explanations of microlevel and macrolevel user presentation characteristics in
different communities using the topics discovered from posts. Quantitatively,
we show that our model does better than MMSB and LDA in predicting user reply
structure within threads. In addition, we demonstrate via synthetic data
experiments that the proposed active sub-network discovery model is stable and
recovers the original parameters of the experimental setup with high
probability.
