Estimation Stability with Cross Validation (ESCV)
Cross-validation (CV) is often used to select the regularization parameter in
high dimensional problems. However, when applied to the sparse modeling method
Lasso, CV leads to models that are unstable in high-dimensions, and
consequently not suited for reliable interpretation. In this paper, we propose
a model-free criterion ESCV based on a new estimation stability (ES) metric and
CV. Our proposed ESCV finds a locally ES-optimal model smaller than the CV
choice so that the it fits the data and also enjoys estimation stability
property. We demonstrate that ESCV is an effective alternative to CV at a
similar easily parallelizable computational cost. In particular, we compare the
two approaches with respect to several performance measures when applied to the
Lasso on both simulated and real data sets. For dependent predictors common in
practice, our main finding is that, ESCV cuts down false positive rates often
by a large margin, while sacrificing little of true positive rates. ESCV
usually outperforms CV in terms of parameter estimation while giving similar
performance as CV in terms of prediction. For the two real data sets from
neuroscience and cell biology, the models found by ESCV are less than half of
the model sizes by CV. Judged based on subject knowledge, they are more
plausible than those by CV as well. We also discuss some regularization
parameter alignment issues that come up in both approaches.
