Variational Relevance Vector Machines
The Support Vector Machine (SVM) of Vapnik (1998) has become widely
established as one of the leading approaches to pattern recognition and machine
learning. It expresses predictions in terms of a linear combination of kernel
functions centred on a subset of the training data, known as support vectors.
  Despite its widespread success, the SVM suffers from some important
limitations, one of the most significant being that it makes point predictions
rather than generating predictive distributions. Recently Tipping (1999) has
formulated the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), a probabilistic model whose
functional form is equivalent to the SVM. It achieves comparable recognition
accuracy to the SVM, yet provides a full predictive distribution, and also
requires substantially fewer kernel functions.
  The original treatment of the RVM relied on the use of type II maximum
likelihood (the `evidence framework') to provide point estimates of the
hyperparameters which govern model sparsity. In this paper we show how the RVM
can be formulated and solved within a completely Bayesian paradigm through the
use of variational inference, thereby giving a posterior distribution over both
parameters and hyperparameters. We demonstrate the practicality and performance
of the variational RVM using both synthetic and real world examples.
