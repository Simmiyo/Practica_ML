Families of dendrograms
A conceptual framework for cluster analysis from the viewpoint of p-adic
geometry is introduced by describing the space of all dendrograms for n
datapoints and relating it to the moduli space of p-adic Riemannian spheres
with punctures using a method recently applied by Murtagh (2004b). This method
embeds a dendrogram as a subtree into the Bruhat-Tits tree associated to the
p-adic numbers, and goes back to Cornelissen et al. (2001) in p-adic geometry.
After explaining the definitions, the concept of classifiers is discussed in
the context of moduli spaces, and upper bounds for the number of hidden
vertices in dendrograms are given.
