Cost-Sensitive Label Embedding for Multi-Label Classification
Label embedding (LE) is an important family of multi-label classification
algorithms that digest the label information jointly for better performance.
Different real-world applications evaluate performance by different cost
functions of interest. Current LE algorithms often aim to optimize one specific
cost function, but they can suffer from bad performance with respect to other
cost functions. In this paper, we resolve the performance issue by proposing a
novel cost-sensitive LE algorithm that takes the cost function of interest into
account. The proposed algorithm, cost-sensitive label embedding with
multidimensional scaling (CLEMS), approximates the cost information with the
distances of the embedded vectors by using the classic multidimensional scaling
approach for manifold learning. CLEMS is able to deal with both symmetric and
asymmetric cost functions, and effectively makes cost-sensitive decisions by
nearest-neighbor decoding within the embedded vectors. We derive theoretical
results that justify how CLEMS achieves the desired cost-sensitivity.
Furthermore, extensive experimental results demonstrate that CLEMS is
significantly better than a wide spectrum of existing LE algorithms and
state-of-the-art cost-sensitive algorithms across different cost functions.
