Mini-Batch Semi-Stochastic Gradient Descent in the Proximal Setting
We propose mS2GD: a method incorporating a mini-batching scheme for improving
the theoretical complexity and practical performance of semi-stochastic
gradient descent (S2GD). We consider the problem of minimizing a strongly
convex function represented as the sum of an average of a large number of
smooth convex functions, and a simple nonsmooth convex regularizer. Our method
first performs a deterministic step (computation of the gradient of the
objective function at the starting point), followed by a large number of
stochastic steps. The process is repeated a few times with the last iterate
becoming the new starting point. The novelty of our method is in introduction
of mini-batching into the computation of stochastic steps. In each step,
instead of choosing a single function, we sample $b$ functions, compute their
gradients, and compute the direction based on this. We analyze the complexity
of the method and show that it benefits from two speedup effects. First, we
prove that as long as $b$ is below a certain threshold, we can reach any
predefined accuracy with less overall work than without mini-batching. Second,
our mini-batching scheme admits a simple parallel implementation, and hence is
suitable for further acceleration by parallelization.
