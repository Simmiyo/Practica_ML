Efficient Transductive Online Learning via Randomized Rounding
Most traditional online learning algorithms are based on variants of mirror
descent or follow-the-leader. In this paper, we present an online algorithm
based on a completely different approach, tailored for transductive settings,
which combines "random playout" and randomized rounding of loss subgradients.
As an application of our approach, we present the first computationally
efficient online algorithm for collaborative filtering with trace-norm
constrained matrices. As a second application, we solve an open question
linking batch learning and transductive online learning
