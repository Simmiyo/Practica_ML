Bridging Information Criteria and Parameter Shrinkage for Model
  Selection
Model selection based on classical information criteria, such as BIC, is
generally computationally demanding, but its properties are well studied. On
the other hand, model selection based on parameter shrinkage by $\ell_1$-type
penalties is computationally efficient. In this paper we make an attempt to
combine their strengths, and propose a simple approach that penalizes the
likelihood with data-dependent $\ell_1$ penalties as in adaptive Lasso and
exploits a fixed penalization parameter. Even for finite samples, its model
selection results approximately coincide with those based on information
criteria; in particular, we show that in some special cases, this approach and
the corresponding information criterion produce exactly the same model. One can
also consider this approach as a way to directly determine the penalization
parameter in adaptive Lasso to achieve information criteria-like model
selection. As extensions, we apply this idea to complex models including
Gaussian mixture model and mixture of factor analyzers, whose model selection
is traditionally difficult to do; by adopting suitable penalties, we provide
continuous approximators to the corresponding information criteria, which are
easy to optimize and enable efficient model selection.
