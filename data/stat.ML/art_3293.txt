A New Vision of Collaborative Active Learning
Active learning (AL) is a learning paradigm where an active learner has to
train a model (e.g., a classifier) which is in principal trained in a
supervised way, but in AL it has to be done by means of a data set with
initially unlabeled samples. To get labels for these samples, the active
learner has to ask an oracle (e.g., a human expert) for labels. The goal is to
maximize the performance of the model and to minimize the number of queries at
the same time. In this article, we first briefly discuss the state of the art
and own, preliminary work in the field of AL. Then, we propose the concept of
collaborative active learning (CAL). With CAL, we will overcome some of the
harsh limitations of current AL. In particular, we envision scenarios where an
expert may be wrong for various reasons, there might be several or even many
experts with different expertise, the experts may label not only samples but
also knowledge at a higher level such as rules, and we consider that the
labeling costs depend on many conditions. Moreover, in a CAL process human
experts will profit by improving their own knowledge, too.
