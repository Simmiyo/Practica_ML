An Information Retrieval Approach to Finding Dependent Subspaces of
  Multiple Views
Finding relationships between multiple views of data is essential both for
exploratory analysis and as pre-processing for predictive tasks. A prominent
approach is to apply variants of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), a
classical method seeking correlated components between views. The basic CCA is
restricted to maximizing a simple dependency criterion, correlation, measured
directly between data coordinates. We introduce a new method that finds
dependent subspaces of views directly optimized for the data analysis task of
\textit{neighbor retrieval between multiple views}. We optimize mappings for
each view such as linear transformations to maximize cross-view similarity
between neighborhoods of data samples. The criterion arises directly from the
well-defined retrieval task, detects nonlinear and local similarities, is able
to measure dependency of data relationships rather than only individual data
coordinates, and is related to well understood measures of information
retrieval quality. In experiments we show the proposed method outperforms
alternatives in preserving cross-view neighborhood similarities, and yields
insights into local dependencies between multiple views.
