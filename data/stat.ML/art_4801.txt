An Empirical Comparison of Sampling Quality Metrics: A Case Study for
  Bayesian Nonnegative Matrix Factorization
In this work, we empirically explore the question: how can we assess the
quality of samples from some target distribution? We assume that the samples
are provided by some valid Monte Carlo procedure, so we are guaranteed that the
collection of samples will asymptotically approximate the true distribution.
Most current evaluation approaches focus on two questions: (1) Has the chain
mixed, that is, is it sampling from the distribution? and (2) How independent
are the samples (as MCMC procedures produce correlated samples)? Focusing on
the case of Bayesian nonnegative matrix factorization, we empirically evaluate
standard metrics of sampler quality as well as propose new metrics to capture
aspects that these measures fail to expose. The aspect of sampling that is of
particular interest to us is the ability (or inability) of sampling methods to
move between multiple optima in NMF problems. As a proxy, we propose and study
a number of metrics that might quantify the diversity of a set of NMF
factorizations obtained by a sampler through quantifying the coverage of the
posterior distribution. We compare the performance of a number of standard
sampling methods for NMF in terms of these new metrics.
