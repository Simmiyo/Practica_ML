Soft (Gaussian CDE) regression models and loss functions
Regression, unlike classification, has lacked a comprehensive and effective
approach to deal with cost-sensitive problems by the reuse (and not a
re-training) of general regression models. In this paper, a wide variety of
cost-sensitive problems in regression (such as bids, asymmetric losses and
rejection rules) can be solved effectively by a lightweight but powerful
approach, consisting of: (1) the conversion of any traditional one-parameter
crisp regression model into a two-parameter soft regression model, seen as a
normal conditional density estimator, by the use of newly-introduced enrichment
methods; and (2) the reframing of an enriched soft regression model to new
contexts by an instance-dependent optimisation of the expected loss derived
from the conditional normal distribution.
