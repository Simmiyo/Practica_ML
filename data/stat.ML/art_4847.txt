Learning Discriminative Features using Encoder-Decoder type Deep Neural
  Nets
As machine learning is applied to an increasing variety of complex problems,
which are defined by high dimensional and complex data sets, the necessity for
task oriented feature learning grows in importance. With the advancement of
Deep Learning algorithms, various successful feature learning techniques have
evolved. In this paper, we present a novel way of learning discriminative
features by training Deep Neural Nets which have Encoder or Decoder type
architecture similar to an Autoencoder. We demonstrate that our approach can
learn discriminative features which can perform better at pattern
classification tasks when the number of training samples is relatively small in
size.
