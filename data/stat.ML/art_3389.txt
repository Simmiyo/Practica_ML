An Average Classification Algorithm
Many classification algorithms produce a classifier that is a weighted
average of kernel evaluations. When working with a high or infinite dimensional
kernel, it is imperative for speed of evaluation and storage issues that as few
training samples as possible are used in the kernel expansion. Popular existing
approaches focus on altering standard learning algorithms, such as the Support
Vector Machine, to induce sparsity, as well as post-hoc procedures for sparse
approximations. Here we adopt the latter approach. We begin with a very simple
classifier, given by the kernel mean $$ f(x) = \frac{1}{n}
\sum\limits_{i=i}^{n} y_i K(x_i,x) $$ We then find a sparse approximation to
this kernel mean via herding. The result is an accurate, easily parallelized
algorithm for learning classifiers.
