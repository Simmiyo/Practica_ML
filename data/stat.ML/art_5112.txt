Predicting Process Behaviour using Deep Learning
Predicting business process behaviour is an important aspect of business
process management. Motivated by research in natural language processing, this
paper describes an application of deep learning with recurrent neural networks
to the problem of predicting the next event in a business process. This is both
a novel method in process prediction, which has largely relied on explicit
process models, and also a novel application of deep learning methods. The
approach is evaluated on two real datasets and our results surpass the
state-of-the-art in prediction precision.
