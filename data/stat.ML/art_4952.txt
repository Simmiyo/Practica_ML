A Tight Convex Upper Bound on the Likelihood of a Finite Mixture
The likelihood function of a finite mixture model is a non-convex function
with multiple local maxima and commonly used iterative algorithms such as EM
will converge to different solutions depending on initial conditions. In this
paper we ask: is it possible to assess how far we are from the global maximum
of the likelihood? Since the likelihood of a finite mixture model can grow
unboundedly by centering a Gaussian on a single datapoint and shrinking the
covariance, we constrain the problem by assuming that the parameters of the
individual models are members of a large discrete set (e.g. estimating a
mixture of two Gaussians where the means and variances of both Gaussians are
members of a set of a million possible means and variances). For this setting
we show that a simple upper bound on the likelihood can be computed using
convex optimization and we analyze conditions under which the bound is
guaranteed to be tight. This bound can then be used to assess the quality of
solutions found by EM (where the final result is projected on the discrete set)
or any other mixture estimation algorithm. For any dataset our method allows us
to find a finite mixture model together with a dataset-specific bound on how
far the likelihood of this mixture is from the global optimum of the likelihood
