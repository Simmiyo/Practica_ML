EnsembleSVM: A Library for Ensemble Learning Using Support Vector
  Machines
EnsembleSVM is a free software package containing efficient routines to
perform ensemble learning with support vector machine (SVM) base models. It
currently offers ensemble methods based on binary SVM models. Our
implementation avoids duplicate storage and evaluation of support vectors which
are shared between constituent models. Experimental results show that using
ensemble approaches can drastically reduce training complexity while
maintaining high predictive accuracy. The EnsembleSVM software package is
freely available online at http://esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/ensemblesvm.
