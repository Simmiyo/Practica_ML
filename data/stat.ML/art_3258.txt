Large-Scale Distributed Bayesian Matrix Factorization using Stochastic
  Gradient MCMC
Despite having various attractive qualities such as high prediction accuracy
and the ability to quantify uncertainty and avoid over-fitting, Bayesian Matrix
Factorization has not been widely adopted because of the prohibitive cost of
inference. In this paper, we propose a scalable distributed Bayesian matrix
factorization algorithm using stochastic gradient MCMC. Our algorithm, based on
Distributed Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics, can not only match the
prediction accuracy of standard MCMC methods like Gibbs sampling, but at the
same time is as fast and simple as stochastic gradient descent. In our
experiments, we show that our algorithm can achieve the same level of
prediction accuracy as Gibbs sampling an order of magnitude faster. We also
show that our method reduces the prediction error as fast as distributed
stochastic gradient descent, achieving a 4.1% improvement in RMSE for the
Netflix dataset and an 1.8% for the Yahoo music dataset.
