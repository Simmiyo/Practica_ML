Efficient Protocols for Distributed Classification and Optimization
In distributed learning, the goal is to perform a learning task over data
distributed across multiple nodes with minimal (expensive) communication. Prior
work (Daume III et al., 2012) proposes a general model that bounds the
communication required for learning classifiers while allowing for $\eps$
training error on linearly separable data adversarially distributed across
nodes.
  In this work, we develop key improvements and extensions to this basic model.
Our first result is a two-party multiplicative-weight-update based protocol
that uses $O(d^2 \log{1/\eps})$ words of communication to classify distributed
data in arbitrary dimension $d$, $\eps$-optimally. This readily extends to
classification over $k$ nodes with $O(kd^2 \log{1/\eps})$ words of
communication. Our proposed protocol is simple to implement and is considerably
more efficient than baselines compared, as demonstrated by our empirical
results.
  In addition, we illustrate general algorithm design paradigms for doing
efficient learning over distributed data. We show how to solve
fixed-dimensional and high dimensional linear programming efficiently in a
distributed setting where constraints may be distributed across nodes. Since
many learning problems can be viewed as convex optimization problems where
constraints are generated by individual points, this models many typical
distributed learning scenarios. Our techniques make use of a novel connection
from multipass streaming, as well as adapting the multiplicative-weight-update
framework more generally to a distributed setting. As a consequence, our
methods extend to the wide range of problems solvable using these techniques.
