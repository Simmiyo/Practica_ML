Distributed Adaptive Learning of Graph Signals
The aim of this paper is to propose distributed strategies for adaptive
learning of signals defined over graphs. Assuming the graph signal to be
bandlimited, the method enables distributed reconstruction, with guaranteed
performance in terms of mean-square error, and tracking from a limited number
of sampled observations taken from a subset of vertices. A detailed mean square
analysis is carried out and illustrates the role played by the sampling
strategy on the performance of the proposed method. Finally, some useful
strategies for distributed selection of the sampling set are provided. Several
numerical results validate our theoretical findings, and illustrate the
performance of the proposed method for distributed adaptive learning of signals
defined over graphs.
