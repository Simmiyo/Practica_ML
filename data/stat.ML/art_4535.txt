Doubly Stochastic Primal-Dual Coordinate Method for Bilinear
  Saddle-Point Problem
We propose a doubly stochastic primal-dual coordinate optimization algorithm
for empirical risk minimization, which can be formulated as a bilinear
saddle-point problem. In each iteration, our method randomly samples a block of
coordinates of the primal and dual solutions to update. The linear convergence
of our method could be established in terms of 1) the distance from the current
iterate to the optimal solution and 2) the primal-dual objective gap. We show
that the proposed method has a lower overall complexity than existing
coordinate methods when either the data matrix has a factorized structure or
the proximal mapping on each block is computationally expensive, e.g.,
involving an eigenvalue decomposition. The efficiency of the proposed method is
confirmed by empirical studies on several real applications, such as the
multi-task large margin nearest neighbor problem.
