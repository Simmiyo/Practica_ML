Nonparametric Unsupervised Classification
Unsupervised classification methods learn a discriminative classifier from
unlabeled data, which has been proven to be an effective way of simultaneously
clustering the data and training a classifier from the data. Various
unsupervised classification methods obtain appealing results by the classifiers
learned in an unsupervised manner. However, existing methods do not consider
the misclassification error of the unsupervised classifiers except unsupervised
SVM, so the performance of the unsupervised classifiers is not fully evaluated.
In this work, we study the misclassification error of two popular classifiers,
i.e. the nearest neighbor classifier (NN) and the plug-in classifier, in the
setting of unsupervised classification.
