NonSTOP: A NonSTationary Online Prediction Method for Time Series
We present online prediction methods for time series that let us explicitly
handle nonstationary artifacts (e.g. trend and seasonality) present in most
real time series. Specifically, we show that applying appropriate
transformations to such time series before prediction can lead to improved
theoretical and empirical prediction performance. Moreover, since these
transformations are usually unknown, we employ the learning with experts
setting to develop a fully online method (NonSTOP-NonSTationary Online
Prediction) for predicting nonstationary time series. This framework allows for
seasonality and/or other trends in univariate time series and cointegration in
multivariate time series. Our algorithms and regret analysis subsume recent
related work while significantly expanding the applicability of such methods.
For all the methods, we provide sub-linear regret bounds using relaxed
assumptions. The theoretical guarantees do not fully capture the benefits of
the transformations, thus we provide a data-dependent analysis of the
follow-the-leader algorithm that provides insight into the success of using
such transformations. We support all of our results with experiments on
simulated and real data.
