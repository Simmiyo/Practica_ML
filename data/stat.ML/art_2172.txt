A Function Approximation Approach to Estimation of Policy Gradient for
  POMDP with Structured Policies
We consider the estimation of the policy gradient in partially observable
Markov decision processes (POMDP) with a special class of structured policies
that are finite-state controllers. We show that the gradient estimation can be
done in the Actor-Critic framework, by making the critic compute a "value"
function that does not depend on the states of POMDP. This function is the
conditional mean of the true value function that depends on the states. We show
that the critic can be implemented using temporal difference (TD) methods with
linear function approximations, and the analytical results on TD and
Actor-Critic can be transfered to this case. Although Actor-Critic algorithms
have been used extensively in Markov decision processes (MDP), up to now they
have not been proposed for POMDP as an alternative to the earlier proposal
GPOMDP algorithm, an actor-only method. Furthermore, we show that the same idea
applies to semi-Markov problems with a subset of finite-state controllers.
