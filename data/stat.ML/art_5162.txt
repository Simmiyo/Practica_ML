Outlier Robust Online Learning
We consider the problem of learning from noisy data in practical settings
where the size of data is too large to store on a single machine. More
challenging, the data coming from the wild may contain malicious outliers. To
address the scalability and robustness issues, we present an online robust
learning (ORL) approach. ORL is simple to implement and has provable robustness
guarantee -- in stark contrast to existing online learning approaches that are
generally fragile to outliers. We specialize the ORL approach for two concrete
cases: online robust principal component analysis and online linear regression.
We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness advantages of ORL through
comprehensive simulations and predicting image tags on a large-scale data set.
We also discuss extension of the ORL to distributed learning and provide
experimental evaluations.
