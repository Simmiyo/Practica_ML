Spectral Clustering with Unbalanced Data
Spectral clustering (SC) and graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL)
algorithms are sensitive to how graphs are constructed from data. In particular
if the data has proximal and unbalanced clusters these algorithms can lead to
poor performance on well-known graphs such as $k$-NN, full-RBF,
$\epsilon$-graphs. This is because the objectives such as Ratio-Cut (RCut) or
normalized cut (NCut) attempt to tradeoff cut values with cluster sizes, which
are not tailored to unbalanced data. We propose a novel graph partitioning
framework, which parameterizes a family of graphs by adaptively modulating node
degrees in a $k$-NN graph. We then propose a model selection scheme to choose
sizable clusters which are separated by smallest cut values. Our framework is
able to adapt to varying levels of unbalancedness of data and can be naturally
used for small cluster detection. We theoretically justify our ideas through
limit cut analysis. Unsupervised and semi-supervised experiments on synthetic
and real data sets demonstrate the superiority of our method.
