Rademacher complexity of stationary sequences
We show how to control the generalization error of time series models wherein
past values of the outcome are used to predict future values. The results are
based on a generalization of standard i.i.d. concentration inequalities to
dependent data without the mixing assumptions common in the time series
setting. Our proof and the result are simpler than previous analyses with
dependent data or stochastic adversaries which use sequential Rademacher
complexities rather than the expected Rademacher complexity for i.i.d.
processes. We also derive empirical Rademacher results without mixing
assumptions resulting in fully calculable upper bounds.
