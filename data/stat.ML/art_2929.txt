On the Complexity of Best Arm Identification in Multi-Armed Bandit
  Models
The stochastic multi-armed bandit model is a simple abstraction that has
proven useful in many different contexts in statistics and machine learning.
Whereas the achievable limit in terms of regret minimization is now well known,
our aim is to contribute to a better understanding of the performance in terms
of identifying the m best arms. We introduce generic notions of complexity for
the two dominant frameworks considered in the literature: fixed-budget and
fixed-confidence settings. In the fixed-confidence setting, we provide the
first known distribution-dependent lower bound on the complexity that involves
information-theoretic quantities and holds when m is larger than 1 under
general assumptions. In the specific case of two armed-bandits, we derive
refined lower bounds in both the fixed-confidence and fixed-budget settings,
along with matching algorithms for Gaussian and Bernoulli bandit models. These
results show in particular that the complexity of the fixed-budget setting may
be smaller than the complexity of the fixed-confidence setting, contradicting
the familiar behavior observed when testing fully specified alternatives. In
addition, we also provide improved sequential stopping rules that have
guaranteed error probabilities and shorter average running times. The proofs
rely on two technical results that are of independent interest : a deviation
lemma for self-normalized sums (Lemma 19) and a novel change of measure
inequality for bandit models (Lemma 1).
