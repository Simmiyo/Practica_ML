Tensor-Dictionary Learning with Deep Kruskal-Factor Analysis
A multi-way factor analysis model is introduced for tensor-variate data of
any order. Each data item is represented as a (sparse) sum of Kruskal
decompositions, a Kruskal-factor analysis (KFA). KFA is nonparametric and can
infer both the tensor-rank of each dictionary atom and the number of dictionary
atoms. The model is adapted for online learning, which allows dictionary
learning on large data sets. After KFA is introduced, the model is extended to
a deep convolutional tensor-factor analysis, supervised by a Bayesian SVM. The
experiments section demonstrates the improvement of KFA over vectorized
approaches (e.g., BPFA), tensor decompositions, and convolutional neural
networks (CNN) in multi-way denoising, blind inpainting, and image
classification. The improvement in PSNR for the inpainting results over other
methods exceeds 1dB in several cases and we achieve state of the art results on
Caltech101 image classification.
