Fast Adaptive Weight Noise
Marginalising out uncertain quantities within the internal representations or
parameters of neural networks is of central importance for a wide range of
learning techniques, such as empirical, variational or full Bayesian methods.
We set out to generalise fast dropout (Wang & Manning, 2013) to cover a wider
variety of noise processes in neural networks. This leads to an efficient
calculation of the marginal likelihood and predictive distribution which evades
sampling and the consequential increase in training time due to highly variant
gradient estimates. This allows us to approximate variational Bayes for the
parameters of feed-forward neural networks. Inspired by the minimum description
length principle, we also propose and experimentally verify the direct
optimisation of the regularised predictive distribution. The methods yield
results competitive with previous neural network based approaches and Gaussian
processes on a wide range of regression tasks.
