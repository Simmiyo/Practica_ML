Classification in biological networks with hypergraphlet kernels
Biological and cellular systems are often modeled as graphs in which vertices
represent objects of interest (genes, proteins, drugs) and edges represent
relational ties among these objects (binds-to, interacts-with, regulates). This
approach has been highly successful owing to the theory, methodology and
software that support analysis and learning on graphs. Graphs, however, often
suffer from information loss when modeling physical systems due to their
inability to accurately represent multiobject relationships. Hypergraphs, a
generalization of graphs, provide a framework to mitigate information loss and
unify disparate graph-based methodologies. In this paper, we present a
hypergraph-based approach for modeling physical systems and formulate vertex
classification, edge classification and link prediction problems on
(hyper)graphs as instances of vertex classification on (extended, dual)
hypergraphs in a semi-supervised setting. We introduce a novel kernel method on
vertex- and edge-labeled (colored) hypergraphs for analysis and learning. The
method is based on exact and inexact (via hypergraph edit distances)
enumeration of small simple hypergraphs, referred to as hypergraphlets, rooted
at a vertex of interest. We extensively evaluate this method and show its
potential use in a positive-unlabeled setting to estimate the number of missing
and false positive links in protein-protein interaction networks.
