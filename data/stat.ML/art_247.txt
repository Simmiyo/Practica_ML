Perturbative Corrections for Approximate Inference in Gaussian Latent
  Variable Models
Expectation Propagation (EP) provides a framework for approximate inference.
When the model under consideration is over a latent Gaussian field, with the
approximation being Gaussian, we show how these approximations can
systematically be corrected. A perturbative expansion is made of the exact but
intractable correction, and can be applied to the model's partition function
and other moments of interest. The correction is expressed over the
higher-order cumulants which are neglected by EP's local matching of moments.
Through the expansion, we see that EP is correct to first order. By considering
higher orders, corrections of increasing polynomial complexity can be applied
to the approximation. The second order provides a correction in quadratic time,
which we apply to an array of Gaussian process and Ising models. The
corrections generalize to arbitrarily complex approximating families, which we
illustrate on tree-structured Ising model approximations. Furthermore, they
provide a polynomial-time assessment of the approximation error. We also
provide both theoretical and practical insights on the exactness of the EP
solution.
