Improved Graph Clustering
Graph clustering involves the task of dividing nodes into clusters, so that
the edge density is higher within clusters as opposed to across clusters. A
natural, classic and popular statistical setting for evaluating solutions to
this problem is the stochastic block model, also referred to as the planted
partition model.
  In this paper we present a new algorithm--a convexified version of Maximum
Likelihood--for graph clustering. We show that, in the classic stochastic block
model setting, it outperforms existing methods by polynomial factors when the
cluster size is allowed to have general scalings. In fact, it is within
logarithmic factors of known lower bounds for spectral methods, and there is
evidence suggesting that no polynomial time algorithm would do significantly
better.
  We then show that this guarantee carries over to a more general extension of
the stochastic block model. Our method can handle the settings of semi-random
graphs, heterogeneous degree distributions, unequal cluster sizes, unaffiliated
nodes, partially observed graphs and planted clique/coloring etc. In
particular, our results provide the best exact recovery guarantees to date for
the planted partition, planted k-disjoint-cliques and planted noisy coloring
models with general cluster sizes; in other settings, we match the best
existing results up to logarithmic factors.
