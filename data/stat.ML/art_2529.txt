Learning Using Privileged Information: SVM+ and Weighted SVM
Prior knowledge can be used to improve predictive performance of learning
algorithms or reduce the amount of data required for training. The same goal is
pursued within the learning using privileged information paradigm which was
recently introduced by Vapnik et al. and is aimed at utilizing additional
information available only at training time -- a framework implemented by SVM+.
We relate the privileged information to importance weighting and show that the
prior knowledge expressible with privileged features can also be encoded by
weights associated with every training example. We show that a weighted SVM can
always replicate an SVM+ solution, while the converse is not true and we
construct a counterexample highlighting the limitations of SVM+. Finally, we
touch on the problem of choosing weights for weighted SVMs when privileged
features are not available.
