Bayesian Classification and Regression with High Dimensional Features
This thesis responds to the challenges of using a large number, such as
thousands, of features in regression and classification problems.
  There are two situations where such high dimensional features arise. One is
when high dimensional measurements are available, for example, gene expression
data produced by microarray techniques. For computational or other reasons,
people may select only a small subset of features when modelling such data, by
looking at how relevant the features are to predicting the response, based on
some measure such as correlation with the response in the training data.
Although it is used very commonly, this procedure will make the response appear
more predictable than it actually is. In Chapter 2, we propose a Bayesian
method to avoid this selection bias, with application to naive Bayes models and
mixture models.
  High dimensional features also arise when we consider high-order
interactions. The number of parameters will increase exponentially with the
order considered. In Chapter 3, we propose a method for compressing a group of
parameters into a single one, by exploiting the fact that many predictor
variables derived from high-order interactions have the same values for all the
training cases. The number of compressed parameters may have converged before
considering the highest possible order. We apply this compression method to
logistic sequence prediction models and logistic classification models.
  We use both simulated data and real data to test our methods in both
chapters.
