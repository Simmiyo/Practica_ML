Multiple Kernel Learning: A Unifying Probabilistic Viewpoint
We present a probabilistic viewpoint to multiple kernel learning unifying
well-known regularised risk approaches and recent advances in approximate
Bayesian inference relaxations. The framework proposes a general objective
function suitable for regression, robust regression and classification that is
lower bound of the marginal likelihood and contains many regularised risk
approaches as special cases. Furthermore, we derive an efficient and provably
convergent optimisation algorithm.
