Non-Redundant Spectral Dimensionality Reduction
Spectral dimensionality reduction algorithms are widely used in numerous
domains, including for recognition, segmentation, tracking and visualization.
However, despite their popularity, these algorithms suffer from a major
limitation known as the "repeated Eigen-directions" phenomenon. That is, many
of the embedding coordinates they produce typically capture the same direction
along the data manifold. This leads to redundant and inefficient
representations that do not reveal the true intrinsic dimensionality of the
data. In this paper, we propose a general method for avoiding redundancy in
spectral algorithms. Our approach relies on replacing the orthogonality
constraints underlying those methods by unpredictability constraints.
Specifically, we require that each embedding coordinate be unpredictable (in
the statistical sense) from all previous ones. We prove that these constraints
necessarily prevent redundancy, and provide a simple technique to incorporate
them into existing methods. As we illustrate on challenging high-dimensional
scenarios, our approach produces significantly more informative and compact
representations, which improve visualization and classification tasks.
