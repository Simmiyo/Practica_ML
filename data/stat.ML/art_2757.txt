Causal Discovery in a Binary Exclusive-or Skew Acyclic Model: BExSAM
Discovering causal relations among observed variables in a given data set is
a major objective in studies of statistics and artificial intelligence.
Recently, some techniques to discover a unique causal model have been explored
based on non-Gaussianity of the observed data distribution. However, most of
these are limited to continuous data. In this paper, we present a novel causal
model for binary data and propose an efficient new approach to deriving the
unique causal model governing a given binary data set under skew distributions
of external binary noises. Experimental evaluation shows excellent performance
for both artificial and real world data sets.
