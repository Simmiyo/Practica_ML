Prediction with Advice of Unknown Number of Experts
In the framework of prediction with expert advice, we consider a recently
introduced kind of regret bounds: the bounds that depend on the effective
instead of nominal number of experts. In contrast to the Normal- Hedge bound,
which mainly depends on the effective number of experts but also weakly depends
on the nominal one, we obtain a bound that does not contain the nominal number
of experts at all. We use the defensive forecasting method and introduce an
application of defensive forecasting to multivalued supermartingales.
