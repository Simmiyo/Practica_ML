Stochastic Matrix Factorization
This paper considers a restriction to non-negative matrix factorization in
which at least one matrix factor is stochastic. That is, the elements of the
matrix factors are non-negative and the columns of one matrix factor sum to 1.
This restriction includes topic models, a popular method for analyzing
unstructured data. It also includes a method for storing and finding pictures.
The paper presents necessary and sufficient conditions on the observed data
such that the factorization is unique. In addition, the paper characterizes
natural bounds on the parameters for any observed data and presents a
consistent least squares estimator. The results are illustrated using a topic
model analysis of PhD abstracts in economics and the problem of storing and
retrieving a set of pictures of faces.
