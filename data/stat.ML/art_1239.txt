Reducing Crowdsourcing to Graphon Estimation, Statistically
Inferring the correct answers to binary tasks based on multiple noisy answers
in an unsupervised manner has emerged as the canonical question for micro-task
crowdsourcing or more generally aggregating opinions. In graphon estimation,
one is interested in estimating edge intensities or probabilities between nodes
using a single snapshot of a graph realization. In the recent literature, there
has been exciting development within both of these topics. In the context of
crowdsourcing, the key intellectual challenge is to understand whether a given
task can be more accurately denoised by aggregating answers collected from
other different tasks. In the context of graphon estimation, precise
information limits and estimation algorithms remain of interest. In this paper,
we utilize a statistical reduction from crowdsourcing to graphon estimation to
advance the state-of-art for both of these challenges. We use concepts from
graphon estimation to design an algorithm that achieves better performance than
the {\em majority voting} scheme for a setup that goes beyond the {\em rank
one} models considered in the literature. We use known explicit lower bounds
for crowdsourcing to provide refined lower bounds for graphon estimation.
