Understanding Innovation to Drive Sustainable Development
Innovation is among the key factors driving a country's economic and social
growth. But what are the factors that make a country innovative? How do they
differ across different parts of the world and different stages of development?
In this work done in collaboration with the World Economic Forum (WEF), we
analyze the scores obtained through executive opinion surveys that constitute
the WEF's Global Competitiveness Index in conjunction with other country-level
metrics and indicators to identify actionable levers of innovation. The
findings can help country leaders and organizations shape the policies to drive
developmental activities and increase the capacity of innovation.
