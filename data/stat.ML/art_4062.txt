Embedding Projector: Interactive Visualization and Interpretation of
  Embeddings
Embeddings are ubiquitous in machine learning, appearing in recommender
systems, NLP, and many other applications. Researchers and developers often
need to explore the properties of a specific embedding, and one way to analyze
embeddings is to visualize them. We present the Embedding Projector, a tool for
interactive visualization and interpretation of embeddings.
