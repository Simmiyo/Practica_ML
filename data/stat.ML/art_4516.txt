Layered Logic Classifiers: Exploring the `And' and `Or' Relations
Designing effective and efficient classifier for pattern analysis is a key
problem in machine learning and computer vision. Many the solutions to the
problem require to perform logic operations such as `and', `or', and `not'.
Classification and regression tree (CART) include these operations explicitly.
Other methods such as neural networks, SVM, and boosting learn/compute a
weighted sum on features (weak classifiers), which weakly perform the 'and' and
'or' operations. However, it is hard for these classifiers to deal with the
'xor' pattern directly. In this paper, we propose layered logic classifiers for
patterns of complicated distributions by combining the `and', `or', and `not'
operations. The proposed algorithm is very general and easy to implement. We
test the classifiers on several typical datasets from the Irvine repository and
two challenging vision applications, object segmentation and pedestrian
detection. We observe significant improvements on all the datasets over the
widely used decision stump based AdaBoost algorithm. The resulting classifiers
have much less training complexity than decision tree based AdaBoost, and can
be applied in a wide range of domains.
