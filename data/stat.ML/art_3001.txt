Parallel Distributed Block Coordinate Descent Methods based on Pairwise
  Comparison Oracle
This paper provides a block coordinate descent algorithm to solve
unconstrained optimization problems. In our algorithm, computation of function
values or gradients is not required. Instead, pairwise comparison of function
values is used. Our algorithm consists of two steps; one is the direction
estimate step and the other is the search step. Both steps require only
pairwise comparison of function values, which tells us only the order of
function values over two points. In the direction estimate step, a Newton type
search direction is estimated. A computation method like block coordinate
descent methods is used with the pairwise comparison. In the search step, a
numerical solution is updated along the estimated direction. The computation in
the direction estimate step can be easily parallelized, and thus, the algorithm
works efficiently to find the minimizer of the objective function. Also, we
show an upper bound of the convergence rate. In numerical experiments, we show
that our method efficiently finds the optimal solution compared to some
existing methods based on the pairwise comparison.
