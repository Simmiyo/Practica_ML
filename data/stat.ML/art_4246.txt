Graph Convolution: A High-Order and Adaptive Approach
In this paper, we presented a novel convolutional neural network framework
for graph modeling, with the introduction of two new modules specially designed
for graph-structured data: the $k$-th order convolution operator and the
adaptive filtering module. Importantly, our framework of High-order and
Adaptive Graph Convolutional Network (HA-GCN) is a general-purposed
architecture that fits various applications on both node and graph centrics, as
well as graph generative models. We conducted extensive experiments on
demonstrating the advantages of our framework. Particularly, our HA-GCN
outperforms the state-of-the-art models on node classification and molecule
property prediction tasks. It also generates 32% more real molecules on the
molecule generation task, both of which will significantly benefit real-world
applications such as material design and drug screening.
