Sparse Approximation of a Kernel Mean
Kernel means are frequently used to represent probability distributions in
machine learning problems. In particular, the well known kernel density
estimator and the kernel mean embedding both have the form of a kernel mean.
Unfortunately, kernel means are faced with scalability issues. A single point
evaluation of the kernel density estimator, for example, requires a computation
time linear in the training sample size. To address this challenge, we present
a method to efficiently construct a sparse approximation of a kernel mean. We
do so by first establishing an incoherence-based bound on the approximation
error, and then noticing that, for the case of radial kernels, the bound can be
minimized by solving the $k$-center problem. The outcome is a linear time
construction of a sparse kernel mean, which also lends itself naturally to an
automatic sparsity selection scheme. We show the computational gains of our
method by looking at three problems involving kernel means: Euclidean embedding
of distributions, class proportion estimation, and clustering using the
mean-shift algorithm.
