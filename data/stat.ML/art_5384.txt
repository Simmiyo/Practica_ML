Model-Based Multiple Instance Learning
While Multiple Instance (MI) data are point patterns -- sets or multi-sets of
unordered points -- appropriate statistical point pattern models have not been
used in MI learning. This article proposes a framework for model-based MI
learning using point process theory. Likelihood functions for point pattern
data derived from point process theory enable principled yet conceptually
transparent extensions of learning tasks, such as classification, novelty
detection and clustering, to point pattern data. Furthermore, tractable point
pattern models as well as solutions for learning and decision making from point
pattern data are developed.
