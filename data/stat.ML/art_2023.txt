Convex Point Estimation using Undirected Bayesian Transfer Hierarchies
When related learning tasks are naturally arranged in a hierarchy, an
appealing approach for coping with scarcity of instances is that of transfer
learning using a hierarchical Bayes framework. As fully Bayesian computations
can be difficult and computationally demanding, it is often desirable to use
posterior point estimates that facilitate (relatively) efficient prediction.
However, the hierarchical Bayes framework does not always lend itself naturally
to this maximum aposteriori goal. In this work we propose an undirected
reformulation of hierarchical Bayes that relies on priors in the form of
similarity measures. We introduce the notion of "degree of transfer" weights on
components of these similarity measures, and show how they can be automatically
learned within a joint probabilistic framework. Importantly, our reformulation
results in a convex objective for many learning problems, thus facilitating
optimal posterior point estimation using standard optimization techniques. In
addition, we no longer require proper priors, allowing for flexible and
straightforward specification of joint distributions over transfer hierarchies.
We show that our framework is effective for learning models that are part of
transfer hierarchies for two real-life tasks: object shape modeling using
Gaussian density estimation and document classification.
