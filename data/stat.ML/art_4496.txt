Combining Multiple Clusterings via Crowd Agreement Estimation and
  Multi-Granularity Link Analysis
The clustering ensemble technique aims to combine multiple clusterings into a
probably better and more robust clustering and has been receiving an increasing
attention in recent years. There are mainly two aspects of limitations in the
existing clustering ensemble approaches. Firstly, many approaches lack the
ability to weight the base clusterings without access to the original data and
can be affected significantly by the low-quality, or even ill clusterings.
Secondly, they generally focus on the instance level or cluster level in the
ensemble system and fail to integrate multi-granularity cues into a unified
model. To address these two limitations, this paper proposes to solve the
clustering ensemble problem via crowd agreement estimation and
multi-granularity link analysis. We present the normalized crowd agreement
index (NCAI) to evaluate the quality of base clusterings in an unsupervised
manner and thus weight the base clusterings in accordance with their clustering
validity. To explore the relationship between clusters, the source aware
connected triple (SACT) similarity is introduced with regard to their common
neighbors and the source reliability. Based on NCAI and multi-granularity
information collected among base clusterings, clusters, and data instances, we
further propose two novel consensus functions, termed weighted evidence
accumulation clustering (WEAC) and graph partitioning with multi-granularity
link analysis (GP-MGLA) respectively. The experiments are conducted on eight
real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
robustness of the proposed methods.
