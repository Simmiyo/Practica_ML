Structure Learning of Probabilistic Graphical Models: A Comprehensive
  Survey
Probabilistic graphical models combine the graph theory and probability
theory to give a multivariate statistical modeling. They provide a unified
description of uncertainty using probability and complexity using the graphical
model. Especially, graphical models provide the following several useful
properties:
  - Graphical models provide a simple and intuitive interpretation of the
structures of probabilistic models. On the other hand, they can be used to
design and motivate new models.
  - Graphical models provide additional insights into the properties of the
model, including the conditional independence properties.
  - Complex computations which are required to perform inference and learning
in sophisticated models can be expressed in terms of graphical manipulations,
in which the underlying mathematical expressions are carried along implicitly.
  The graphical models have been applied to a large number of fields, including
bioinformatics, social science, control theory, image processing, marketing
analysis, among others. However, structure learning for graphical models
remains an open challenge, since one must cope with a combinatorial search over
the space of all possible structures.
  In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the existing structure
learning algorithms.
