Cost-Sensitive Reference Pair Encoding for Multi-Label Learning
Label space expansion for multi-label classification (MLC) is a methodology
that encodes the original label vectors to higher dimensional codes before
training and decodes the predicted codes back to the label vectors during
testing. The methodology has been demonstrated to improve the performance of
MLC algorithms when coupled with off-the-shelf error-correcting codes for
encoding and decoding. Nevertheless, such a coding scheme can be complicated to
implement, and cannot easily satisfy a common application need of
cost-sensitive MLC---adapting to different evaluation criteria of interest. In
this work, we show that a simpler coding scheme based on the concept of a
reference pair of label vectors achieves cost-sensitivity more naturally. In
particular, our proposed cost-sensitive reference pair encoding (CSRPE)
algorithm contains cluster-based encoding, weight-based training and
voting-based decoding steps, all utilizing the cost information. Furthermore,
we leverage the cost information embedded in the code space of CSRPE to propose
a novel active learning algorithm for cost-sensitive MLC. Extensive
experimental results verify that CSRPE performs better than state-of-the-art
algorithms across different MLC criteria. The results also demonstrate that the
CSRPE-backed active learning algorithm is superior to existing algorithms for
active MLC, and further justify the usefulness of CSRPE.
