Modular Representation of Layered Neural Networks
Layered neural networks have greatly improved the performance of various
applications including image processing, speech recognition, natural language
processing, and bioinformatics. However, it is still difficult to discover or
interpret knowledge from the inference provided by a layered neural network,
since its internal representation has many nonlinear and complex parameters
embedded in hierarchical layers. Therefore, it becomes important to establish a
new methodology by which layered neural networks can be understood.
  In this paper, we propose a new method for extracting a global and simplified
structure from a layered neural network. Based on network analysis, the
proposed method detects communities or clusters of units with similar
connection patterns. We show its effectiveness by applying it to three use
cases. (1) Network decomposition: it can decompose a trained neural network
into multiple small independent networks thus dividing the problem and reducing
the computation time. (2) Training assessment: the appropriateness of a trained
result with a given hyperparameter or randomly chosen initial parameters can be
evaluated by using a modularity index. And (3) data analysis: in practical data
it reveals the community structure in the input, hidden, and output layers,
which serves as a clue for discovering knowledge from a trained neural network.
