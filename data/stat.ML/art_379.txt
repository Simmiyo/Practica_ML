The EM algorithm and the Laplace Approximation
The Laplace approximation calls for the computation of second derivatives at
the likelihood maximum. When the maximum is found by the EM-algorithm, there is
a convenient way to compute these derivatives. The likelihood gradient can be
obtained from the EM-auxiliary, while the Hessian can be obtained from this
gradient with the Pearlmutter trick.
