The DLR Hierarchy of Approximate Inference
We propose a hierarchy for approximate inference based on the Dobrushin,
Lanford, Ruelle (DLR) equations. This hierarchy includes existing algorithms,
such as belief propagation, and also motivates novel algorithms such as
factorized neighbors (FN) algorithms and variants of mean field (MF)
algorithms. In particular, we show that extrema of the Bethe free energy
correspond to approximate solutions of the DLR equations. In addition, we
demonstrate a close connection between these approximate algorithms and Gibbs
sampling. Finally, we compare and contrast various of the algorithms in the DLR
hierarchy on spin-glass problems. The experiments show that algorithms higher
up in the hierarchy give more accurate results when they converge but tend to
be less stable.
