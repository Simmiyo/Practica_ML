Graph-Based Manifold Frequency Analysis for Denoising
We propose a new framework for manifold denoising based on processing in the
graph Fourier frequency domain, derived from the spectral decomposition of the
discrete graph Laplacian. Our approach uses the Spectral Graph Wavelet
transform in order to per- form non-iterative denoising directly in the graph
frequency domain, an approach inspired by conventional wavelet-based signal
denoising methods. We theoretically justify our approach, based on the fact
that for smooth manifolds the coordinate information energy is localized in the
low spectral graph wavelet sub-bands, while the noise affects all frequency
bands in a similar way. Experimental results show that our proposed manifold
frequency denoising (MFD) approach significantly outperforms the state of the
art denoising meth- ods, and is robust to a wide range of parameter selections,
e.g., the choice of k nearest neighbor connectivity of the graph.
