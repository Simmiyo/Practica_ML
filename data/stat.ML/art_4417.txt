Demystifying AlphaGo Zero as AlphaGo GAN
The astonishing success of AlphaGo Zero\cite{Silver_AlphaGo} invokes a
worldwide discussion of the future of our human society with a mixed mood of
hope, anxiousness, excitement and fear. We try to dymystify AlphaGo Zero by a
qualitative analysis to indicate that AlphaGo Zero can be understood as a
specially structured GAN system which is expected to possess an inherent good
convergence property. Thus we deduct the success of AlphaGo Zero may not be a
sign of a new generation of AI.
