Fast Graph Construction Using Auction Algorithm
In practical machine learning systems, graph based data representation has
been widely used in various learning paradigms, ranging from unsupervised
clustering to supervised classification. Besides those applications with
natural graph or network structure data, such as social network analysis and
relational learning, many other applications often involve a critical step in
converting data vectors to an adjacency graph. In particular, a sparse subgraph
extracted from the original graph is often required due to both theoretic and
practical needs. Previous study clearly shows that the performance of different
learning algorithms, e.g., clustering and classification, benefits from such
sparse subgraphs with balanced node connectivity. However, the existing graph
construction methods are either computationally expensive or with
unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we utilize a scalable method called
auction algorithm and its parallel extension to recover a sparse yet nearly
balanced subgraph with significantly reduced computational cost. Empirical
study and comparison with the state-ofart approaches clearly demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method in both efficiency and accuracy.
