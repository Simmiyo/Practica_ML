Multi-Stage Classifier Design
In many classification systems, sensing modalities have different acquisition
costs. It is often {\it unnecessary} to use every modality to classify a
majority of examples. We study a multi-stage system in a prediction time cost
reduction setting, where the full data is available for training, but for a
test example, measurements in a new modality can be acquired at each stage for
an additional cost. We seek decision rules to reduce the average measurement
acquisition cost. We formulate an empirical risk minimization problem (ERM) for
a multi-stage reject classifier, wherein the stage $k$ classifier either
classifies a sample using only the measurements acquired so far or rejects it
to the next stage where more attributes can be acquired for a cost. To solve
the ERM problem, we show that the optimal reject classifier at each stage is a
combination of two binary classifiers, one biased towards positive examples and
the other biased towards negative examples. We use this parameterization to
construct stage-by-stage global surrogate risk, develop an iterative algorithm
in the boosting framework and present convergence and generalization results.
We test our work on synthetic, medical and explosives detection datasets. Our
results demonstrate that substantial cost reduction without a significant
sacrifice in accuracy is achievable.
