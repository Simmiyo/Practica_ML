Efficient Parametric Projection Pursuit Density Estimation
Product models of low dimensional experts are a powerful way to avoid the
curse of dimensionality. We present the ``under-complete product of experts'
(UPoE), where each expert models a one dimensional projection of the data. The
UPoE is fully tractable and may be interpreted as a parametric probabilistic
model for projection pursuit. Its ML learning rules are identical to the
approximate learning rules proposed before for under-complete ICA. We also
derive an efficient sequential learning algorithm and discuss its relationship
to projection pursuit density estimation and feature induction algorithms for
additive random field models.
