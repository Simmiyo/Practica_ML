NESVM: a Fast Gradient Method for Support Vector Machines
Support vector machines (SVMs) are invaluable tools for many practical
applications in artificial intelligence, e.g., classification and event
recognition. However, popular SVM solvers are not sufficiently efficient for
applications with a great deal of samples as well as a large number of
features. In this paper, thus, we present NESVM, a fast gradient SVM solver
that can optimize various SVM models, e.g., classical SVM, linear programming
SVM and least square SVM. Compared against SVM-Perf
\cite{SVM_Perf}\cite{PerfML} (its convergence rate in solving the dual SVM is
upper bounded by $\mathcal O(1/\sqrt{k})$, wherein $k$ is the number of
iterations.) and Pegasos \cite{Pegasos} (online SVM that converges at rate
$\mathcal O(1/k)$ for the primal SVM), NESVM achieves the optimal convergence
rate at $\mathcal O(1/k^{2})$ and a linear time complexity. In particular,
NESVM smoothes the non-differentiable hinge loss and $\ell_1$-norm in the
primal SVM. Then the optimal gradient method without any line search is adopted
to solve the optimization. In each iteration round, the current gradient and
historical gradients are combined to determine the descent direction, while the
Lipschitz constant determines the step size. Only two matrix-vector
multiplications are required in each iteration round. Therefore, NESVM is more
efficient than existing SVM solvers. In addition, NESVM is available for both
linear and nonlinear kernels. We also propose "homotopy NESVM" to accelerate
NESVM by dynamically decreasing the smooth parameter and using the continuation
method. Our experiments on census income categorization, indoor/outdoor scene
classification, event recognition and scene recognition suggest the efficiency
and the effectiveness of NESVM. The MATLAB code of NESVM will be available on
our website for further assessment.
