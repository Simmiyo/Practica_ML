Asymptotic risks of Viterbi segmentation
We consider the maximum likelihood (Viterbi) alignment of a hidden Markov
model (HMM). In an HMM, the underlying Markov chain is usually hidden and the
Viterbi alignment is often used as the estimate of it. This approach will be
referred to as the Viterbi segmentation. The goodness of the Viterbi
segmentation can be measured by several risks. In this paper, we prove the
existence of asymptotic risks. Being independent of data, the asymptotic risks
can be considered as the characteristics of the model that illustrate the
long-run behavior of the Viterbi segmentation.
