Time Series Cluster Kernel for Learning Similarities between
  Multivariate Time Series with Missing Data
Similarity-based approaches represent a promising direction for time series
analysis. However, many such methods rely on parameter tuning, and some have
shortcomings if the time series are multivariate (MTS), due to dependencies
between attributes, or the time series contain missing data. In this paper, we
address these challenges within the powerful context of kernel methods by
proposing the robust \emph{time series cluster kernel} (TCK). The approach
taken leverages the missing data handling properties of Gaussian mixture models
(GMM) augmented with informative prior distributions. An ensemble learning
approach is exploited to ensure robustness to parameters by combining the
clustering results of many GMM to form the final kernel.
  We evaluate the TCK on synthetic and real data and compare to other
state-of-the-art techniques. The experimental results demonstrate that the TCK
is robust to parameter choices, provides competitive results for MTS without
missing data and outstanding results for missing data.
