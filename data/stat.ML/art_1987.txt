Optimization of Structured Mean Field Objectives
In intractable, undirected graphical models, an intuitive way of creating
structured mean field approximations is to select an acyclic tractable
subgraph. We show that the hardness of computing the objective function and
gradient of the mean field objective qualitatively depends on a simple graph
property. If the tractable subgraph has this property- we call such subgraphs
v-acyclic-a very fast block coordinate ascent algorithm is possible. If not,
optimization is harder, but we show a new algorithm based on the construction
of an auxiliary exponential family that can be used to make inference possible
in this case as well. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each
regime and compare the algorithms empirically.
