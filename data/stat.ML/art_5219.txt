Comparative study on supervised learning methods for identifying
  phytoplankton species
Phytoplankton plays an important role in marine ecosystem. It is defined as a
biological factor to assess marine quality. The identification of phytoplankton
species has a high potential for monitoring environmental, climate changes and
for evaluating water quality. However, phytoplankton species identification is
not an easy task owing to their variability and ambiguity due to thousands of
micro and pico-plankton species. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to build a
framework for identifying phytoplankton species and to perform a comparison on
different features types and classifiers. We propose a new features type
extracted from raw signals of phytoplankton species. We then analyze the
performance of various classifiers on the proposed features type as well as two
other features types for finding the robust one. Through experiments, it is
found that Random Forest using the proposed features gives the best
classification results with average accuracy up to 98.24%.
