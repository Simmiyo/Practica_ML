Non-parametric Bayesian modeling of complex networks
Modeling structure in complex networks using Bayesian non-parametrics makes
it possible to specify flexible model structures and infer the adequate model
complexity from the observed data. This paper provides a gentle introduction to
non-parametric Bayesian modeling of complex networks: Using an infinite mixture
model as running example we go through the steps of deriving the model as an
infinite limit of a finite parametric model, inferring the model parameters by
Markov chain Monte Carlo, and checking the model's fit and predictive
performance. We explain how advanced non-parametric models for complex networks
can be derived and point out relevant literature.
