Scalable Nonparametric Bayesian Inference on Point Processes with
  Gaussian Processes
In this paper we propose the first non-parametric Bayesian model using
Gaussian Processes to make inference on Poisson Point Processes without
resorting to gridding the domain or to introducing latent thinning points.
Unlike competing models that scale cubically and have a squared memory
requirement in the number of data points, our model has a linear complexity and
memory requirement. We propose an MCMC sampler and show that our model is
faster, more accurate and generates less correlated samples than competing
models on both synthetic and real-life data. Finally, we show that our model
easily handles data sizes not considered thus far by alternate approaches.
