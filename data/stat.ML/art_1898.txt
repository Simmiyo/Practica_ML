Testing whether linear equations are causal: A free probability theory
  approach
We propose a method that infers whether linear relations between two
high-dimensional variables X and Y are due to a causal influence from X to Y or
from Y to X. The earlier proposed so-called Trace Method is extended to the
regime where the dimension of the observed variables exceeds the sample size.
Based on previous work, we postulate conditions that characterize a causal
relation between X and Y. Moreover, we describe a statistical test and argue
that both causal directions are typically rejected if there is a common cause.
A full theoretical analysis is presented for the deterministic case but our
approach seems to be valid for the noisy case, too, for which we additionally
present an approach based on a sparsity constraint. The discussed method yields
promising results for both simulated and real world data.
