Fused Multiple Graphical Lasso
In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating multiple graphical
models simultaneously using the fused lasso penalty, which encourages adjacent
graphs to share similar structures. A motivating example is the analysis of
brain networks of Alzheimer's disease using neuroimaging data. Specifically, we
may wish to estimate a brain network for the normal controls (NC), a brain
network for the patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and a brain
network for Alzheimer's patients (AD). We expect the two brain networks for NC
and MCI to share common structures but not to be identical to each other;
similarly for the two brain networks for MCI and AD. The proposed formulation
can be solved using a second-order method. Our key technical contribution is to
establish the necessary and sufficient condition for the graphs to be
decomposable. Based on this key property, a simple screening rule is presented,
which decomposes the large graphs into small subgraphs and allows an efficient
estimation of multiple independent (small) subgraphs, dramatically reducing the
computational cost. We perform experiments on both synthetic and real data; our
results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.
