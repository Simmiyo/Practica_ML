Early Warning System for Seismic Events in Coal Mines Using Machine
  Learning
This document describes an approach to the problem of predicting dangerous
seismic events in active coal mines up to 8 hours in advance. It was developed
as a part of the AAIA'16 Data Mining Challenge: Predicting Dangerous Seismic
Events in Active Coal Mines. The solutions presented consist of ensembles of
various predictive models trained on different sets of features. The best one
achieved a winning score of 0.939 AUC.
