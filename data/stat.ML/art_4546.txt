Fast Asynchronous Parallel Stochastic Gradient Decent
Stochastic gradient descent~(SGD) and its variants have become more and more
popular in machine learning due to their efficiency and effectiveness. To
handle large-scale problems, researchers have recently proposed several
parallel SGD methods for multicore systems. However, existing parallel SGD
methods cannot achieve satisfactory performance in real applications. In this
paper, we propose a fast asynchronous parallel SGD method, called AsySVRG, by
designing an asynchronous strategy to parallelize the recently proposed SGD
variant called stochastic variance reduced gradient~(SVRG). Both theoretical
and empirical results show that AsySVRG can outperform existing
state-of-the-art parallel SGD methods like Hogwild! in terms of convergence
rate and computation cost.
