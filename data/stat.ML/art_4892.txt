Identifying Depression on Twitter
Social media has recently emerged as a premier method to disseminate
information online. Through these online networks, tens of millions of
individuals communicate their thoughts, personal experiences, and social
ideals. We therefore explore the potential of social media to predict, even
prior to onset, Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in online personas. We employ a
crowdsourced method to compile a list of Twitter users who profess to being
diagnosed with depression. Using up to a year of prior social media postings,
we utilize a Bag of Words approach to quantify each tweet. Lastly, we leverage
several statistical classifiers to provide estimates to the risk of depression.
Our work posits a new methodology for constructing our classifier by treating
social as a text-classification problem, rather than a behavioral one on social
media platforms. By using a corpus of 2.5M tweets, we achieved an 81% accuracy
rate in classification, with a precision score of .86. We believe that this
method may be helpful in developing tools that estimate the risk of an
individual being depressed, can be employed by physicians, concerned
individuals, and healthcare agencies to aid in diagnosis, even possibly
enabling those suffering from depression to be more proactive about recovering
from their mental health.
