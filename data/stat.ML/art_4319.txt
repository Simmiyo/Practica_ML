Adversarial Training for Disease Prediction from Electronic Health
  Records with Missing Data
Electronic health records (EHRs) have contributed to the computerization of
patient records and can thus be used not only for efficient and systematic
medical services, but also for research on biomedical data science. However,
there are many missing values in EHRs when provided in matrix form, which is an
important issue in many biomedical EHR applications. In this paper, we propose
a two-stage framework that includes missing data imputation and disease
prediction to address the missing data problem in EHRs. We compared the disease
prediction performance of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and
conventional learning algorithms in combination with missing data prediction
methods. As a result, we obtained a level of accuracy of 0.9777, sensitivity of
0.9521, specificity of 0.9925, area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.9889, and F-score of 0.9688 with a stacked autoencoder as
the missing data prediction method and an auxiliary classifier GAN (AC-GAN) as
the disease prediction method. The comparison results show that a combination
of a stacked autoencoder and an AC-GAN significantly outperforms other existing
approaches. Our results suggest that the proposed framework is more robust for
disease prediction from EHRs with missing data.
