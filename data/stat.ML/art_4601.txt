Online Optimization of Smoothed Piecewise Constant Functions
We study online optimization of smoothed piecewise constant functions over
the domain [0, 1). This is motivated by the problem of adaptively picking
parameters of learning algorithms as in the recently introduced framework by
Gupta and Roughgarden (2016). Majority of the machine learning literature has
focused on Lipschitz-continuous functions or functions with bounded gradients.
1 This is with good reason---any learning algorithm suffers linear regret even
against piecewise constant functions that are chosen adversarially, arguably
the simplest of non-Lipschitz continuous functions. The smoothed setting we
consider is inspired by the seminal work of Spielman and Teng (2004) and the
recent work of Gupta and Roughgarden---in this setting, the sequence of
functions may be chosen by an adversary, however, with some uncertainty in the
location of discontinuities. We give algorithms that achieve sublinear regret
in the full information and bandit settings.
