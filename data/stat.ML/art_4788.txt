Model-Agnostic Interpretability of Machine Learning
Understanding why machine learning models behave the way they do empowers
both system designers and end-users in many ways: in model selection, feature
engineering, in order to trust and act upon the predictions, and in more
intuitive user interfaces. Thus, interpretability has become a vital concern in
machine learning, and work in the area of interpretable models has found
renewed interest. In some applications, such models are as accurate as
non-interpretable ones, and thus are preferred for their transparency. Even
when they are not accurate, they may still be preferred when interpretability
is of paramount importance. However, restricting machine learning to
interpretable models is often a severe limitation. In this paper we argue for
explaining machine learning predictions using model-agnostic approaches. By
treating the machine learning models as black-box functions, these approaches
provide crucial flexibility in the choice of models, explanations, and
representations, improving debugging, comparison, and interfaces for a variety
of users and models. We also outline the main challenges for such methods, and
review a recently-introduced model-agnostic explanation approach (LIME) that
addresses these challenges.
