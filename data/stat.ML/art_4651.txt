IISCNLP at SemEval-2016 Task 2: Interpretable STS with ILP based
  Multiple Chunk Aligner
Interpretable semantic textual similarity (iSTS) task adds a crucial
explanatory layer to pairwise sentence similarity. We address various
components of this task: chunk level semantic alignment along with assignment
of similarity type and score for aligned chunks with a novel system presented
in this paper. We propose an algorithm, iMATCH, for the alignment of multiple
non-contiguous chunks based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP). Similarity
type and score assignment for pairs of chunks is done using a supervised
multiclass classification technique based on Random Forrest Classifier. Results
show that our algorithm iMATCH has low execution time and outperforms most
other participating systems in terms of alignment score. Of the three datasets,
we are top ranked for answer- students dataset in terms of overall score and
have top alignment score for headlines dataset in the gold chunks track.
