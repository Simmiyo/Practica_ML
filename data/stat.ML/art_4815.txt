Regression Trees and Random forest based feature selection for malaria
  risk exposure prediction
This paper deals with prediction of anopheles number, the main vector of
malaria risk, using environmental and climate variables. The variables
selection is based on an automatic machine learning method using regression
trees, and random forests combined with stratified two levels cross validation.
The minimum threshold of variables importance is accessed using the quadratic
distance of variables importance while the optimal subset of selected variables
is used to perform predictions. Finally the results revealed to be
qualitatively better, at the selection, the prediction , and the CPU time point
of view than those obtained by GLM-Lasso method.
