Semi-supervised Learning for Discrete Choice Models
We introduce a semi-supervised discrete choice model to calibrate discrete
choice models when relatively few requests have both choice sets and stated
preferences but the majority only have the choice sets. Two classic
semi-supervised learning algorithms, the expectation maximization algorithm and
the cluster-and-label algorithm, have been adapted to our choice modeling
problem setting. We also develop two new algorithms based on the
cluster-and-label algorithm. The new algorithms use the Bayesian Information
Criterion to evaluate a clustering setting to automatically adjust the number
of clusters. Two computational studies including a hotel booking case and a
large-scale airline itinerary shopping case are presented to evaluate the
prediction accuracy and computational effort of the proposed algorithms.
Algorithmic recommendations are rendered under various scenarios.
