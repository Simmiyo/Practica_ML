On the complexity of piecewise affine system identification
The paper provides results regarding the computational complexity of hybrid
system identification. More precisely, we focus on the estimation of piecewise
affine (PWA) maps from input-output data and analyze the complexity of
computing a global minimizer of the error. Previous work showed that a global
solution could be obtained for continuous PWA maps with a worst-case complexity
exponential in the number of data. In this paper, we show how global optimality
can be reached for a slightly more general class of possibly discontinuous PWA
maps with a complexity only polynomial in the number of data, however with an
exponential complexity with respect to the data dimension. This result is
obtained via an analysis of the intrinsic classification subproblem of
associating the data points to the different modes. In addition, we prove that
the problem is NP-hard, and thus that the exponential complexity in the
dimension is a natural expectation for any exact algorithm.
