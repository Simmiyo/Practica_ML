L0-norm Sparse Graph-regularized SVD for Biclustering
Learning the "blocking" structure is a central challenge for high dimensional
data (e.g., gene expression data). Recently, a sparse singular value
decomposition (SVD) has been used as a biclustering tool to achieve this goal.
However, this model ignores the structural information between variables (e.g.,
gene interaction graph). Although typical graph-regularized norm can
incorporate such prior graph information to get accurate discovery and better
interpretability, it fails to consider the opposite effect of variables with
different signs. Motivated by the development of sparse coding and
graph-regularized norm, we propose a novel sparse graph-regularized SVD as a
powerful biclustering tool for analyzing high-dimensional data. The key of this
method is to impose two penalties including a novel graph-regularized norm
($|\pmb{u}|\pmb{L}|\pmb{u}|$) and $L_0$-norm ($\|\pmb{u}\|_0$) on singular
vectors to induce structural sparsity and enhance interpretability. We design
an efficient Alternating Iterative Sparse Projection (AISP) algorithm to solve
it. Finally, we apply our method and related ones to simulated and real data to
show its efficiency in capturing natural blocking structures.
