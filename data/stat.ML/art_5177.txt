Graph Structure Learning from Unlabeled Data for Event Detection
Processes such as disease propagation and information diffusion often spread
over some latent network structure which must be learned from observation.
Given a set of unlabeled training examples representing occurrences of an event
type of interest (e.g., a disease outbreak), our goal is to learn a graph
structure that can be used to accurately detect future events of that type.
Motivated by new theoretical results on the consistency of constrained and
unconstrained subset scans, we propose a novel framework for learning graph
structure from unlabeled data by comparing the most anomalous subsets detected
with and without the graph constraints. Our framework uses the mean normalized
log-likelihood ratio score to measure the quality of a graph structure, and
efficiently searches for the highest-scoring graph structure. Using simulated
disease outbreaks injected into real-world Emergency Department data from
Allegheny County, we show that our method learns a structure similar to the
true underlying graph, but enables faster and more accurate detection.
