Regularization Techniques for Learning with Matrices
There is growing body of learning problems for which it is natural to
organize the parameters into matrix, so as to appropriately regularize the
parameters under some matrix norm (in order to impose some more sophisticated
prior knowledge). This work describes and analyzes a systematic method for
constructing such matrix-based, regularization methods. In particular, we focus
on how the underlying statistical properties of a given problem can help us
decide which regularization function is appropriate.
  Our methodology is based on the known duality fact: that a function is
strongly convex with respect to some norm if and only if its conjugate function
is strongly smooth with respect to the dual norm. This result has already been
found to be a key component in deriving and analyzing several learning
algorithms. We demonstrate the potential of this framework by deriving novel
generalization and regret bounds for multi-task learning, multi-class learning,
and kernel learning.
