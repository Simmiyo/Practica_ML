Learning Leading Indicators for Time Series Predictions
We consider the problem of learning models for forecasting multiple
time-series systems together with discovering the leading indicators that serve
as good predictors for the system. We model the systems by linear vector
autoregressive models (VAR) and link the discovery of leading indicators to
inferring sparse graphs of Granger-causality. We propose new problem
formulations and develop two new methods to learn such models, gradually
increasing the complexity of assumptions and approaches. While the first method
assumes common structures across the whole system, our second method uncovers
model clusters based on the Granger-causality and leading indicators together
with learning the model parameters. We study the performance of our methods on
a comprehensive set of experiments and confirm their efficacy and their
advantages over state-of-the-art sparse VAR and graphical Granger learning
methods.
