High-Dimensional Probability Estimation with Deep Density Models
One of the fundamental problems in machine learning is the estimation of a
probability distribution from data. Many techniques have been proposed to study
the structure of data, most often building around the assumption that
observations lie on a lower-dimensional manifold of high probability. It has
been more difficult, however, to exploit this insight to build explicit,
tractable density models for high-dimensional data. In this paper, we introduce
the deep density model (DDM), a new approach to density estimation. We exploit
insights from deep learning to construct a bijective map to a representation
space, under which the transformation of the distribution of the data is
approximately factorized and has identical and known marginal densities. The
simplicity of the latent distribution under the model allows us to feasibly
explore it, and the invertibility of the map to characterize contraction of
measure across it. This enables us to compute normalized densities for
out-of-sample data. This combination of tractability and flexibility allows us
to tackle a variety of probabilistic tasks on high-dimensional datasets,
including: rapid computation of normalized densities at test-time without
evaluating a partition function; generation of samples without MCMC; and
characterization of the joint entropy of the data.
