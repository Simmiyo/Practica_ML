OpenML: An R Package to Connect to the Machine Learning Platform OpenML
OpenML is an online machine learning platform where researchers can easily
share data, machine learning tasks and experiments as well as organize them
online to work and collaborate more efficiently. In this paper, we present an R
package to interface with the OpenML platform and illustrate its usage in
combination with the machine learning R package mlr. We show how the OpenML
package allows R users to easily search, download and upload data sets and
machine learning tasks. Furthermore, we also show how to upload results of
experiments, share them with others and download results from other users.
Beyond ensuring reproducibility of results, the OpenML platform automates much
of the drudge work, speeds up research, facilitates collaboration and increases
the users' visibility online.
