Sparse Distance Weighted Discrimination
Distance weighted discrimination (DWD) was originally proposed to handle the
data piling issue in the support vector machine. In this paper, we consider the
sparse penalized DWD for high-dimensional classification. The state-of-the-art
algorithm for solving the standard DWD is based on second-order cone
programming, however such an algorithm does not work well for the sparse
penalized DWD with high-dimensional data. In order to overcome the challenging
computation difficulty, we develop a very efficient algorithm to compute the
solution path of the sparse DWD at a given fine grid of regularization
parameters. We implement the algorithm in a publicly available R package sdwd.
We conduct extensive numerical experiments to demonstrate the computational
efficiency and classification performance of our method.
