Fuzzy Bayesian Learning
In this paper we propose a novel approach for learning from data using rule
based fuzzy inference systems where the model parameters are estimated using
Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. We show the
applicability of the method for regression and classification tasks using
synthetic data-sets and also a real world example in the financial services
industry. Then we demonstrate how the method can be extended for knowledge
extraction to select the individual rules in a Bayesian way which best explains
the given data. Finally we discuss the advantages and pitfalls of using this
method over state-of-the-art techniques and highlight the specific class of
problems where this would be useful.
