Fast mixing for Latent Dirichlet allocation
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are ubiquitous in probability
theory in general and in machine learning in particular. A Markov chain is
devised so that its stationary distribution is some probability distribution of
interest. Then one samples from the given distribution by running the Markov
chain for a "long time" until it appears to be stationary and then collects the
sample. However these chains are often very complex and there are no
theoretical guarantees that stationarity is actually reached. In this paper we
study the Gibbs sampler of the posterior distribution of a very simple case of
Latent Dirichlet Allocation, the arguably most well known Bayesian unsupervised
learning model for text generation and text classification. It is shown that
when the corpus consists of two long documents of equal length $m$ and the
vocabulary consists of only two different words, the mixing time is at most of
order $m^2\log m$ (which corresponds to $m\log m$ rounds over the corpus). It
will be apparent from our analysis that it seems very likely that the mixing
time is not much worse in the more relevant case when the number of documents
and the size of the vocabulary are also large as long as each word is
represented a large number in each document, even though the computations
involved may be intractable.
