Prediction of Dynamical time Series Using Kernel Based Regression and
  Smooth Splines
Prediction of dynamical time series with additive noise using support vector
machines or kernel based regression has been proved to be consistent for
certain classes of discrete dynamical systems. Consistency implies that these
methods are effective at computing the expected value of a point at a future
time given the present coordinates. However, the present coordinates themselves
are noisy, and therefore, these methods are not necessarily effective at
removing noise. In this article, we consider denoising and prediction as
separate problems for flows, as opposed to discrete time dynamical systems, and
show that the use of smooth splines is more effective at removing noise.
Combination of smooth splines and kernel based regression yields predictors
that are more accurate on benchmarks typically by a factor of 2 or more. We
prove that kernel based regression in combination with smooth splines converges
to the exact predictor for time series extracted from any compact invariant set
of any sufficiently smooth flow. As a consequence of convergence, one can find
examples where the combination of kernel based regression with smooth splines
is superior by even a factor of $100$. The predictors that we compute operate
on delay coordinate data and not the full state vector, which is typically not
observable.
