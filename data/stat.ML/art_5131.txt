WoCE: a framework for clustering ensemble by exploiting the wisdom of
  Crowds theory
The Wisdom of Crowds (WOC), as a theory in the social science, gets a new
paradigm in computer science. The WOC theory explains that the aggregate
decision made by a group is often better than those of its individual members
if specific conditions are satisfied. This paper presents a novel framework for
unsupervised and semi-supervised cluster ensemble by exploiting the WOC theory.
We employ four conditions in the WOC theory, i.e., diversity, independency,
decentralization and aggregation, to guide both the constructing of individual
clustering results and the final combination for clustering ensemble. Firstly,
independency criterion, as a novel mapping system on the raw data set, removes
the correlation between features on our proposed method. Then, decentralization
as a novel mechanism generates high-quality individual clustering results.
Next, uniformity as a new diversity metric evaluates the generated clustering
results. Further, weighted evidence accumulation clustering method is proposed
for the final aggregation without using thresholding procedure. Experimental
study on varied data sets demonstrates that the proposed approach achieves
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods.
