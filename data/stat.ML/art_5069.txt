A temporal model for multiple sclerosis course evolution
Multiple Sclerosis is a degenerative condition of the central nervous system
that affects nearly 2.5 million of individuals in terms of their physical,
cognitive, psychological and social capabilities. Researchers are currently
investigating on the use of patient reported outcome measures for the
assessment of impact and evolution of the disease on the life of the patients.
To date, a clear understanding on the use of such measures to predict the
evolution of the disease is still lacking. In this work we resort to
regularized machine learning methods for binary classification and multiple
output regression. We propose a pipeline that can be used to predict the
disease progression from patient reported measures. The obtained model is
tested on a data set collected from an ongoing clinical research project.
