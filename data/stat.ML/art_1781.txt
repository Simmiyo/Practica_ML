Iteration Complexity of Randomized Block-Coordinate Descent Methods for
  Minimizing a Composite Function
In this paper we develop a randomized block-coordinate descent method for
minimizing the sum of a smooth and a simple nonsmooth block-separable convex
function and prove that it obtains an $\epsilon$-accurate solution with
probability at least $1-\rho$ in at most $O(\tfrac{n}{\epsilon} \log
\tfrac{1}{\rho})$ iterations, where $n$ is the number of blocks. For strongly
convex functions the method converges linearly. This extends recent results of
Nesterov [Efficiency of coordinate descent methods on huge-scale optimization
problems, CORE Discussion Paper #2010/2], which cover the smooth case, to
composite minimization, while at the same time improving the complexity by the
factor of 4 and removing $\epsilon$ from the logarithmic term. More
importantly, in contrast with the aforementioned work in which the author
achieves the results by applying the method to a regularized version of the
objective function with an unknown scaling factor, we show that this is not
necessary, thus achieving true iteration complexity bounds. In the smooth case
we also allow for arbitrary probability vectors and non-Euclidean norms.
Finally, we demonstrate numerically that the algorithm is able to solve
huge-scale $\ell_1$-regularized least squares and support vector machine
problems with a billion variables.
