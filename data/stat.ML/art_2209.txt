How to sample if you must: on optimal functional sampling
We examine a fundamental problem that models various active sampling setups,
such as network tomography. We analyze sampling of a multivariate normal
distribution with an unknown expectation that needs to be estimated: in our
setup it is possible to sample the distribution from a given set of linear
functionals, and the difficulty addressed is how to optimally select the
combinations to achieve low estimation error. Although this problem is in the
heart of the field of optimal design, no efficient solutions for the case with
many functionals exist. We present some bounds and an efficient sub-optimal
solution for this problem for more structured sets such as binary functionals
that are induced by graph walks.
