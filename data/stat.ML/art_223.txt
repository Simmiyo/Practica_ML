A Bayesian Boosting Model
We offer a novel view of AdaBoost in a statistical setting. We propose a
Bayesian model for binary classification in which label noise is modeled
hierarchically. Using variational inference to optimize a dynamic evidence
lower bound, we derive a new boosting-like algorithm called VIBoost. We show
its close connections to AdaBoost and give experimental results from four
datasets.
