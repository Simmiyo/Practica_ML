Anomaly Detection Based on Aggregation of Indicators
Automatic anomaly detection is a major issue in various areas. Beyond mere
detection, the identification of the origin of the problem that produced the
anomaly is also essential. This paper introduces a general methodology that can
assist human operators who aim at classifying monitoring signals. The main idea
is to leverage expert knowledge by generating a very large number of
indicators. A feature selection method is used to keep only the most
discriminant indicators which are used as inputs of a Naive Bayes classifier.
The parameters of the classifier have been optimized indirectly by the
selection process. Simulated data designed to reproduce some of the anomaly
types observed in real world engines.
