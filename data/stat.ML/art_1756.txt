Beta processes, stick-breaking, and power laws
The beta-Bernoulli process provides a Bayesian nonparametric prior for models
involving collections of binary-valued features. A draw from the beta process
yields an infinite collection of probabilities in the unit interval, and a draw
from the Bernoulli process turns these into binary-valued features. Recent work
has provided stick-breaking representations for the beta process analogous to
the well-known stick-breaking representation for the Dirichlet process. We
derive one such stick-breaking representation directly from the
characterization of the beta process as a completely random measure. This
approach motivates a three-parameter generalization of the beta process, and we
study the power laws that can be obtained from this generalized beta process.
We present a posterior inference algorithm for the beta-Bernoulli process that
exploits the stick-breaking representation, and we present experimental results
for a discrete factor-analysis model.
