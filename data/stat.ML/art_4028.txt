Predicting User Roles in Social Networks using Transfer Learning with
  Feature Transformation
How can we recognise social roles of people, given a completely unlabelled
social network? We present a transfer learning approach to network role
classification based on feature transformations from each network's local
feature distribution to a global feature space. Experiments are carried out on
real-world datasets. (See manuscript for the full abstract.)
