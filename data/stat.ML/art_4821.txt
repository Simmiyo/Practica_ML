Fast Methods for Recovering Sparse Parameters in Linear Low Rank Models
In this paper, we investigate the recovery of a sparse weight vector
(parameters vector) from a set of noisy linear combinations. However, only
partial information about the matrix representing the linear combinations is
available. Assuming a low-rank structure for the matrix, one natural solution
would be to first apply a matrix completion on the data, and then to solve the
resulting compressed sensing problem. In big data applications such as massive
MIMO and medical data, the matrix completion step imposes a huge computational
burden. Here, we propose to reduce the computational cost of the completion
task by ignoring the columns corresponding to zero elements in the sparse
vector. To this end, we employ a technique to initially approximate the support
of the sparse vector. We further propose to unify the partial matrix completion
and sparse vector recovery into an augmented four-step problem. Simulation
results reveal that the augmented approach achieves the best performance, while
both proposed methods outperform the natural two-step technique with
substantially less computational requirements.
