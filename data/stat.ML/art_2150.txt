A concentration theorem for projections
X in R^D has mean zero and finite second moments. We show that there is a
precise sense in which almost all linear projections of X into R^d (for d < D)
look like a scale-mixture of spherical Gaussians -- specifically, a mixture of
distributions N(0, sigma^2 I_d) where the weight of the particular sigma
component is P (| X |^2 = sigma^2 D). The extent of this effect depends upon
the ratio of d to D, and upon a particular coefficient of eccentricity of X's
distribution. We explore this result in a variety of experiments.
