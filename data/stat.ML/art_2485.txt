Marginal AMP Chain Graphs
We present a new family of models that is based on graphs that may have
undirected, directed and bidirected edges. We name these new models marginal
AMP (MAMP) chain graphs because each of them is Markov equivalent to some AMP
chain graph under marginalization of some of its nodes. However, MAMP chain
graphs do not only subsume AMP chain graphs but also multivariate regression
chain graphs. We describe global and pairwise Markov properties for MAMP chain
graphs and prove their equivalence for compositional graphoids. We also
characterize when two MAMP chain graphs are Markov equivalent.
  For Gaussian probability distributions, we also show that every MAMP chain
graph is Markov equivalent to some directed and acyclic graph with
deterministic nodes under marginalization and conditioning on some of its
nodes. This is important because it implies that the independence model
represented by a MAMP chain graph can be accounted for by some data generating
process that is partially observed and has selection bias. Finally, we modify
MAMP chain graphs so that they are closed under marginalization for Gaussian
probability distributions. This is a desirable feature because it guarantees
parsimonious models under marginalization.
