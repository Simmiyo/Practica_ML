Mini-Batch Spectral Clustering
The cost of computing the spectrum of Laplacian matrices hinders the
application of spectral clustering to large data sets. While approximations
recover computational tractability, they can potentially affect clustering
performance. This paper proposes a practical approach to learn spectral
clustering based on adaptive stochastic gradient optimization. Crucially, the
proposed approach recovers the exact spectrum of Laplacian matrices in the
limit of the iterations, and the cost of each iteration is linear in the number
of samples. Extensive experimental validation on data sets with up to half a
million samples demonstrate its scalability and its ability to outperform
state-of-the-art approximate methods to learn spectral clustering for a given
computational budget.
