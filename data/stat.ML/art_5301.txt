Adversarial examples for generative models
We explore methods of producing adversarial examples on deep generative
models such as the variational autoencoder (VAE) and the VAE-GAN. Deep learning
architectures are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, but previous
work has focused on the application of adversarial examples to classification
tasks. Deep generative models have recently become popular due to their ability
to model input data distributions and generate realistic examples from those
distributions. We present three classes of attacks on the VAE and VAE-GAN
architectures and demonstrate them against networks trained on MNIST, SVHN and
CelebA. Our first attack leverages classification-based adversaries by
attaching a classifier to the trained encoder of the target generative model,
which can then be used to indirectly manipulate the latent representation. Our
second attack directly uses the VAE loss function to generate a target
reconstruction image from the adversarial example. Our third attack moves
beyond relying on classification or the standard loss for the gradient and
directly optimizes against differences in source and target latent
representations. We also motivate why an attacker might be interested in
deploying such techniques against a target generative network.
