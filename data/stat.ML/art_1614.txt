Tree Exploration for Bayesian RL Exploration
Research in reinforcement learning has produced algorithms for optimal
decision making under uncertainty that fall within two main types. The first
employs a Bayesian framework, where optimality improves with increased
computational time. This is because the resulting planning task takes the form
of a dynamic programming problem on a belief tree with an infinite number of
states. The second type employs relatively simple algorithm which are shown to
suffer small regret within a distribution-free framework. This paper presents a
lower bound and a high probability upper bound on the optimal value function
for the nodes in the Bayesian belief tree, which are analogous to similar
bounds in POMDPs. The bounds are then used to create more efficient strategies
for exploring the tree. The resulting algorithms are compared with the
distribution-free algorithm UCB1, as well as a simpler baseline algorithm on
multi-armed bandit problems.
