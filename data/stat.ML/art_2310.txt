Learning Continuous Time Bayesian Networks
Continuous time Bayesian networks (CTBNs) describe structured stochastic
processes with finitely many states that evolve over continuous time. A CTBN is
a directed (possibly cyclic) dependency graph over a set of variables, each of
which represents a finite state continuous time Markov process whose transition
model is a function of its parents. We address the problem of learning
parameters and structure of a CTBN from fully observed data. We define a
conjugate prior for CTBNs, and show how it can be used both for Bayesian
parameter estimation and as the basis of a Bayesian score for structure
learning. Because acyclicity is not a constraint in CTBNs, we can show that the
structure learning problem is significantly easier, both in theory and in
practice, than structure learning for dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs).
Furthermore, as CTBNs can tailor the parameters and dependency structure to the
different time granularities of the evolution of different variables, they can
provide a better fit to continuous-time processes than DBNs with a fixed time
granularity.
