Active Learning of Linear Embeddings for Gaussian Processes
We propose an active learning method for discovering low-dimensional
structure in high-dimensional Gaussian process (GP) tasks. Such problems are
increasingly frequent and important, but have hitherto presented severe
practical difficulties. We further introduce a novel technique for
approximately marginalizing GP hyperparameters, yielding marginal predictions
robust to hyperparameter mis-specification. Our method offers an efficient
means of performing GP regression, quadrature, or Bayesian optimization in
high-dimensional spaces.
