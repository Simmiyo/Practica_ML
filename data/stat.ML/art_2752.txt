Coordinate Descent with Online Adaptation of Coordinate Frequencies
Coordinate descent (CD) algorithms have become the method of choice for
solving a number of optimization problems in machine learning. They are
particularly popular for training linear models, including linear support
vector machine classification, LASSO regression, and logistic regression.
  We consider general CD with non-uniform selection of coordinates. Instead of
fixing selection frequencies beforehand we propose an online adaptation
mechanism for this important parameter, called the adaptive coordinate
frequencies (ACF) method. This mechanism removes the need to estimate optimal
coordinate frequencies beforehand, and it automatically reacts to changing
requirements during an optimization run.
  We demonstrate the usefulness of our ACF-CD approach for a variety of
optimization problems arising in machine learning contexts. Our algorithm
offers significant speed-ups over state-of-the-art training methods.
