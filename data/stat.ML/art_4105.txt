A Benchmark and Comparison of Active Learning for Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is by far the most widely used classifier in real-world
applications. In this paper, we benchmark the state-of-the-art active learning
methods for logistic regression and discuss and illustrate their underlying
characteristics. Experiments are carried out on three synthetic datasets and 44
real-world datasets, providing insight into the behaviors of these active
learning methods with respect to the area of the learning curve (which plots
classification accuracy as a function of the number of queried examples) and
their computational costs. Surprisingly, one of the earliest and simplest
suggested active learning methods, i.e., uncertainty sampling, performs
exceptionally well overall. Another remarkable finding is that random sampling,
which is the rudimentary baseline to improve upon, is not overwhelmed by
individual active learning techniques in many cases.
