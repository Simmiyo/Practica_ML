Kernel Bayes' rule
A nonparametric kernel-based method for realizing Bayes' rule is proposed,
based on representations of probabilities in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.
Probabilities are uniquely characterized by the mean of the canonical map to
the RKHS. The prior and conditional probabilities are expressed in terms of
RKHS functions of an empirical sample: no explicit parametric model is needed
for these quantities. The posterior is likewise an RKHS mean of a weighted
sample. The estimator for the expectation of a function of the posterior is
derived, and rates of consistency are shown. Some representative applications
of the kernel Bayes' rule are presented, including Baysian computation without
likelihood and filtering with a nonparametric state-space model.
