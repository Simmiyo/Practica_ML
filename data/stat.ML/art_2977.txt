Stretchy Polynomial Regression
This article proposes a novel solution for stretchy polynomial regression
learning. The solution comes in primal and dual closed-forms similar to that of
ridge regression. Essentially, the proposed solution stretches the covariance
computation via a power term thereby compresses or amplifies the estimation.
Our experiments on both synthetic data and real-world data show effectiveness
of the proposed method for compressive learning.
