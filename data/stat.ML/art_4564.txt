Optimally Pruning Decision Tree Ensembles With Feature Cost
We consider the problem of learning decision rules for prediction with
feature budget constraint. In particular, we are interested in pruning an
ensemble of decision trees to reduce expected feature cost while maintaining
high prediction accuracy for any test example. We propose a novel 0-1 integer
program formulation for ensemble pruning. Our pruning formulation is general -
it takes any ensemble of decision trees as input. By explicitly accounting for
feature-sharing across trees together with accuracy/cost trade-off, our method
is able to significantly reduce feature cost by pruning subtrees that introduce
more loss in terms of feature cost than benefit in terms of prediction accuracy
gain. Theoretically, we prove that a linear programming relaxation produces the
exact solution of the original integer program. This allows us to use efficient
convex optimization tools to obtain an optimally pruned ensemble for any given
budget. Empirically, we see that our pruning algorithm significantly improves
the performance of the state of the art ensemble method BudgetRF.
