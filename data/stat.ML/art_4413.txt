Deep Video Generation, Prediction and Completion of Human Action
  Sequences
Current deep learning results on video generation are limited while there are
only a few first results on video prediction and no relevant significant
results on video completion. This is due to the severe ill-posedness inherent
in these three problems. In this paper, we focus on human action videos, and
propose a general, two-stage deep framework to generate human action videos
with no constraints or arbitrary number of constraints, which uniformly address
the three problems: video generation given no input frames, video prediction
given the first few frames, and video completion given the first and last
frames. To make the problem tractable, in the first stage we train a deep
generative model that generates a human pose sequence from random noise. In the
second stage, a skeleton-to-image network is trained, which is used to generate
a human action video given the complete human pose sequence generated in the
first stage. By introducing the two-stage strategy, we sidestep the original
ill-posed problems while producing for the first time high-quality video
generation/prediction/completion results of much longer duration. We present
quantitative and qualitative evaluation to show that our two-stage approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in video generation, prediction and video
completion. Our video result demonstration can be viewed at
