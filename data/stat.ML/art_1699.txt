Variational approximation for heteroscedastic linear models and matching
  pursuit algorithms
Modern statistical applications involving large data sets have focused
attention on statistical methodologies which are both efficient computationally
and able to deal with the screening of large numbers of different candidate
models. Here we consider computationally efficient variational Bayes approaches
to inference in high-dimensional heteroscedastic linear regression, where both
the mean and variance are described in terms of linear functions of the
predictors and where the number of predictors can be larger than the sample
size. We derive a closed form variational lower bound on the log marginal
likelihood useful for model selection, and propose a novel fast greedy search
algorithm on the model space which makes use of one step optimization updates
to the variational lower bound in the current model for screening large numbers
of candidate predictor variables for inclusion/exclusion in a computationally
thrifty way. We show that the model search strategy we suggest is related to
widely used orthogonal matching pursuit algorithms for model search but yields
a framework for potentially extending these algorithms to more complex models.
The methodology is applied in simulations and in two real examples involving
prediction for food constituents using NIR technology and prediction of disease
progression in diabetes.
