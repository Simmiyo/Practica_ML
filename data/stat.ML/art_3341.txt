Optimal Decision-Theoretic Classification Using Non-Decomposable
  Performance Metrics
We provide a general theoretical analysis of expected out-of-sample utility,
also referred to as decision-theoretic classification, for non-decomposable
binary classification metrics such as F-measure and Jaccard coefficient. Our
key result is that the expected out-of-sample utility for many performance
metrics is provably optimized by a classifier which is equivalent to a signed
thresholding of the conditional probability of the positive class. Our analysis
bridges a gap in the literature on binary classification, revealed in light of
recent results for non-decomposable metrics in population utility maximization
style classification. Our results identify checkable properties of a
performance metric which are sufficient to guarantee a probability ranking
principle. We propose consistent estimators for optimal expected out-of-sample
classification. As a consequence of the probability ranking principle,
computational requirements can be reduced from exponential to cubic complexity
in the general case, and further reduced to quadratic complexity in special
cases. We provide empirical results on simulated and benchmark datasets
evaluating the performance of the proposed algorithms for decision-theoretic
classification and comparing them to baseline and state-of-the-art methods in
population utility maximization for non-decomposable metrics.
