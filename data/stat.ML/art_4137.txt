Embedding Feature Selection for Large-scale Hierarchical Classification
Large-scale Hierarchical Classification (HC) involves datasets consisting of
thousands of classes and millions of training instances with high-dimensional
features posing several big data challenges. Feature selection that aims to
select the subset of discriminant features is an effective strategy to deal
with large-scale HC problem. It speeds up the training process, reduces the
prediction time and minimizes the memory requirements by compressing the total
size of learned model weight vectors. Majority of the studies have also shown
feature selection to be competent and successful in improving the
classification accuracy by removing irrelevant features. In this work, we
investigate various filter-based feature selection methods for dimensionality
reduction to solve the large-scale HC problem. Our experimental evaluation on
text and image datasets with varying distribution of features, classes and
instances shows upto 3x order of speed-up on massive datasets and upto 45% less
memory requirements for storing the weight vectors of learned model without any
significant loss (improvement for some datasets) in the classification
accuracy. Source Code: https://cs.gmu.edu/~mlbio/featureselection.
