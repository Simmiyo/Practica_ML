Probabilistic Clustering of Time-Evolving Distance Data
We present a novel probabilistic clustering model for objects that are
represented via pairwise distances and observed at different time points. The
proposed method utilizes the information given by adjacent time points to find
the underlying cluster structure and obtain a smooth cluster evolution. This
approach allows the number of objects and clusters to differ at every time
point, and no identification on the identities of the objects is needed.
Further, the model does not require the number of clusters being specified in
advance -- they are instead determined automatically using a Dirichlet process
prior. We validate our model on synthetic data showing that the proposed method
is more accurate than state-of-the-art clustering methods. Finally, we use our
dynamic clustering model to analyze and illustrate the evolution of brain
cancer patients over time.
