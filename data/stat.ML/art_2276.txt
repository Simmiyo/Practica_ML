Sparse Q-learning with Mirror Descent
This paper explores a new framework for reinforcement learning based on
online convex optimization, in particular mirror descent and related
algorithms. Mirror descent can be viewed as an enhanced gradient method,
particularly suited to minimization of convex functions in highdimensional
spaces. Unlike traditional gradient methods, mirror descent undertakes gradient
updates of weights in both the dual space and primal space, which are linked
together using a Legendre transform. Mirror descent can be viewed as a proximal
algorithm where the distance generating function used is a Bregman divergence.
A new class of proximal-gradient based temporal-difference (TD) methods are
presented based on different Bregman divergences, which are more powerful than
regular TD learning. Examples of Bregman divergences that are studied include
p-norm functions, and Mahalanobis distance based on the covariance of sample
gradients. A new family of sparse mirror-descent reinforcement learning methods
are proposed, which are able to find sparse fixed points of an l1-regularized
Bellman equation at significantly less computational cost than previous methods
based on second-order matrix methods. An experimental study of mirror-descent
reinforcement learning is presented using discrete and continuous Markov
decision processes.
