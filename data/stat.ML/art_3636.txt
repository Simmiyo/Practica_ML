Mixtures of Sparse Autoregressive Networks
We consider high-dimensional distribution estimation through autoregressive
networks. By combining the concepts of sparsity, mixtures and parameter sharing
we obtain a simple model which is fast to train and which achieves
state-of-the-art or better results on several standard benchmark datasets.
Specifically, we use an L1-penalty to regularize the conditional distributions
and introduce a procedure for automatic parameter sharing between mixture
components. Moreover, we propose a simple distributed representation which
permits exact likelihood evaluations since the latent variables are interleaved
with the observable variables and can be easily integrated out. Our model
achieves excellent generalization performance and scales well to extremely high
dimensions.
