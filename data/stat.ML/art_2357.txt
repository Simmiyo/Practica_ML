Iterative Markov Chain Monte Carlo Computation of Reference Priors and
  Minimax Risk
We present an iterative Markov chainMonte Carlo algorithm for
computingreference priors and minimax risk forgeneral parametric families.
Ourapproach uses MCMC techniques based onthe Blahut-Arimoto algorithm
forcomputing channel capacity ininformation theory. We give astatistical
analysis of the algorithm,bounding the number of samples requiredfor the
stochastic algorithm to closelyapproximate the deterministic algorithmin each
iteration. Simulations arepresented for several examples fromexponential
families. Although we focuson applications to reference priors andminimax risk,
the methods and analysiswe develop are applicable to a muchbroader class of
optimization problemsand iterative algorithms.
