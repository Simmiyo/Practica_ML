A direct method for estimating a causal ordering in a linear
  non-Gaussian acyclic model
Structural equation models and Bayesian networks have been widely used to
analyze causal relations between continuous variables. In such frameworks,
linear acyclic models are typically used to model the datagenerating process of
variables. Recently, it was shown that use of non-Gaussianity identifies a
causal ordering of variables in a linear acyclic model without using any prior
knowledge on the network structure, which is not the case with conventional
methods. However, existing estimation methods are based on iterative search
algorithms and may not converge to a correct solution in a finite number of
steps. In this paper, we propose a new direct method to estimate a causal
ordering based on non-Gaussianity. In contrast to the previous methods, our
algorithm requires no algorithmic parameters and is guaranteed to converge to
the right solution within a small fixed number of steps if the data strictly
follows the model.
