Asymptotically Independent Markov Sampling: a new MCMC scheme for
  Bayesian Inference
In Bayesian statistics, many problems can be expressed as the evaluation of
the expectation of a quantity of interest with respect to the posterior
distribution. Standard Monte Carlo method is often not applicable because the
encountered posterior distributions cannot be sampled directly. In this case,
the most popular strategies are the importance sampling method, Markov chain
Monte Carlo, and annealing. In this paper, we introduce a new scheme for
Bayesian inference, called Asymptotically Independent Markov Sampling (AIMS),
which is based on the above methods. We derive important ergodic properties of
AIMS. In particular, it is shown that, under certain conditions, the AIMS
algorithm produces a uniformly ergodic Markov chain. The choice of the free
parameters of the algorithm is discussed and recommendations are provided for
this choice, both theoretically and heuristically based. The efficiency of AIMS
is demonstrated with three numerical examples, which include both multi-modal
and higher-dimensional target posterior distributions.
