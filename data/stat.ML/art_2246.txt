A Bayesian Nonparametric Approach to Image Super-resolution
Super-resolution methods form high-resolution images from low-resolution
images. In this paper, we develop a new Bayesian nonparametric model for
super-resolution. Our method uses a beta-Bernoulli process to learn a set of
recurring visual patterns, called dictionary elements, from the data. Because
it is nonparametric, the number of elements found is also determined from the
data. We test the results on both benchmark and natural images, comparing with
several other models from the research literature. We perform large-scale human
evaluation experiments to assess the visual quality of the results. In a first
implementation, we use Gibbs sampling to approximate the posterior. However,
this algorithm is not feasible for large-scale data. To circumvent this, we
then develop an online variational Bayes (VB) algorithm. This algorithm finds
high quality dictionaries in a fraction of the time needed by the Gibbs
sampler.
