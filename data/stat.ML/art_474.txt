A General Stochastic Algorithmic Framework for Minimizing Expensive
  Black Box Objective Functions Based on Surrogate Models and Sensitivity
  Analysis
We are focusing on bound constrained global optimization problems, whose
objective functions are computationally expensive black-box functions and have
multiple local minima. The recently popular Metric Stochastic Response Surface
(MSRS) algorithm proposed by \cite{Regis2007SRBF} based on adaptive or
sequential learning based on response surfaces is revisited and further
extended for better performance in case of higher dimensional problems.
Specifically, we propose a new way to generate the candidate points which the
next function evaluation point is picked from according to the metric criteria,
based on a new definition of distance, and prove the global convergence of the
corresponding. Correspondingly, a more adaptive implementation of MSRS, named
"SO-SA", is presented. "SO-SA" is is more likely to perturb those most
sensitive coordinates when generating the candidate points, instead of
perturbing all coordinates simultaneously.
  Numerical experiments on both synthetic problems and real problems
demonstrate the advantages of our new algorithm, compared with many state of
the art alternatives.}
