A Novel Training Algorithm for HMMs with Partial and Noisy Access to the
  States
This paper proposes a new estimation algorithm for the parameters of an HMM
as to best account for the observed data. In this model, in addition to the
observation sequence, we have \emph{partial} and \emph{noisy} access to the
hidden state sequence as side information. This access can be seen as "partial
labeling" of the hidden states. Furthermore, we model possible mislabeling in
the side information in a joint framework and derive the corresponding EM
updates accordingly. In our simulations, we observe that using this side
information, we considerably improve the state recognition performance, up to
70%, with respect to the "achievable margin" defined by the baseline
algorithms. Moreover, our algorithm is shown to be robust to the training
conditions.
