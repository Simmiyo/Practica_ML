Morphology Generation for Statistical Machine Translation using Deep
  Learning Techniques
Morphology in unbalanced languages remains a big challenge in the context of
machine translation. In this paper, we propose to de-couple machine translation
from morphology generation in order to better deal with the problem. We
investigate the morphology simplification with a reasonable trade-off between
expected gain and generation complexity. For the Chinese-Spanish task, optimum
morphological simplification is in gender and number. For this purpose, we
design a new classification architecture which, compared to other standard
machine learning techniques, obtains the best results. This proposed
neural-based architecture consists of several layers: an embedding, a
convolutional followed by a recurrent neural network and, finally, ends with
sigmoid and softmax layers. We obtain classification results over 98% accuracy
in gender classification, over 93% in number classification, and an overall
translation improvement of 0.7 METEOR.
