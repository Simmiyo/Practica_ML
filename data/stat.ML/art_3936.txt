Improved Strongly Adaptive Online Learning using Coin Betting
This paper describes a new parameter-free online learning algorithm for
changing environments. In comparing against algorithms with the same time
complexity as ours, we obtain a strongly adaptive regret bound that is a factor
of at least $\sqrt{\log(T)}$ better, where $T$ is the time horizon. Empirical
results show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
learning with expert advice and metric learning scenarios.
