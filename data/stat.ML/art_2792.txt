A Robust Ensemble Approach to Learn From Positive and Unlabeled Data
  Using SVM Base Models
We present a novel approach to learn binary classifiers when only positive
and unlabeled instances are available (PU learning). This problem is routinely
cast as a supervised task with label noise in the negative set. We use an
ensemble of SVM models trained on bootstrap resamples of the training data for
increased robustness against label noise. The approach can be considered in a
bagging framework which provides an intuitive explanation for its mechanics in
a semi-supervised setting. We compared our method to state-of-the-art
approaches in simulations using multiple public benchmark data sets. The
included benchmark comprises three settings with increasing label noise: (i)
fully supervised, (ii) PU learning and (iii) PU learning with false positives.
Our approach shows a marginal improvement over existing methods in the second
setting and a significant improvement in the third.
