Online Learning with Multiple Operator-valued Kernels
We consider the problem of learning a vector-valued function f in an online
learning setting. The function f is assumed to lie in a reproducing Hilbert
space of operator-valued kernels. We describe two online algorithms for
learning f while taking into account the output structure. A first contribution
is an algorithm, ONORMA, that extends the standard kernel-based online learning
algorithm NORMA from scalar-valued to operator-valued setting. We report a
cumulative error bound that holds both for classification and regression. We
then define a second algorithm, MONORMA, which addresses the limitation of
pre-defining the output structure in ONORMA by learning sequentially a linear
combination of operator-valued kernels. Our experiments show that the proposed
algorithms achieve good performance results with low computational cost.
