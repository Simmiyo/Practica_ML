Consistency Analysis of an Empirical Minimum Error Entropy Algorithm
In this paper we study the consistency of an empirical minimum error entropy
(MEE) algorithm in a regression setting. We introduce two types of consistency.
The error entropy consistency, which requires the error entropy of the learned
function to approximate the minimum error entropy, is shown to be always true
if the bandwidth parameter tends to 0 at an appropriate rate. The regression
consistency, which requires the learned function to approximate the regression
function, however, is a complicated issue. We prove that the error entropy
consistency implies the regression consistency for homoskedastic models where
the noise is independent of the input variable. But for heteroskedastic models,
a counterexample is used to show that the two types of consistency do not
coincide. A surprising result is that the regression consistency is always
true, provided that the bandwidth parameter tends to infinity at an appropriate
rate. Regression consistency of two classes of special models is shown to hold
with fixed bandwidth parameter, which further illustrates the complexity of
regression consistency of MEE. Fourier transform plays crucial roles in our
analysis.
