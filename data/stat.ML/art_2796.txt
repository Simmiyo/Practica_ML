Hybrid SRL with Optimization Modulo Theories
Generally speaking, the goal of constructive learning could be seen as, given
an example set of structured objects, to generate novel objects with similar
properties. From a statistical-relational learning (SRL) viewpoint, the task
can be interpreted as a constraint satisfaction problem, i.e. the generated
objects must obey a set of soft constraints, whose weights are estimated from
the data. Traditional SRL approaches rely on (finite) First-Order Logic (FOL)
as a description language, and on MAX-SAT solvers to perform inference. Alas,
FOL is unsuited for con- structive problems where the objects contain a mixture
of Boolean and numerical variables. It is in fact difficult to implement, e.g.
linear arithmetic constraints within the language of FOL. In this paper we
propose a novel class of hybrid SRL methods that rely on Satisfiability Modulo
Theories, an alternative class of for- mal languages that allow to describe,
and reason over, mixed Boolean-numerical objects and constraints. The resulting
methods, which we call Learning Mod- ulo Theories, are formulated within the
structured output SVM framework, and employ a weighted SMT solver as an
optimization oracle to perform efficient in- ference and discriminative max
margin weight learning. We also present a few examples of constructive learning
applications enabled by our method.
