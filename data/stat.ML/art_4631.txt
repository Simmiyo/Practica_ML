Visualization of Jacques Lacan's Registers of the Psychoanalytic Field,
  and Discovery of Metaphor and of Metonymy. Analytical Case Study of Edgar
  Allan Poe's "The Purloined Letter"
We start with a description of Lacan's work that we then take into our
analytics methodology. In a first investigation, a Lacan-motivated template of
the Poe story is fitted to the data. A segmentation of the storyline is used in
order to map out the diachrony. Based on this, it will be shown how synchronous
aspects, potentially related to Lacanian registers, can be sought. This
demonstrates the effectiveness of an approach based on a model template of the
storyline narrative. In a second and more comprehensive investigation, we
develop an approach for revealing, that is, uncovering, Lacanian register
relationships. Objectives of this work include the wide and general application
of our methodology. This methodology is strongly based on the "letting the data
speak" Correspondence Analysis analytics platform of Jean-Paul Benz\'ecri, that
is also the geometric data analysis, both qualitative and quantitative
analytics, developed by Pierre Bourdieu.
