A unifying representation for a class of dependent random measures
We present a general construction for dependent random measures based on
thinning Poisson processes on an augmented space. The framework is not
restricted to dependent versions of a specific nonparametric model, but can be
applied to all models that can be represented using completely random measures.
Several existing dependent random measures can be seen as specific cases of
this framework. Interesting properties of the resulting measures are derived
and the efficacy of the framework is demonstrated by constructing a
covariate-dependent latent feature model and topic model that obtain superior
predictive performance.
