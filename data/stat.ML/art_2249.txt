Subset Selection for Gaussian Markov Random Fields
Given a Gaussian Markov random field, we consider the problem of selecting a
subset of variables to observe which minimizes the total expected squared
prediction error of the unobserved variables. We first show that finding an
exact solution is NP-hard even for a restricted class of Gaussian Markov random
fields, called Gaussian free fields, which arise in semi-supervised learning
and computer vision. We then give a simple greedy approximation algorithm for
Gaussian free fields on arbitrary graphs. Finally, we give a message passing
algorithm for general Gaussian Markov random fields on bounded tree-width
graphs.
