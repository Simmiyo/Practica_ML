Regularization for Matrix Completion
We consider the problem of reconstructing a low rank matrix from noisy
observations of a subset of its entries. This task has applications in
statistical learning, computer vision, and signal processing. In these
contexts, "noise" generically refers to any contribution to the data that is
not captured by the low-rank model. In most applications, the noise level is
large compared to the underlying signal and it is important to avoid
overfitting. In order to tackle this problem, we define a regularized cost
function well suited for spectral reconstruction methods. Within a random noise
model, and in the large system limit, we prove that the resulting accuracy
undergoes a phase transition depending on the noise level and on the fraction
of observed entries. The cost function can be minimized using OPTSPACE (a
manifold gradient descent algorithm). Numerical simulations show that this
approach is competitive with state-of-the-art alternatives.
