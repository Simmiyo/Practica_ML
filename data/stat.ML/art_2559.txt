Minimum Distance Estimation for Robust High-Dimensional Regression
We propose a minimum distance estimation method for robust regression in
sparse high-dimensional settings. The traditional likelihood-based estimators
lack resilience against outliers, a critical issue when dealing with
high-dimensional noisy data. Our method, Minimum Distance Lasso (MD-Lasso),
combines minimum distance functionals, customarily used in nonparametric
estimation for their robustness, with l1-regularization for high-dimensional
regression. The geometry of MD-Lasso is key to its consistency and robustness.
The estimator is governed by a scaling parameter that caps the influence of
outliers: the loss per observation is locally convex and close to quadratic for
small squared residuals, and flattens for squared residuals larger than the
scaling parameter. As the parameter approaches infinity, the estimator becomes
equivalent to least-squares Lasso. MD-Lasso enjoys fast convergence rates under
mild conditions on the model error distribution, which hold for any of the
solutions in a convexity region around the true parameter and in certain cases
for every solution. Remarkably, a first-order optimization method is able to
produce iterates very close to the consistent solutions, with geometric
convergence and regardless of the initialization. A connection is established
with re-weighted least-squares that intuitively explains MD-Lasso robustness.
The merits of our method are demonstrated through simulation and eQTL data
analysis.
