Bayesian Network Structure Learning with Permutation Tests
In literature there are several studies on the performance of Bayesian
network structure learning algorithms. The focus of these studies is almost
always the heuristics the learning algorithms are based on, i.e. the
maximisation algorithms (in score-based algorithms) or the techniques for
learning the dependencies of each variable (in constraint-based algorithms). In
this paper we investigate how the use of permutation tests instead of
parametric ones affects the performance of Bayesian network structure learning
from discrete data. Shrinkage tests are also covered to provide a broad
overview of the techniques developed in current literature.
