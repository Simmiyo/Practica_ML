Update Rules for Parameter Estimation in Bayesian Networks
This paper re-examines the problem of parameter estimation in Bayesian
networks with missing values and hidden variables from the perspective of
recent work in on-line learning [Kivinen & Warmuth, 1994]. We provide a unified
framework for parameter estimation that encompasses both on-line learning,
where the model is continuously adapted to new data cases as they arrive, and
the more traditional batch learning, where a pre-accumulated set of samples is
used in a one-time model selection process. In the batch case, our framework
encompasses both the gradient projection algorithm and the EM algorithm for
Bayesian networks. The framework also leads to new on-line and batch parameter
update schemes, including a parameterized version of EM. We provide both
empirical and theoretical results indicating that parameterized EM allows
faster convergence to the maximum likelihood parameters than does standard EM.
