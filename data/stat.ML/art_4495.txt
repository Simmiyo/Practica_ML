Generalized Risk-Aversion in Stochastic Multi-Armed Bandits
We consider the problem of minimizing the regret in stochastic multi-armed
bandit, when the measure of goodness of an arm is not the mean return, but some
general function of the mean and the variance.We characterize the conditions
under which learning is possible and present examples for which no natural
algorithm can achieve sublinear regret.
