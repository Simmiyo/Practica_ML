mS2GD: Mini-Batch Semi-Stochastic Gradient Descent in the Proximal
  Setting
We propose a mini-batching scheme for improving the theoretical complexity
and practical performance of semi-stochastic gradient descent applied to the
problem of minimizing a strongly convex composite function represented as the
sum of an average of a large number of smooth convex functions, and simple
nonsmooth convex function. Our method first performs a deterministic step
(computation of the gradient of the objective function at the starting point),
followed by a large number of stochastic steps. The process is repeated a few
times with the last iterate becoming the new starting point. The novelty of our
method is in introduction of mini-batching into the computation of stochastic
steps. In each step, instead of choosing a single function, we sample $b$
functions, compute their gradients, and compute the direction based on this. We
analyze the complexity of the method and show that the method benefits from two
speedup effects. First, we prove that as long as $b$ is below a certain
threshold, we can reach predefined accuracy with less overall work than without
mini-batching. Second, our mini-batching scheme admits a simple parallel
implementation, and hence is suitable for further acceleration by
parallelization.
