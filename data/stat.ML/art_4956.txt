A Strongly Quasiconvex PAC-Bayesian Bound
We propose a new PAC-Bayesian bound and a way of constructing a hypothesis
space, so that the bound is convex in the posterior distribution and also
convex in a trade-off parameter between empirical performance of the posterior
distribution and its complexity. The complexity is measured by the
Kullback-Leibler divergence to a prior. We derive an alternating procedure for
minimizing the bound. We show that the bound can be rewritten as a
one-dimensional function of the trade-off parameter and provide sufficient
conditions under which the function has a single global minimum. When the
conditions are satisfied the alternating minimization is guaranteed to converge
to the global minimum of the bound. We provide experimental results
demonstrating that rigorous minimization of the bound is competitive with
cross-validation in tuning the trade-off between complexity and empirical
performance. In all our experiments the trade-off turned to be quasiconvex even
when the sufficient conditions were violated.
