Dynamic trees for streaming and massive data contexts
Data collection at a massive scale is becoming ubiquitous in a wide variety
of settings, from vast offline databases to streaming real-time information.
Learning algorithms deployed in such contexts must rely on single-pass
inference, where the data history is never revisited. In streaming contexts,
learning must also be temporally adaptive to remain up-to-date against
unforeseen changes in the data generating mechanism. Although rapidly growing,
the online Bayesian inference literature remains challenged by massive data and
transient, evolving data streams. Non-parametric modelling techniques can prove
particularly ill-suited, as the complexity of the model is allowed to increase
with the sample size. In this work, we take steps to overcome these challenges
by porting standard streaming techniques, like data discarding and
downweighting, into a fully Bayesian framework via the use of informative
priors and active learning heuristics. We showcase our methods by augmenting a
modern non-parametric modelling framework, dynamic trees, and illustrate its
performance on a number of practical examples. The end product is a powerful
streaming regression and classification tool, whose performance compares
favourably to the state-of-the-art.
