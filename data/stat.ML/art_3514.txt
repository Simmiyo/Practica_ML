Minimum Spectral Connectivity Projection Pursuit
We study the problem of determining the optimal low dimensional projection
for maximising the separability of a binary partition of an unlabelled dataset,
as measured by spectral graph theory. This is achieved by finding projections
which minimise the second eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian of the projected
data, which corresponds to a non-convex, non-smooth optimisation problem. We
show that the optimal univariate projection based on spectral connectivity
converges to the vector normal to the maximum margin hyperplane through the
data, as the scaling parameter is reduced to zero. This establishes a
connection between connectivity as measured by spectral graph theory and
maximal Euclidean separation. The computational cost associated with each
eigen-problem is quadratic in the number of data. To mitigate this issue, we
propose an approximation method using microclusters with provable approximation
error bounds. Combining multiple binary partitions within a divisive
hierarchical model allows us to construct clustering solutions admitting
clusters with varying scales and lying within different subspaces. We evaluate
the performance of the proposed method on a large collection of benchmark
datasets and find that it compares favourably with existing methods for
projection pursuit and dimension reduction for data clustering.
