Bias Correction for Regularized Regression and its Application in
  Learning with Streaming Data
We propose an approach to reduce the bias of ridge regression and
regularization kernel network. When applied to a single data set the new
algorithms have comparable learning performance with the original ones. When
applied to incremental learning with block wise streaming data the new
algorithms are more efficient due to bias reduction. Both theoretical
characterizations and simulation studies are used to verify the effectiveness
of these new algorithms.
