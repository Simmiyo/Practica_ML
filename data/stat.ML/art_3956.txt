An Efficient Minibatch Acceptance Test for Metropolis-Hastings
We present a novel Metropolis-Hastings method for large datasets that uses
small expected-size minibatches of data. Previous work on reducing the cost of
Metropolis-Hastings tests yield variable data consumed per sample, with only
constant factor reductions versus using the full dataset for each sample. Here
we present a method that can be tuned to provide arbitrarily small batch sizes,
by adjusting either proposal step size or temperature. Our test uses the
noise-tolerant Barker acceptance test with a novel additive correction
variable. The resulting test has similar cost to a normal SGD update. Our
experiments demonstrate several order-of-magnitude speedups over previous work.
