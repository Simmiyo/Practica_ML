Learning Max-Margin Tree Predictors
Structured prediction is a powerful framework for coping with joint
prediction of interacting outputs. A central difficulty in using this framework
is that often the correct label dependence structure is unknown. At the same
time, we would like to avoid an overly complex structure that will lead to
intractable prediction. In this work we address the challenge of learning tree
structured predictive models that achieve high accuracy while at the same time
facilitate efficient (linear time) inference. We start by proving that this
task is in general NP-hard, and then suggest an approximate alternative.
Briefly, our CRANK approach relies on a novel Circuit-RANK regularizer that
penalizes non-tree structures and that can be optimized using a CCCP procedure.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several domains and show
that, despite the relative simplicity of the structure, prediction accuracy is
competitive with a fully connected model that is computationally costly at
prediction time.
