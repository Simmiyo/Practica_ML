Support vector comparison machines
In ranking problems, the goal is to learn a ranking function from labeled
pairs of input points. In this paper, we consider the related comparison
problem, where the label indicates which element of the pair is better, or if
there is no significant difference. We cast the learning problem as a margin
maximization, and show that it can be solved by converting it to a standard
SVM. We use simulated nonlinear patterns, a real learning to rank sushi data
set, and a chess data set to show that our proposed SVMcompare algorithm
outperforms SVMrank when there are equality pairs.
