Towards Better Analysis of Machine Learning Models: A Visual Analytics
  Perspective
Interactive model analysis, the process of understanding, diagnosing, and
refining a machine learning model with the help of interactive visualization,
is very important for users to efficiently solve real-world artificial
intelligence and data mining problems. Dramatic advances in big data analytics
has led to a wide variety of interactive model analysis tasks. In this paper,
we present a comprehensive analysis and interpretation of this rapidly
developing area. Specifically, we classify the relevant work into three
categories: understanding, diagnosis, and refinement. Each category is
exemplified by recent influential work. Possible future research opportunities
are also explored and discussed.
