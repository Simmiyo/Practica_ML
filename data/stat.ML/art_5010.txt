TristouNet: Triplet Loss for Speaker Turn Embedding
TristouNet is a neural network architecture based on Long Short-Term Memory
recurrent networks, meant to project speech sequences into a fixed-dimensional
euclidean space. Thanks to the triplet loss paradigm used for training, the
resulting sequence embeddings can be compared directly with the euclidean
distance, for speaker comparison purposes. Experiments on short (between 500ms
and 5s) speech turn comparison and speaker change detection show that
TristouNet brings significant improvements over the current state-of-the-art
techniques for both tasks.
