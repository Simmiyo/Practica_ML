Degrees of Freedom in Deep Neural Networks
In this paper, we explore degrees of freedom in deep sigmoidal neural
networks. We show that the degrees of freedom in these models is related to the
expected optimism, which is the expected difference between test error and
training error. We provide an efficient Monte-Carlo method to estimate the
degrees of freedom for multi-class classification methods. We show degrees of
freedom are lower than the parameter count in a simple XOR network. We extend
these results to neural nets trained on synthetic and real data, and
investigate impact of network's architecture and different regularization
choices. The degrees of freedom in deep networks are dramatically smaller than
the number of parameters, in some real datasets several orders of magnitude.
Further, we observe that for fixed number of parameters, deeper networks have
less degrees of freedom exhibiting a regularization-by-depth.
