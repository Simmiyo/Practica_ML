On the cohomology of sl(m+1,R) acting on differential operators and
  sl(m+1,R)-equivariant symbol
One computes the cohomology of the projective embedding of sl(m+1,R) acting
on the differential operators on densities on R^m of various weights. This
cohomology is non vanishing only for some special critical values of the
weights. This allows us first to explain some strange feature pointed out by
Gargoubi in his classification if the module of differential operators on the
line. This also allows us to provide a so called sl(m+1,R) invariant symbol for
differential operators acting on densities of non critical weights.
