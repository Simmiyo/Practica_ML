Homotopy Groups, Focal Points and Totally Geodesic Immersions
In this paper we consider on a complete Riemannian manifold $M$ an immersed
totally geodesic hypersurface $\Si$ existing together with an immersed
submanifold $N$ without focal points. No curvature condition is needed. We
obtained several connectedness results relating the topologies of $M$ and $\Si$
which depend on the codimension of $N$.
