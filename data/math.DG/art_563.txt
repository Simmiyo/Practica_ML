Nearly Kaehler geometry and Riemannian foliations
We consider strict and complete nearly Kaehler manifolds with the canonical
Hermitian connection. The holonomy representation of the canonical Hermitian
connection is studied. We show that a strict and complete nearly Kaehler is
locally a Riemannian product of homogenous nearly Kaehler spaces, twistor
spaces over quaternionic Kaehler manifolds and 6-dimensional nearly Kaehler
manifolds. As an application we obtain structure results for totally geodesic
Riemannian foliations admitting a compatible Kaehler structure. Finally, we
obtain a classification result for the homogenous case, reducing a conjecture
of Wolf and Gray to its 6-dimensional form.
