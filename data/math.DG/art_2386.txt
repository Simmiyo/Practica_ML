A family of conformally flat Hamiltonian-minimal Lagrangian tori in
  $\mathbb{CP}^3$
In this paper by reduction we construct a family of conformally flat
Hamiltonian-minimal Lagrangian tori in $\mathbb{CP}^3$ as the image of the
composition of the Hopf map $\mathcal{H}: \mathbb{S}^7\to \mathbb{CP}^3$ and a
map $\psi:\mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{S}^7$ with certain conditions.
