On basic curvature identities for almost (para)contact metric manifolds
In monograph of D. E. Blair "Riemannian geometry of contact and symplectic
manifolds" and in the paper of S. Zamkovoy "Canonical connections on
paracontact manifolds", the curvature identities respectively for contact and
paracontact metric manifold are proved. We obtain the curvature identity in the
wider class of manifolds, which generalizes results presented in above
mentioned publications. Moreover, we present some properties of almost
(para)hermitian structure on a special semiproduct of R+ and an almost
(para)contact metric manifold. This semiproduct plays an auxiliary role in
proving main theorem.
