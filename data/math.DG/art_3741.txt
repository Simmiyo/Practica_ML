Locally conformally flat quasi-Einstein manifolds
In this paper we prove that any complete locally conformally flat
quasi-Einstein manifold of dimension $n\geq 3$ is locally a warped product with
$(n-1)$-dimensional fibers of constant curvature. This result includes also the
case of locally conformally flat gradient Ricci solitons.
