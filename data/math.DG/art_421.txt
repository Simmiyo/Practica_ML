Geodesics and curvature of semidirect product groups
Geodesics and curvature of semidirect product groups with right invariant
metrics are determined. In the special case of an isometric semidirect product,
the curvature is shown to be the sum of the curvature of the two groups. A
series of examples, like the magnetic extension of a group, are then
considered.
