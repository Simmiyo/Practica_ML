A Note on the Conformal Invariance of G-Generalized Gradients
We consider generalized gradients in the general context of $G$-structures.
They are natural first order differential operators acting on sections of
vector bundles associated to irreducible $G$-representations. We study their
geometric properties and show in particular their conformal invariance.
