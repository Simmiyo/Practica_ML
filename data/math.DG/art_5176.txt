Curvature of almost Hermitian manifolds and applications
In this paper, by introducing a notion of local quasi holomorphic frame, we
obtain a curvature formula for almost Hermitian manifolds which is similar to
that of Hermitian manifolds. Moreover, as applications of the curvature
formula, we extend a result of H.S. Wu and a result of F. Zheng to almost
Hermitian manifolds.
