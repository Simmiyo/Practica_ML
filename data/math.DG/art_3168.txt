Stable hypersurfaces with constant scalar curvature in Euclidean spaces
We obtain some nonexistence results for complete noncompact stable
hyppersurfaces with nonnegative constant scalar curvature in Euclidean spaces.
As a special case we prove that there is no complete noncompact strongly stable
hypersurface $M$ in $\mathbb{R}^{4}$ with zero scalar curvature $S_2$, nonzero
Gauss-Kronecker curvature and finite total curvature (i.e.
$\int_M|A|^3<+\infty$).
