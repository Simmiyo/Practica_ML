Constant mean curvature hypersurfaces condensing along a submanifold
Given any nondegenerate k-dimensional minimal submanifold K of codimension
greater than 1, we prove the existence of families of constant mean curvature
submanifolds, with mean curvature varying from one member of the family to
another, which `condense' to K. In particular, our result proves the existence
of constant mean curvature hypersurfaces with nontrivial topology in any
Riemannian manifold.
