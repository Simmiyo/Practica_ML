Rigidity and stability of Einstein metrics for quadratic curvature
  functionals
We investigate rigidity and stability properties of critical points of
quadratic curvature functionals on the space of Riemannian metrics. We show it
is possible to "gauge" the Euler-Lagrange equations, in a self-adjoint fashion,
to become elliptic. Fredholm theory may then be used to describe local
properties of the moduli space of critical metrics. We show a number of compact
examples are infinitesimally rigid, and consequently, are isolated critical
points in the space of unit-volume Riemannian metrics. We then give examples of
critical metrics which are strict local minimizers (up to diffeomorphism and
scaling). A corollary is a local "reverse Bishop's inequality" for such
metrics. In particular, any metric $g$ in a $C^{2,\alpha}$-neighborhood of the
round metric $(S^n,g_S)$ satisfying $Ric(g) \leq Ric(g_S)$ has volume $Vol(g)
\geq Vol(g_S)$, with equality holding if and only if $g$ is isometric to $g_S$.
