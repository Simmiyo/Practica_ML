Comparison Geometry for the Bakry-Emery Ricci Tensor
For Riemannian manifolds with a measure $(M,g, e^{-f} dvol_g)$ we prove mean
curvature and volume comparison results when the $\infty$-Bakry-Emery Ricci
tensor is bounded from below and $f$ is bounded or $\partial_r f$ is bounded
from below, generalizing the classical ones (i.e. when $f$ is constant). This
leads to extensions of many theorems for Ricci curvature bounded below to the
Bakry-Emery Ricci tensor. In particular, we give extensions of all of the major
comparison theorems when $f$ is bounded. Simple examples show the bound on $f$
is necessary for these results.
