Smooth Yamabe invariant and surgery
We prove a surgery formula for the smooth Yamabe invariant $\sigma(M)$ of a
compact manifold $M$. Assume that $N$ is obtained from $M$ by surgery of
codimension at least 3. We prove the existence of a positive number
$\Lambda_n$, depending only on the dimension $n$ of $M$, such that $$ \sigma(N)
\geq \min{\sigma(M),\Lambda_n}. $$
