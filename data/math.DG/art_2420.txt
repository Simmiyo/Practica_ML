When is a Connection a Levi-Civita Connection?
We consider the more general question as to when a connection is a metric
connection. There are two aspects to this investigation: first, the
determination of the integrability conditions that ensure the existence of a
local parallel metric in the neighbourhood of a given point and second, the
characterization of the topological obstruction to a globally defined parallel
metric.
