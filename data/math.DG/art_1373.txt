Some uniqueness results for constant mean curvature graphs
The aim of this paper is to give two uniqueness results for the Dirichlet
problem associated to the constant mean curvature equation. We study constant
mean curvature graphs over strips of R^2. The proofs are based on height
estimates and the study of the asymptotic behaviour of solutions to the
Dirichlet problem.
