Isometric immersions of R^2 into R^4 and pertubation of Hopf tori
We produce a new general family of flat tori in R^4, the first one since
Bianchi's classical works in the 19th century. To construct these flat tori,
obtained via small perturbation of certain Hopf tori in S^3, we first present a
global description of all isometric immersions of R^2 into R^4 with flat normal
bundle.
