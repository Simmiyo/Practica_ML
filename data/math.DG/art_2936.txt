Definable triangulations with regularity conditions
In this paper we prove that every definable set has a definable triangulation
which is locally Lipschitz and weakly bi-Lipschitz on the natural simplicial
stratification of the simplicial complex. We also distinguish a class T of
regularity conditions and give a universal construction of a definable
triangulation with a T condition of a definable set. This class includes the
Whitney (B) condition and the Verdier condition.
