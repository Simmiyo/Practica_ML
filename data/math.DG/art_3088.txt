On the irreducibility of locally metric connections
A locally metric connection on a smooth manifold $M$ is a torsion-free
connection $D$ on $TM$ with compact restricted holonomy group
$\mathrm{Hol}_0(D)$. If the holonomy representation of such a connection is
irreducible, then $D$ preserves a conformal structure on $M$. Under some
natural geometric assumption on the life-time of incomplete geodesics, we prove
that conversely, a locally metric connection $D$ preserving a conformal
structure on a compact manifold $M$ has irreducible holonomy representation,
unless $\mathrm{Hol}_0(D)=0$ or $D$ is the Levi-Civita connection of a
Riemannian metric on $M$. This result generalizes Gallot's theorem on the
irreducibility of Riemannian cones to a much wider class of connections. As an
application, we give the geometric description of compact conformal manifolds
carrying a tame closed Weyl connection with non-generic holonomy.
