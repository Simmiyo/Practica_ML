Verdier stratifications and [wf]-stratification in o-minimal structures
We prove the existence of Verdier stratifications for sets definable in any
o-minimal structure on (R, +, .). It is also shown that the Verdier condition
(w) implies the Whitney condition (b) in o-minimal structures on (R, +, .). As
a consequence the Whitney Stratification Theorem holds. The existence of
(wf)-stratification of functions definable in polynomially bounded o-minimal
structures is presented.
