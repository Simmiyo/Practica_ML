The space of Constant Mean Curvature surfaces in compact Riemannian
  Manifolds
The main point of this paper is that, under suitable conditions on the mean
curvature and the Ricci curvature of the ambient space, we can extend
Choi-Schoen's Compactness Theorem to compact embedded minimal surfaces to
simple immersed compact H-surfaces in a Riemannian manifold with positive Ricci
curvature (the mean curvature small depending on the Ricci curvature). Also, we
prove that the space of convex embedded (fixed) constant mean curvature
hypersurfaces in a simply connected 1/4-pinched manifold is compact.
