Locally Conformally Flat Lorentzian Gradient Ricci Solitons
It is shown that locally conformally flat Lorentzian gradient Ricci solitons
are locally isometric to a Robertson-Walker warped product, if the gradient of
the potential function is non null, and to a plane wave, if the gradient of the
potential function is null. The latter gradient Ricci solitons are necessarily
steady.
