On models of non-Eucludian spaces generated by associative algebras
We present the non-trivial example how to generate non-Euclidean geometries
from associative unital algebras. We consider bundles of the sphere of the
degenerate non-Eucleadian space and its two models. The first (conformal) model
is obtained by the mapping S onto a plane pass through the origin. It is
analogous to the stereographic mapping. The second model (projective) is con-
structed by the Norden normalization method, where we project the sphere onto a
plane of normalization defining the metric and Christoffel symbols which allow
us to find geodesic curves.
