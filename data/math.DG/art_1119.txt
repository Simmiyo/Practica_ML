Killing forms on G2 and Spin7 manifolds
Killing forms on Riemannian manifolds are differential forms whose covariant
derivative is totally skew-symmetric. We show that on a compact manifold with
holonomy G2 or Spin7 any Killing form has to be parallel. The main tool is a
universal Weitzenboeck formula. We show how such a formula can be obtained for
any given holonomy group and any representation defining a vector bundle.
