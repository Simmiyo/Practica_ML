Kähler-Ricci Flow with Degenerate Initial Class
In an earlier work joint with X. X. Chen and G. Tian, we introduced the weak
K\"ahler-Ricci flow for various geometric motivations. In the current work, we
take further consideration on setting up the weak flow. Namely, the initial
class is allowed to be no longer K\"ahler.
