The fundamental theorems for curves and surfaces in 3d Heisenberg group
We study the local equivalence problems of curves and surfaces in three
dimensional Heisenberg group via Cartans method of moving frames and Lie
groups, and find a complete set of invariants for curves and surfaces. For
surfaces, in terms of these invariants and their suitable derivatives, we also
give a Gaussian curvature fromula of the metric induced from the adapted metric
on Heisenberg group, and hence form a new formula for the Euler number of a
closed surface.
