The gap phenomenon in parabolic geometries
The infinitesimal symmetry algebra of any Cartan geometry has maximum
dimension realized by the flat model, but often this dimension drops
significantly when considering non-flat geometries, so a gap phenomenon arises.
For general (regular, normal) parabolic geometries of type (G,P), we use Tanaka
theory to derive a universal upper bound on the submaximal symmetry dimension.
We use Kostant's version of the Bott-Borel-Weil theorem to show that this bound
is in fact sharp in almost all complex and split-real cases by exhibiting
(abstract) models. We explicitly compute all submaximal symmetry dimensions
when G is any complex or split-real simple Lie group.
