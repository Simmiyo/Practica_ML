Mabuchi and Aubin-Yau functionals over complex manifolds
In the previous papers \cite{L1, L2} the author constructed Mabuchi and
Aubin-Yau functionals over any complex surfaces and three-folds, respectively.
Using the method in \cite{L2}, we construct those functionals over any complex
manifolds of the complex dimension bigger than or equal to 2.
