Realisation of special Kaehler manifolds as parabolic spheres
We prove that any simply connected special Kaehler manifold admits a
canonical immersion as a parabolic affine hypersphere. As an application, we
associate a parabolic affine hypersphere to any nondegenerate holomorphic
function. Also we show that a classical result of Calabi and Pogorelov on
parabolic spheres implies Lu's theorem on complete special Kaehler manifolds
with a positive definite metric.
