Nonexistence of invariant distributions supported on the limit set
We obtain sufficient conditions exlcuding the existence of non-trivial
distribution sections of bundles over the boundary of symmetric spaces of
negative curvature which are invariant with respect to a geometrically finite
group of isometries and are supported on the limit set in a strong sense.
