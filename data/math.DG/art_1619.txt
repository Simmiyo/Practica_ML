On weighted L^2 cohomology
Consider a complete orientable manifold with countably many components of
bounded dimension. Suppose that its rational homology is infinitely generated
in some degree. Then there is no choice of weight function for which the
natural map from weighted L^2 cohomology to de Rham cohomology is surjective in
that degree.
