Harmonic morphisms with one-dimensional fibres on Einstein manifolds
We prove that, from an Einstein manifold of dimension greater than or equal
to five, there are just two types of harmonic morphism with one-dimensional
fibres. This generalizes a result of R.L. Bryant who obtained the same
conclusion under the assumption that the domain has constant curvature.
