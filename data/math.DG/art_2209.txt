Affine Geometry of Space Curves
This paper is devoted to the complete classification of space curves under
affine transformations in the view of Cartan's theorem. Spivak has introduced
the method but has not found the invariants. Furthermore, for the first time,
we propound a necessary and sufficient condition for the invariants. Then, we
study the shapes of space curves with constant curvatures in detail and suggest
their applications in physics, computer vision and image processing.
