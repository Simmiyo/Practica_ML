Minimal Surfaces with Catenoid Ends
In this paper, we use the conjugate surface construction to prove the
existence of certain non-periodic symmetric immersed minimal surfaces. These
surfaces have finite total curvature and embedded catenoid ends, and they have
positive genus yet maintain the symmetry of their genus-zero counterparts
constructed by Jorge-Meeks and Xu.
