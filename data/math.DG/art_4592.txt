Hypersurfaces with null higher order anisotropic mean curvature
Given a positive function $F$ on $\mathbb S^n$ which satisfies a convexity
condition, for $1\leq r\leq n$, we define for hypersurfaces in
$\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ the $r$-th anisotropic mean curvature function $H_{r; F}$, a
generalization of the usual $r$-th mean curvature function. We call a
hypersurface is anisotropic minimal if $H_F=H_{1; F}=0$, and anisotropic
$r$-minimal if $H_{r+1; F}=0$. Let $W$ be the set of points which are omitted
by the hyperplanes tangent to $M$. We will prove that if an oriented
hypersurface $M$ is anisotropic minimal, and the set $W$ is open and non-empty,
then $x(M)$ is a part of a hyperplane of $\mathbb R^{n+1}$. We also prove that
if an oriented hypersurface $M$ is anisotropic $r$-minimal and its $r$-th
anisotropic mean curvature $H_{r; F}$ is nonzero everywhere, and the set $W$ is
open and non-empty, then $M$ has anisotropic relative nullity $n-r$.
