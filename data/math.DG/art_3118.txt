Parabolic Symmetric Spaces
We study here systems of symmetries on $|1|$--graded parabolic geometries. We
are interested in smooth systems of symmetries and we discuss non--flat
homogeneous $|1|$--graded geometries. We show the existence of an invariant
admissible affine connection under quite weak condition on the system.
