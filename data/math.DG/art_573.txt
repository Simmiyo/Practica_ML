Géométrie des groupes oscillateurs et variétés localement
  symétriques
The Oscillator Groups,$\G_\lambda,$ are the only solvable, non commutative,
simply connected Lie groups to admit a Lorentzian bi-invariant metric. For
these groups, we give sufficient conditions for a left-invariant
pseudo-Riemannian metric to be complete, we determine the group of isometries,
we exhibit a left-invariant affine structure and prove that it is not
Lorentzian. As an application, we provide new examples of compact
pseudo-Riemannian (sometimes Lorentzian) locally symmetric, occasionally
affine, manifolds, complete or incomplete.
