Constant higher order mean curvature hypersurfaces in Riemannian spaces
It is still an open question whether a compact embedded hypersurface in the
Euclidean space R^{n+1} with constant mean curvature and spherical boundary is
necessarily a hyperplanar ball or a spherical cap, even in the simplest case of
surfaces in R^3. In a recent paper the first and third authors have shown that
this is true for the case of hypersurfaces in R^{n+1} with constant scalar
curvature, and more generally, hypersurfaces with constant higher order r-mean
curvature, when r>1. In this paper we deal with some aspects of the classical
problem above, by considering it in a more general context. Specifically, our
starting general ambient space is an orientable Riemannian manifold, where we
will consider a general geometric configuration consisting of an immersed
hypersurface with boundary on an oriented hypersurface P. For such a geometric
configuration, we study the relationship between the geometry of the
hypersurface along its boundary and the geometry of its boundary as a
hypersurface of P, as well as the geometry of P. Our approach allows us to
derive, among others, interesting results for the case where the ambient space
has constant curvature. In particular, we are able to extend the previous
symmetry results to the case of hypersurfaces with constant higher order r-mean
curvature in the hyperbolic space and in the sphere.
