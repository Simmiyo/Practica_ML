The homology theory of Koszul-Vinberg algebroids and Poisson manifolds
  II
We deal with smooth real manifolds as well as complex analytic manifolds as
well. It is well known that the concept of star product is powerful enough to
produce all Poisson structures on real manifolds. According to [BdM] it is not
known whether holomorphic star products exist on complex analytic manifolds.
  The main purpose of this paper is to show that the concept of homology of
Koszul-Vinberg algebroids on smooth (resp. complex analytic) manifolds is an
effective tool to produce smooth (resp complex analytic) Poisson structures on
smooth (resp. complex analytic) manifolds. We also study some invariants of
contact structures which arise from the associated Koszul-Vinberg algebroids.
