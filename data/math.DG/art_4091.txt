Improved Chen-Ricci inequality for curvature-like tensors and its
  applications
We present Chen-Ricci inequality and improved Chen-Ricci inequality for
curvature like tensors. Applying our improved Chen-Ricci inequality we study
Lagrangian and Kaehlerian slant submanifolds of complex space forms and
C-totally real submanifolds of Sasakian space forms.
