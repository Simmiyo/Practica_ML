Clifford Homomorphisms and Higher Spin Dirac Operators
We present a generalization of the Clifford action for other representations
spaces of $Spin(n)$, which is called the Clifford homomorphism. Their
properties extend to the ones for the higher spin Dirac operators on spin
manifolds. In particular, we have general Bochner identities for them, and an
eigenvalue estimate of a Laplace type operator on any associated bundle.
