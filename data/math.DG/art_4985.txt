Holomorphic submersions of locally conformally Kähler manifolds
A locally conformally K\"ahler (LCK) manifold is a complex manifold covered
by a K\"ahler manifold, with the covering group acting by homotheties. We show
that if such a compact manifold X admits a holomorphic submersion with positive
dimensional fibers at least one of which is of K\"ahler type, then X is
globally conformally K\"ahler or biholomorphic, up to finite covers, to a
Vaisman manifold (i.e. a mapping torus over a circle, with Sasakian fibre). As
a consequence, we show that the product between a compact non-K\"ahler LCK and
a compact K\"ahler manifold cannot carry a LCK metric.
