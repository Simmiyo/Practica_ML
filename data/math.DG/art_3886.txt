Steady gradient soliton with curvature in L^1
We characterize complete nonnegatively curved steady gradient soliton with
curvature in L^1. We show that there are isometric to a product (R^2,g_{cigar})
times(R^{n-2}, eucl))/Gamma where Gamma is a Bieberbach group of rank n-2. We
prove also a similar local splitting result under weaker curvature assumptions.
