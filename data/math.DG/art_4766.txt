Lc helices and harmonic curvatures in space forms (hypersurface)
In n-dimensional Euclidean space E^n, harmonic curvatures of a non-degenerate
curve defined by \"Ozdamar and Hacisaliho\u{g}lu [4]. In this paper, We define
a new type of curves called LC helix when the angle between tangent of this
curve and LC parallel vector field in space form is constant. Furthermore,
several characterizations of these curves by using its harmonic curvatures are
obtained. Particularly, in the 3-dimensional spaceform we obtain the results
[5].
