Conformal vector fields on Finsler manifolds
Applying concepts and tools from classical tangent bundle geometry and using
the apparatus of the calculus along the tangent bundle projection ('pull-back
formalism'), first we enrich the known lists of the characterizations of affine
vector fields on a spray manifold and conformal vector fields on a Finsler
manifold. Second, we deduce consequences on vector fields on the underlying
manifold of a Finsler structure having one or two of the mentioned geometric
properties.
