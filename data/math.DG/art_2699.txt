A Natural Connection on (2,3) Sub-Riemannian Manifolds
We build an analogue for the Levi-Civita connection on Riemannian manifolds
for sub-Riemannian manfiolds modeled on the Heisenberg group. We demonstrate
some geometric properties of this connection to justify our choice and show
that this connection is unique in having these properties.
