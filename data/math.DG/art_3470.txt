On the axiom of spheres in Kahler geometry
It is known, that if a 2m-dimensional Kahler manifold satisfies the axiom of
holomorphic 2n-spheres (1<n<m) or the axiom of antiholomorphic n-spheres (2<n),
it is of constant holomorphic sectional curvature. In this paper the same
result is obtained under weaker assumptions.
