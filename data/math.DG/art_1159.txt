Bounds on primitives of differential forms and cofilling inequalities
We prove that on a Riemannian manifold, a smooth differential form has a
primitive with a given (functional) upper bound provided the necessary weighted
isoperimetric inequalities implied by Stokes are satisfied. We apply this to
prove a comparison predicted by Gromov between the cofilling function and the
filling area.
