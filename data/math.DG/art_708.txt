Solvable Pseudo-Riemannian Symmetric Spaces
We present an approach to solvable pseudo-Riemannian symmetric spaces based
on papers of M.Cahen, M.Parker and N.Wallach. Thereby we reproduce the
classification of solvable symmetric triples of Lorentzian signature $(1,n-1)$
and complete the case of signature $(2,n-2)$. Moreover we discuss the topology
of non-simply-connected symmetric spaces.
