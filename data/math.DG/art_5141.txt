Orientation and symmetries of Alexandrov spaces with applications in
  positive curvature
We develop two new tools for use in Alexandrov geometry: a theory of ramified
orientable double covers and a particularly useful version of the Slice Theorem
for actions of compact Lie groups. These tools are applied to the
classification of compact, positively curved Alexandrov spaces with maximal
symmetry rank.
