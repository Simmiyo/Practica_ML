Metrics that realize all Lorentzian holonomy algebras
All candidates to the weakly-irreducible not irreducible holonomy algebras of
Lorentzian manifolds are known. In the present paper metrics that realize all
these candidates as holonomy algebras are given. This completes the
classification of the Lorentzian holonomy algebras. Also new examples of
metrics with the holonomy algebras $g_2\zr\Real^7\subset\so(1,8)$ and
$\spin(7)\zr\Real^8\subset\so(1,9)$ are constructed.
