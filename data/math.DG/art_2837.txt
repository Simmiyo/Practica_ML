Scalar-flat Kähler orbifolds via quaternionic-complex reduction
We prove that any asymptotically locally Euclidean scalar-flat K\"ahler
4-orbifold whose isometry group contains a 2-torus is isometric, up to an
orbifold covering, to a quaternionic-complex quotient of a $k$-dimensional
quaternionic vector space by a $(k-1)$-torus. In order to do so, we first prove
that any compact anti-self-dual 4-orbifold with positive Euler characteristic
whose isometry group contains a 2-torus is conformally equivalent, up to an
orbifold covering, to a quaternionic quotient of $k$-dimensional quaternionic
projective space by a $(k-1)$-torus.
