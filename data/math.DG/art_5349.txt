Interior Geometry of Almost Contact Kählerian Manifolds
In this paper, the notion of an almost contact K\"ahlerian structure is
introduced. The interior geometry of almost contact K\"ahlerian spaces is
investigated. On the zero-curvature distribution of an almost contact metric
structure, as on the total space of a vector bundle, an almost contact
K\"ahlerian structure is obtained.
