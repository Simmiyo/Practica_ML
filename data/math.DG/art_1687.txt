Complex Osserman Algebraic Curvature Tensors and Clifford Families
We classify the algebraic curvature tensors which are both Osserman and
complex Osserman in all but a finite number of exceptional
dimensions.Information concerning the possible eigenvalue structures, which is
provided by methods of algebraic topology, plays a central role in the
analysis.
