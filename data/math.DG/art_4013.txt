The Puiseux Characteristic of a Goursat Germ
Germs of Goursat distributions can be classified according to a geometric
coding called an RVT code. Jean (1996) and Mormul (2004) have shown that this
coding carries precisely the same data as the small growth vector. Montgomery
and Zhitomirskii (2010) have shown that such germs correspond to finite jets of
Legendrian curve germs, and that the RVT coding corresponds to the classical
invariant in the singularity theory of planar curves: the Puiseux
characteristic. Here we derive a simple formula for the Puiseux characteristic
of the curve corresponding to a Goursat germ with given small growth vector.
The simplicity of our theorem (compared with the more complex algorithms
previously known) suggests a deeper connection between singularity theory and
the theory of nonholonomic distributions.
