A comparison result for radial solutions of the mean curvature equation
We establish two comparison results between the solutions of a class of mean
curvature equations and pieces of arcs of circles that satisfy the same Neumann
boundary condition. Finally we present a number of examples where our estimates
can be applied, some of them have a physical motivation.
