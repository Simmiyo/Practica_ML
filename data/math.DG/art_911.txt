Hyperkähler Nahm transform
Given two hyperk\"ahler manifolds $M$ and $N$ and a quaternionic instanton on
their product, a hyperk\"ahler Nahm transform can be defined, which maps
quaternionic instantons on $M$ to quaternionic instantons on $N$. This
construction includes the case of Nahm transform for periodic instantons on
$\bR^4$, the Fourier-Mukai transform for instantons on K3 surfaces, as well as
the Nahm transform for ALE instantons.
