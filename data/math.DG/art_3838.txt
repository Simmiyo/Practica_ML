Singularities of the asymptotic completion of developable Möbius
  strips
We prove that the asymptotic completion of a developable M\"obius strip in
Euclidean three-space must have at least one singular point other than cuspidal
edge singularities. Moreover, if the strip contains a closed geodesic, then the
number of such singular points is at least three. These lower bounds are both
sharp.
