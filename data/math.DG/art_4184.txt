Transversal infinitesimal automorphisms on Kähler foliations
Let F be a K\"ahler foliation on a compact Riemannian manifold M. we study
the properties of infinitesimal automorphisms on (M,F), and in particular we
concentrate on the transversal conformal field, transversal projective field
and transversally holomorphic field
