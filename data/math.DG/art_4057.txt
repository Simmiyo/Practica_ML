Principal bundles on compact complex manifolds with trivial tangent
  bundle
Let $G$ be a connected complex Lie group and $\Gamma\subset G$ a cocompact
lattice. Let $H$ be a complex Lie group. We prove that a holomorphic principal
$H$-bundle $E_H$ over $G/\Gamma$ admits a holomorphic connection if and only if
$E_H$ is invariant. If $G$ is simply connected, we show that a holomorphic
principal $H$-bundle $E_H$ over $G/\Gamma$ admits a flat holomorphic connection
if and only if $E_H$ is homogeneous.
