Groups of loops and hoops
The approaches to quantum field theories based in the so called loop
representation deserved much attention recently. In it, closed curves and
holonomies around them play a central role. In this framework the group of
loops and the group of hoops have been defined, the first one consisting in
closed curves quotient with the equivalence relation that identifies curves
differing in retraced segments, and the second one consisting in closed curves
quotient with the equivalence relation that identifies curves having the same
holonomy for every connection in a fiber bundle. The purpose of this paper is
to clarify the relation between hoops and loops, or in other words, to give a
description of the class of holonomy equivalent curves.
