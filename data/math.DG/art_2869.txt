Lifts of Lorentzian r- Paracontact Structure: A Geometrical Dynamics
  Meaning
The goal of this paper, using lifting theory it is to produce almost
paracomplex struc- tures on the tangent bundle of almost Lorentzian
r-paracontact manifold endowed with almost Lorentzian r-paracontact structure.
Finally, we discuss the effect over dynamics systems of the produced
geometrical structures.
