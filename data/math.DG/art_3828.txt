A_2-singularities of hypersurfaces with non-negative sectional curvature
  in Euclidean space
In a previous work, the authors gave a definition of `front bundles'. Using
this, we give a realization theorem for wave fronts in space forms, like as in
the fundamental theorem of surface theory. As an application, we investigate
the behavior of principal singular curvatures along A_2-singularities of
hypersurfaces with non-negative sectional curvature in Euclidean space.
