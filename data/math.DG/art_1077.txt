A Class of Kaehler Einstein Structures on the Nonzero Cotangent Bundle
  of a Space Form
We obtain a class of Kaehler Einstein structures on the nonzero cotangent
bundle of a Riemannian manifold of positive constant sectional curvature. The
obtained class of Kaehler Einstein structure depends on one essential
parameter, cannot have constant holomorphic sectional curvature and is not
locally symmetric.
