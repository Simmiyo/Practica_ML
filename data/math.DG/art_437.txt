One parameter fixed point theory and gradient flows of closed 1-forms
We use the one parameter fixed point theory of Geoghegan and Nicas to get
information about the closed orbit structure of transverse gradient flows of
closed 1-forms on a closed manifold M. We define a noncommutative zeta function
in an object related to the first Hochschild homology group of the Novikov ring
associated to the 1-form and relate it to the torsion of a natural chain
homotopy equivalence between the Novikov complex and a simplicial complex of
the universal cover of M.
