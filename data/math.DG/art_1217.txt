Rigidité infinitésimale de cônes-variétés Einstein
  à courbure négative
Starting with a compact hyperbolic cone-manifold of dimension greater than or
equal to 3, we study the deformations of the metric with the aim of getting
Einstein cone-manifolds. If the singular locus is a closed codimension 2
submanifold and all cone angles are smaller than 2 pi, we show that there is no
non-trivial infinitesimal Einstein deformations preserving the cone angles.
