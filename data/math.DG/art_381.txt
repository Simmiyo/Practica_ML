On positivity of the Kadison constant and noncommutative Bloch theory
In an earlier paper, we established a natural connection between the
Baum-Connes conjecture and noncommutative Bloch theory, viz. the spectral
theory of projectively periodic elliptic operators on covering spaces. We
elaborate on this connection here and provide significant evidence for a
fundamental conjecture in noncommutative Bloch theory on the non-existence of
Cantor set type spectrum. This is accomplished by establishing an explicit
lower bound for the Kadison constant of twisted group C*-algebras in a large
number of cases, whenever the multiplier is rational.
