A Myers-type theorem and compact Ricci solitons
Let the Ricci curvature of a compact Riemannian manifold be greater, at every
point, than the Lie derivative of the metric with respect to some fixed smooth
vector field. It is shown that the fundamental group then has only finitely
many conjugacy classes. This applies, in particular, to all compact shrinking
Ricci solitons.
