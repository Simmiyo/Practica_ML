Einstein metrics on compact Lie groups which are not naturally reductive
The study of left-invariant Einstein metrics on compact Lie groups which are
naturally reductive was initiated by J. E. D'Atri and W. Ziller in 1979. In
1996 the second author obtained non-naturally reductive Einstein metrics on the
Lie group SU(n) for $n \ge 6$, by using a method of Riemannian submersions.
  In the present work we prove existence of non-naturally reductive Einstein
metrics on the compact simple Lie groups SO(n) ($n \geq 11$), $Sp(n)$ ($n \geq
3$),
  $E_6$, $E_7$, and $E_8$.
