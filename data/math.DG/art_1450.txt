The Bochner-flat cone of a CR manifold
We construct a Kahler structure (which we call a generalised Kahler cone) on
an open subset of the cone of a strongly pseudo-convex CR manifold endowed with
a 1-parameter family of compatible Sasaki structures. We determine those
generalised Kahler cones which are Bochner-flat and we study their local
geometry. We prove that any Bochner-flat Kahler manifold of complex dimension
bigger than two is locally isomorphic to a generalised Kahler cone.
