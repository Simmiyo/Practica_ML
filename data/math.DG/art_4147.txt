A Uniqueness Theorem for Gluing Calibrated Submanifolds
`Gluing' is a technique of constructing solutions to non-linear (elliptic)
partial differential equations such as Yang--Mills equations, minimal surface
equations and Einstein equations. Calibrated submanifolds are a certain class
of minimal surfaces, and there are various examples of them constructed by the
gluing technique. We have existence theorems in that sense, but there seems to
have been no uniqueness theory for higher-dimensional ones such as special
Lagrangian submanifolds, which we discuss in the present paper.
