Harnack inequality for the negative power Gaussian curvature flow
In this paper, we study the power of Gaussian curvature flow of a compact
convex hypersurface and establish its Harnack inequality when the power is
negative. In the Harnack inequality, we require that the absolute value of the
power is strictly positive and strictly less than the inverse of the dimension
of the hypersurface.
