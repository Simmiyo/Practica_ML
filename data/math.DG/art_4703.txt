Smooth Convergence Away from Singular Sets
We consider sequences of metrics, $g_j$, on a Riemannian manifold, $M$, which
converge smoothly on compact sets away from a singular set $S\subset M$, to a
metric, $g_\infty$, on $M\setminus S$. We prove theorems which describe when
$M_j=(M, g_j)$ converge in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense to the metric completion,
$(M_\infty,d_\infty)$, of $(M\setminus S, g_\infty)$. To obtain these theorems,
we study the intrinsic flat limits of the sequences. A new method, we call
hemispherical embedding, is applied to obtain explicit estimates on the
Gromov-Hausdorff and Intrinsic Flat distances between Riemannian manifolds with
diffeomorphic subdomains.
