On Willmore surfaces in S^n of flat normal bundle
We discuss several kinds of Willmore surfaces of flat normal bundle in this
paper. First we show that every S-Willmore surface with flat normal bundle in
$S^n$ must locate in some $S^3\subset S^n$, from which we characterize Clifford
torus as the only non-equatorial homogeneous minimal surface in $S^n$ with flat
normal bundle, which improve a result of K. Yang. Then we derived that every
Willmore two sphere with flat normal bundle in $S^n$ is conformal to a minimal
surface with embedded planer ends in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We also point out that for
a class of Willmore tori, they have flat normal bundle if and only if they
locate in some $S^3$. In the end, we show that a Willmore surface with flat
normal bundle must locate in some $S^6$
