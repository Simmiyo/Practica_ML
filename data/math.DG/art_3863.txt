Kähler Ricci flow with vanished Futaki invariant
We study the convergence of the K\"ahler-Ricci flow on a compact K\"ahler
manifold $(M,J)$ with positive first Chern class $c_1(M;J)$ and vanished Futaki
invariant on $\pi c_1(M;J)$. As the application we establish a criterion for
the stability of the K\"ahler-Ricci flow (with perturbed complex structure)
around a K\"ahler-Einstein metric with positive scalar curvature, under certain
local stable condition on the dimension of holomorphic vector fields. In
particular this gives a stability theorem for the existence of
K\"ahler-Einstein metrics on a K\"ahler manifold with possibly nontrivial
holomorphic vector fields.
