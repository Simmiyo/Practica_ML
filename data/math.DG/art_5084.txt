The module of unitarily invariant area measures
The hermitian analog of Aleksandrov's area measures of convex bodies is
investigated. A characterization of those area measures which arise as the
first variation of unitarily invariant valuations is established. General
smooth area measures are shown to form a module over smooth valuations and the
module of unitarily invariant area measures is described explicitly.
