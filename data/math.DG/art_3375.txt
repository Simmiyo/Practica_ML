Contact and 1-quasiconformal maps on Carnot groups
We characterize the rigidity of Carnot groups in the class of $C^2$ contact
maps in terms of complex characteristics. Furthermore, we obtain a Liouville
type theorem for Carnot groups which states that 1-quasiconformal maps form
finite dimensional Lie groups.
