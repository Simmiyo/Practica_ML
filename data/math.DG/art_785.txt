Eigenvalue estimates for the Dirac operator and harmonic 1-forms of
  constant length
We prove that on a compact $n$-dimensional spin manifold admitting a
non-trivial harmonic 1-form of constant length, every eigenvalue $\lambda$ of
the Dirac operator satisfies the inequality $\lambda^2 \geq
\frac{n-1}{4(n-2)}\inf_M Scal$. In the limiting case the universal cover of the
manifold is isometric to $R\times N$ where $N$ is a manifold admitting Killing
spinors.
