Geometry of the Weil-Petersson completion of Teichmüller space
We present a view of the current understanding of the geometry of
Weil-Petersson (WP) geodesics on the completion of the Teichm\"uller space. We
sketch a collection of results by other authors and then proceed to develop the
properties of the WP CAT(0) geometry. Our approach includes a simplified proof
of the Masur-Wolf theorem, a classification of flats and of geodesic limits.
