Classification of negatively pinched manifolds with amenable fundamental
  groups
We give a diffeomorphism classification of pinched negatively curved
manifolds with amenable fundamental groups, namely, they are precisely the
M\"obius band, and the products of a line with the total spaces of flat vector
bundles over closed infranilmanifolds.
