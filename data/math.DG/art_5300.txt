Straight ruled surfaces in the Heisenberg group
We generalise a result of Garofalo and Pauls: a horizontally minimal smooth
surface embedded in the Heisenberg group is locally a (straight) ruled surface,
i.e. it consists of straight lines tangent to a horizontal vector field along a
smooth curve. We show additionally that any horizontally minimal surface is
locally contactomorphic to the complex plane.
