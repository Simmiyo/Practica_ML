Asymptotic Nets and Discrete Affine Surfaces with Indefinite Metric
Asymptotic net is an important concept in discrete differential geometry. In
this paper, we show that we can associate affine discrete geometric concepts to
an arbitrary non-degenerate asymptotic net. These concepts include discrete
affine area, mean curvature, normal and co-normal vector fields and cubic form,
and they are related by structural and compatibility equations. We consider
also the particular cases of affine minimal surfaces and affine spheres.
