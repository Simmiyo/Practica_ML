Relative torsion
This paper achieves, among other things, the following: 1)It frees the main
result of [BFKM] from the hypothesis of determinant class and extends this
result from unitary to arbitrary representations. 2)It extends (and at the same
times provides a new proof of) the main result of Bismut and Zhang [BZ] from
finite dimensional representations of $\Gamma$ to representations on an ${\cal
A}-$Hilbert module of finite type (${\cal A}$ a finite von Neumann algebra).
The result of [BZ] corresponds to ${\cal A}=\bbc.$ 3)It provides interesting
real valued functions on the space of representations of the fundamental group
$\Gamma$ of a closed manifold M. These functions might be a useful source of
topological and geometric invariants of M. These objectives are achieved with
the help of the relative torsion $\cal R $, first introduced by Carey, Mathai
and Mishchenko [CMM] in special cases. The main result of this paper calculates
explicitly this relative torsion (cf Theorem 0.1).
