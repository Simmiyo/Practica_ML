Deformations of G_2 and Spin(7) Structures on Manifolds
We consider some infinitesmal and global deformations of G_2 structures on
7-manifolds. We discover a canonical way to deform a G_2 structure by a vector
field in which the associated metric gets "twisted" in some way by the vector
cross product. We present a system of partial differential equations for an
unknown vector field whose solution would yield a manifold with holonomy G_2.
Similarly we consider analogous constructions for Spin(7) structures on
8-manifolds. Some of the results carry over directly, while others do not
because of the increased non-linearity of the Spin(7) case.
