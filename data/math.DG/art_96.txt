Singular points of lightlike hypersurfaces of the de Sitter space
The authors study singular points of lightlike hypersurfaces of the de Sitter
space S^{n+1}_1 and the geometry of hypersurfaces and use them for construction
of an invariant normalization and an invariant affine connection of lightlike
hypersurfaces.
