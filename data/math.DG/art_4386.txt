Conformally Invariant Powers of Spin Operators on the Sphere
We give explicit formulas for all odd order differential intertwinors on the
subbundle of the bundle of spinor-$k$-forms that are annihilated by the
Clifford multiplication over the odd dimensional standard sphere. The Dirac and
Rarita-Schwinger operators appear in the case of $k=0$ and $k=1$, respectively.
