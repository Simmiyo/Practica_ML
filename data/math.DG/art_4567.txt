Four-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian homogeneous Ricci solitons
We consider four-dimensional homogeneous pseudo-Riemannian manifolds with
non-trivial isotropy and completely classify the cases giving rise to
non-trivial homogeneous Ricci solitons. In particular, we show the existence of
non-compact homogeneous (and also invariant) pseudo-Riemannian Ricci solitons
which are not isometric to solvmanifolds, and of conformally flat homogeneous
pseudo-Riemannian Ricci solitons which are not symmetric.
