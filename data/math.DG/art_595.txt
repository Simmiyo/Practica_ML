Algebraic curvature tensors for indefinite metrics whose skew-symmetric
  curvature operator has constant Jordan normal form
We classify the connected pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of signature $(p,q)$
with $q\ge5$ so that at each point of $M$ the skew-symmetric curvature operator
has constant rank 2 and constant Jordan normal form on the set of spacelike 2
planes and so that the skew-symmetric curvature operator is not nilpotent for
at least one point of $M$.
