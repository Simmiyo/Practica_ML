A note on stochastic calculus in vector bundles
The aim of these notes is to relate covariant stochastic integration in a
vector bundle $E$ (as in Norris \cite{Norris}) with the usual Stratonovich
calculus via the connector $\K:TE \rightarrow E$ (cf. e.g. Paterson
\cite{Paterson} or Poor \cite{Poor}) which carries the connection dependence.
