Regular infinite dimensional Lie groups
Regular Lie groups are infinite dimensional Lie groups with the property that
smooth curves in the Lie algebra integrate to smooth curves in the group in a
smooth way (an `evolution operator' exists). Up to now all known smooth Lie
groups are regular. We show in this paper that regular Lie groups allow to push
surprisingly far the geometry of principal bundles: parallel transport exists
and flat connections integrate to horizontal foliations as in finite
dimensions. As consequences we obtain that Lie algebra homomorphisms intergrate
to Lie group homomorphisms, if the source group is simply connected and the
image group is regular.
