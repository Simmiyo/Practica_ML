On an extention of the H^k mean curvature flow of closed convex
  hypersurfaces
In this paper we prove that the H^k (k is odd and larger than 2) mean
curvature flow of a closed convex hypersurface can be extended over the maximal
time provided that the total L^p integral of the mean curvature is finite for
some p
