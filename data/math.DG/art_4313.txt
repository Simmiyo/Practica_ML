A note on CR quaternionic maps
We introduce the notion of CR quaternionic map and we prove that any such
real-analytic map, between CR quaternionic manifolds, is the restriction of a
quaternionic map between quaternionic manifolds. As an application, we prove,
for example, that for any submanifold $M$, of dimension $4k-1$, of a
quaternionic manifold $N$, such that $TM$ generates a quaternionic subbundle of
$TN|_M$, of (real) rank $4k$, there exists, locally, a quaternionic submanifold
of $N$, containing $M$ as a hypersurface.
