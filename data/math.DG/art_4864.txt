$\mathcal{F}$-stability for self-shrinking solutions to mean curvature
  flow
In this paper, we formulate the notion of the $\mathcal{F}$-stability of
self-shrinking solutions to mean curvature flow in arbitrary codimension. Then
we give some classifications of the $\mathcal{F}$-stable self-shrinkers in
arbitrary codimension, in codimension one case, our results reduce to
Colding-Minicozzi's results.
