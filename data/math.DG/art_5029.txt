General construction of symmetric parabolic structures
First we introduce a generalization of symmetric spaces to parabolic
geometries. We provide construction of such parabolic geometries starting with
classical symmetric spaces and we show that all regular parabolic geometries
with smooth systems of involutive symmetries can be obtained this way. Further,
we investigate the case of parabolic contact geometries in great detail and we
provide the full classification of those with semisimple groups of symmetries
without complex factors. Finally, we explicitly construct all non-trivial
contact geometries with non-complex simple groups of symmetries. We also
indicate geometric interpretations of some of them.
