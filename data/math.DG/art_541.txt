Moduli space of symmetric connections
The action of origin-preserving diffeomorphisms on a space of jets of
symmetric connections is considered. Dimensions of moduli spaces of generic
connections are calculated. Poincar\'e series of the geometric structure of
symmetric connection is constructed, and shown to be a rational function.
