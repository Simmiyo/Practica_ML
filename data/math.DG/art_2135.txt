Jacobi operators along the structure flow on real hypersurfaces in a
  nonflat complex space form
Let $M$ be a real hypersurface of a complex space form with almost contact
metric structure $(\phi, \xi, \eta, g)$. In this paper, we study real
hypersurfaces in a complex space form whose structure Jacobi operator
$R_\xi=R(\cdot,\xi)\xi$ is $\xi$-parallel. In particular, we prove that the
condition $\nabla_{\xi} R_{\xi}=0$ characterizes the homogeneous real
hypersurfaces of type $A$ in a complex projective space or a complex hyperbolic
space when $R_{\xi} \phi S=S \phi R_{\xi}$ holds on $M$, where $S$ denotes the
Ricci tensor of type (1,1) on $M$.
