Riemannian groupoids and solitons for three-dimensional homogeneous
  Ricci and cross curvature flows
In this paper we investigate the behavior of three-dimensional homogeneous
solutions of the cross curvature flow using Riemannian groupoids. The
Riemannian groupoid technique, introduced by John Lott, allows us to
investigate the long term behavior of collapsing solutions of the flow,
producing soliton solutions in the limit. We also review Lott's results on the
long term behavior of three-dimensional homogeneous solutions of Ricci flow,
demonstrating the coordinates we choose and reviewing the groupoid technique.
We find cross curvature soliton metrics on Sol and Nil, and show that the cross
curvature flow of SL(2,R) limits to Sol.
