On conformally invariant differential operators
We construct new families of conformally invariant differential operators
acting on densities. We introduce a simple, direct approach which shows that
all such operators arise via this construction when the degree is bounded by
the dimension. The method relies on a study of well-known transformation laws
and on Weyl's theory regarding identities holding ``formally'' vs. ``by
substitution''. We also illustrate how this new method can strengthen existing
results in the parabolic invariant theory for conformal geometries.
