Asymptotic Dirichlet problems for Laplace's and minimal equations on
  Hadamard manifolds
It is proved the existence of entire solutions of the Laplace's and minimal
hypersurface's PDEs on a Hadamard manifold $M$ under certain curvature
conditions by investigating the asymptotic Dirichlet's problems for these PDEs.
In the harmonic case it is obtained an existence result which assumes the same
growth condition on the sectional curvature as of Theorem 1.2 of E. Hsu
\cite{Hsu} but that contemplates cases having Ricci curvature with exponential
decay. It is also obtained a result which extends and improves Theorem 3.6 of
Choi \cite{Choi}. In the minimal case one obtains an extension and an
improvement of Theorem 1 of N. do Esp\'{\i}rito-Santo, S. Fornari and J. Ripoll
\cite{EFR}, and partial extensions of Theorem 5.2 of J. A. G\'alvez and H.
Rosenberg \cite{GR} by allowing the sectional curvature of $M$ degenerate to 0
at infinity.
