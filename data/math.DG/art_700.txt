Volume minimization for Lagrangian submanifolds in complex manifolds
  with negative first Chern class
It is classically known that closed geodesics on a compact Riemann surface
with a metric of negative curvature strictly minimize length in their free
homotopy class. We'd like to generalize this to Lagrangian submanifolds in
K\"ahler manifolds of negative Ricci curvature. The only known result in this
direction is a theorem on Y.I. Lee for certain Lagrangian submanifolds in a
product of two Riemann surfaces of constant negative curvature. We develop an
approach to study this problem in higher dimensions. Along the way we prove
some weak results (volume-minimization outside of a divisor) and give a
counterexample to global volume-minimization for an immersed minimal Lagrangian
submanifold.
