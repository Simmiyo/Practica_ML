On the classification of the real vector subspaces of a quaternionic
  vector space
We prove the classification of the real vector subspaces of a quaternionic
vector space by using a covariant functor which, to any pair formed of a
quaternionic vector space and a real subspace, associates a coherent sheaf over
the sphere.
