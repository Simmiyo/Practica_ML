Symplectic mean curvature flows in Kähler surfaces with positive
  holomorphic sectional curvatures
In this paper, we mainly study the mean curvature flow in K\"ahler surfaces
with positive holomorphic sectional curvatures. We prove that if the ratio of
the maximum and the minimum of the holomorphic sectional curvatures is less
than 2, then there exists a positive constant $\delta$ depending on the ratio
such that $\cos\alpha\geq\delta$ is preserved along the flow.
