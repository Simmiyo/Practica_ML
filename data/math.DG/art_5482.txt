Classification and Analysis of Mean Curvature Flow Self-Shrinkers
We investigate Mean Curvature Flow self-shrinking hypersurfaces with
polynomial growth. It is known that such self shrinkers are unstable. We focus
mostly on self-shrinkers of the form $\mathbb S^k\times\R^{n-k}\subset
\R^{n+1}$. We use a connection between the stability operator and the quantum
harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian to find all eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of
the stability operator on these self-shrinkers. We also show self-shrinkers of
this form have lower index than all other complete self-shrinking
hypersurfaces. In particular, they have finite index. This implies that the
ends of such self shrinkers must be stable. We look for the largest stable
regions of these self shrinkers.
