Kropina metrics and Zermelo navigation on Riemannian manifolds
The present paper studies globally defined Kropina metrics as solutions of
the Zermelo's navigation problem. Moreover, we characterize the Kropina metrics
of constant flag curvature showing that up to local isometry, there are only
two model spaces of them: the Euclidean space and the odd-dimensional spheres.
