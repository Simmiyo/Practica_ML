Curvature invariants, Killing vector fields, connections and
  cohomogeneity
A direct, bundle-theoretic method for defining and extending local isometries
out of curvature data is developed. As a by-product, conceptual direct proofs
of a classical result of Singer and a recent result of the authors are derived.
