Differential invariants of generic parabolic Monge-Ampere equations
Some new results on geometry of classical parabolic Monge-Amp\`ere equations
(PMA) are presented. PMAs are either \emph{integrable}, or \emph{nonintegrable}
according to integrability of its characteristic distribution. All integrable
PMAs are locally equivalent to the equation $u_{xx}=0$. We study nonintegrable
PMAs by associating with each of them a 1-dimensional distribution on the
corresponding first order jet manifold, called the \emph{directing
distribution}. According to some property of this distribution, nonintegrable
PMAs are subdivided into three classes, one \emph{generic} and two
\emph{special} ones. Generic PMAs are completely characterized by their
directing distributions, and we study canonical models of the latters,
\emph{projective curve bundles} (PCB). A PCB is a 1-dimensional subbundle of
the projectivized cotangent bundle of a 4-dimensional manifold. Differential
invariants of projective curves composing such a bundle are used to construct a
series of contact differential invariants for corresponding PMAs. These give a
solution of the equivalence problem for generic PMAs with respect to contact
transformations. The introduced invariants measure in an exact manner
nonlinearity of PMAs.
