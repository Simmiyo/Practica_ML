Isometric rigidity in codimension two
We show that among the Euclidean submanifolds with codimension two the ones
of rank two that are parabolic but nonruled are isometrically rigid. This
generalizes the result in [10] that these submanifolds are genuinely rigid. In
addition, we give a parametric classifications of all parabolic submanifolds.
