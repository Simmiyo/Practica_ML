Osserman and conformally Osserman manifolds with warped and twisted
  product structure
We characterize Osserman and conformally Osserman Riemannian manifolds with
the local structure of a warped product. By means of this approach we analyze
the twisted product structure and obtain, as a consequence, that the only
Osserman manifolds which can be written as a twisted product are those of
constant curvature.
