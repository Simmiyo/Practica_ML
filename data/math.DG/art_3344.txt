Weyl homogeneous manifolds modeled on compact Lie groups
A Riemannian manifold is called Weyl homogeneous, if its Weyl tensors at any
two points are "the same", up to a positive multiple. A Weyl homogeneous
manifold is modeled on a homogeneous space $M_0$, if its Weyl tensor at every
point is "the same" as the Weyl tensor of $M_0$, up to a positive multiple. We
prove that a Weyl homogeneous manifold $M^n, n \ge 4$, modeled on an
irreducible symmetric space $M_0$ of types II or IV (compact simple Lie group
with a bi-invariant metric or its noncompact dual) is conformally equivalent to
$M_0$.
