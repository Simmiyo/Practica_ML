On the number of minimal surfaces with a given boundary
We generalize the following result of White: Suppose $N$ is a compact,
strictly convex domain in $\RR^3$ with smooth boundary. Let $\Sigma$ be a
compact 2-manifold with boundary. Then a generic smooth curve $\Gamma\cong
\partial\Sigma$ in $\partial N$ bounds an odd or even number of embedded
minimal surfaces diffeomorphic to $\Sigma$ according to whether $\Sigma$ is or
is not a union of disks. First, we prove that the parity theorem holds for any
compact riemannian 3-manifold $N$ such that $N$ is strictly mean convex, $N$ is
homeomorphic to a ball, $\partial N$ is smooth, and $N$ contains no closed
minimal surfaces. We then further relax the hypotheses by allowing $N$ to be
weakly mean convex and to have piecewise smooth boundary. We extend the parity
theorem yet further by showing that, under an additional hypothesis, it remains
true for minimal surfaces with prescribed symmetries.
  The parity theorems are used in an essential way to prove the existence of
embedded genus-$g$ helicoids in $\SS^2\times \RR$. We give a very brief outline
of this application. (The full argument will appear elsewhere.)
