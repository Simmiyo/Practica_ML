Evolutionary forms: The generation of differential-geometrical
  structures. (Symmetries and Conservation laws.)
Evolutionary forms, as well as exterior forms, are skew-symmetric
differential forms. But in contrast to the exterior forms, the basis of
evolutionary forms is deforming manifolds (with unclosed metric forms). Such
forms possess a peculiarity, namely, the closed inexact exterior forms are
obtained from that.
  The closure conditions of inexact exterior form (vanishing the differentials
of exterior and dual forms) point out to the fact that the closed inexact
exterior form is a quantity conserved on pseudostructure having the dual form
as the metric form. We obtain that the closed inexact exterior form and
corresponding dual form made up a conservative object, i.e. a quantity
conserved on pseudostructure. Such conservative object corresponds to the
conservation law and is a differential-geometrical structure.
  Transition from the evolutionary form to the closed inexact exterior form
describes the process of generating the differential-geometrical structures.
This transition is possible only as a degenerate transformation, the condition
of which is a realization of a certain symmetry.
  Physical structures that made up physical fields are such
differential-geometrical structures. And they are generated by material systems
(medias). Relevant symmetries are caused by the degrees of freedom of material
system.
