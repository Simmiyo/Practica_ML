An obstructions to Non-negative curvature on Bundles with Pull-back
  connections
Motivated to study the geometry of the exotic spheres constructed in [5], we
derive a necessary condition for non-negative sectional curvature in certain
total spaces of Riemannian submersions with totally geodesic fibers. In
particular, we prove that the bundles in [5] and [1] have sections of negative
curvature.
