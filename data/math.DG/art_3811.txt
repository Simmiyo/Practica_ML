Surfaces in $\E^3$ making constant angle with Killing vector fields
In the present paper we classify curves and surfaces in Euclidean $3-$space
which make constant angle with a certain Killing vector field. Moreover, we
characterize the catenoid and Dini's surface in terms of constant angle
surfaces.
