Special Lagrangians of cohomogeneity one in the resolved conifold
In this paper, which is a natural continuation of our previous paper
math.DG/0504557, we describe some special Lagrangians of cohomogeneity one in
the resolved conifold. Our main result gives a foliation of the resolved
conifold by T^2-invariant special Lagrangians, where the generic leaf is
topologically T^2 X R. We also obtain a family of SO(3)-invariant special
Lagrangians. These special Lagrangian families in both the deformed and the
resolved conifold approach asymptotically the same special Lagrangian cones in
the conifold.
