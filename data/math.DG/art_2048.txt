Spinorial Characterization of Surfaces into 3-dimensional homogeneous
  Manifolds
We give a spinorial characterization of isometrically immersed surfaces into
3-dimensional homogeneous manifolds with 4-dimensional isometry group in terms
of the existence of a particular spinor, called generalized Killing spinor.
This generalizes results by T. Friedrich for $\R^3$ and B. Morel for $\Ss^3$
and $\HH^3$. The main argument is the interpretation of the energy-momentum
tensor of a genralized Killing spinor as the second fondamental form up to a
tensor depending on the structure of the ambient space
