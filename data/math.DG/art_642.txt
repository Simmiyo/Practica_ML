"A priori" estimates for solutions of singular elliptic inequalities and
  applications
We obtain a maximum principle, and "a priori" upper estimates for solutions
of a class of non linear singular elliptic differential inequalities on
Riemannian manifolds under the sole geometrical assumption of volume growth
conditions. Various applications of the results obtained are presented.
