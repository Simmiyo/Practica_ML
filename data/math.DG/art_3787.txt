Equigeodesics on full, $G_2$ and a rank-three condition on flag
  manifolds
This paper provides a characterization and examples of homogeneous geodesics
on full $G/T$ and $G_{2}$ flag manifolds. We discuss for generalized root
systems the property of sum-zero triple of $T$-roots and give several
applications of this result.
