Poisson structures on the Teichmueller space of hyperbolic surfaces with
  conical points
In this paper two Poisson structures on the moduli space of hyperbolic
surfaces with conical points are compared: the Weil-Petersson one and the \eta
coming from the representation variety. We show that they are multiple of each
other, if the angles do not exceed 2\pi. Moreover, we exhibit an explicit
formula for \eta in terms of hyperbolic lengths of a suitable system of arcs.
