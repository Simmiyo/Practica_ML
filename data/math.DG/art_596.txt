Algebraic curvature tensors whose skew-symmetric curvature operator has
  constant rank 2
Let R be an algebraic curvature tensor for a non-degenerate inner product of
signature(p,q) where q>4. If $\pi$ is a spacelike 2 plane, let $R(\pi)$ be the
associated skew-symmetric curvature operator. We classify the algebraic
curvature tensors so R(-) has constant rank 2 and show these are geometrically
realizable by hypersurfaces in flat spaces. We also classify the Ivanov-Petrova
algebraic curvature tensors of rank 2; these are the algebraic curvature
tensors of constant rank 2 such that the complex Jordan normal form of R(-) is
constant.
