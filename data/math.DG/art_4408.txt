On the motion of a curve by its binormal curvature
We propose a weak formulation for the binormal curvature flow of curves in
$\R^3.$ This formulation is sufficiently broad to consider integral currents as
initial data, and sufficiently strong for the weak-strong uniqueness property
to hold, as long as self-intersections do not occur. We also prove a global
existence theorem in that framework.
