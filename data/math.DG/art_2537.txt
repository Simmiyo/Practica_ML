An end-to-end-construction for singly periodic minimal surfaces
We show the existence of various families of properly embedded singly
periodic minimal surfaces in R^3 with finite arbitrary genus and Scherk type
ends in the quotient. The proof of our results is based on the gluing of small
perturbations of pieces of already known minimal surfaces.
