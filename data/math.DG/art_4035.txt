On differential completions and compactifications of a differential
  space
Differential completions and compactifications of differential spaces are
introduced and investigated. The existence of the maximal differential
completion and the maximal differential compactification is proved. A
sufficient condition for the existence of a complete uniform differential
structure on a given differential space is given.
