A Classification and Examples of Four-Dimensional Nonisoclinic
  Three-Webs
A classification and examples of four-dimensional isoclinic three-webs of
codimension two are given. The examples considered prove the existence theorem
for many classes of webs for which the general existence theorems are not
proved yet.
