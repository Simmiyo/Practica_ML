The rigidity theorems of self shrinkers
By using certain idea developed in minimal submanifold theory we study
rigidity problem for self-shrinkers in the present paper. We prove rigidity
results for squared norm of the second fundamental form of self-shrinkers,
either under point-wise conditions or under integral conditions.
