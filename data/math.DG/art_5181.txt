Universal curvature identities III
We examine universal curvature identities for pseudo-Riemannian manifolds
with boundary. We determine the Euler-Lagrange equations associated to the
Chern-Gauss-Bonnet formula and show that they are given solely in terms of
curvature {and the second fundamental form and do not involve covariant
derivatives thus generalizing a conjecture of Berger to this context.
