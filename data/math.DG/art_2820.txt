On the Index of Constant Mean Curvature Hypersurfaces
In 1968, Simons introduced the concept of index for hypersurfaces immersed
into the Euclidean sphere S^{n+1}. Intuitively, the index measures the number
of independent directions in which a given hypersurface fails to minimize area.
The earliest results regarding the index focused on the case of minimal
hypersurfaces. Many such results established lower bounds for the index. More
recently, however, mathematicians have generalized these results to
hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature. In this paper, we consider
hypersurfaces of constant mean curvature immersed into the sphere and give
lower bounds for the index under new assumptions about the immersed manifold.
