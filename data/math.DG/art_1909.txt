Involutions of compact Riemannian 4-symmetric spaces
Let G/H be a compact 4-symmetric space of inner type such that the dimension
of the center Z(H) of H is at most one. In this paper we shall classify
involutions of G preserving H for the case where dim Z(H)=0, or H is a
centralizer of a toral subgroup of G.
