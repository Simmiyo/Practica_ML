Lamarle Formula in 3-Dimensional Lorentz Space
The Lamarle Formula, given by Kruppa in \cite{Kr}, is known as a relationship
between the Gaussian curvature and the distribution parameter of a ruled
surface in the surface theory. The ruled surfaces were investigated in 3
different classes with respect to the character of base curves and rulings,
\cite{Tu1},\cite{Tu2}. In this paper on account of these studies, the
relationships between the Gaussian curvatures and distribution parameters of
spacelike ruled surface, timelike ruled surface with spacelike ruling and
timelike ruled surface with timelike ruling are obtained, respectively. These
relationships are called as Lorentzian Lamarle formulas. Finally some examples
concerning with these relations are given.
