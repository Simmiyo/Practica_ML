Isometries between leaf spaces
In this paper we prove that an isometry between orbit spaces of two proper
isometric actions is smooth if it preserves the codimension of the orbits or if
the orbit spaces have no boundary. In other words, we generalize
Myers-Steenrod's theorem for orbit spaces. These results are proved in the more
general context of singular Riemannian foliations.
