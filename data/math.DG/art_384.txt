A h-principle for open relations invariant under foliated isotopies
This paper presents a natural extension to foliated spaces of the following
result due to Gromov : the h-principle for open, invariant differential
relations is valid on open manifolds. The definition of openness for foliated
spaces adopted here involves a certain type of Morse functions. Consequences
concerning the problem of existence of regular Poisson structures, the original
motivation for this work, are presented.
