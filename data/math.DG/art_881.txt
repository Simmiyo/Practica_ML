Hypersymplectic four-dimensional Lie algebras
A study is made of real Lie algebras admitting a hypersymplectic structure,
and we provide a method to construct such hypersymplectic Lie algebras. We use
this method in order to obtain the classification of all hypersymplectic
structures on four-dimensional Lie algebras, and we describe the associated
metrics on the corresponding Lie groups.
