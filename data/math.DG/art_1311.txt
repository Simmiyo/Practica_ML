Collapsing manifolds obtained by Kummer-type constructions
We construct F-structures on a Bott manifold and on some other manifolds
obtained by Kummer-type constructions. We also prove that if M=E#X, where E is
a fiber bundle with structure group G and a fiber admitting a G-invariant
metric of non-negative sectional curvature and X admits an F-structure with one
trivial covering, then one can construct on M a sequence of metrics with
sectional curvature uniformly bounded from below and volume tending to zero
(i.e. $Vol_K$ (M)=0). As a corollary we prove that all the elements in the Spin
cobordism group can be represented by manifolds M with $Vol_K$ (M)==0.
