A dynamical interpretation of the profile curve of cmc Twizzlers
  surfaces
It is known that for any non-zero $M in (-1/4,infty)$, if we roll the conic
{(x,y): 4 x^2-y^2/M}=1} on a line in a plane, and then we rotate about this
line the trace of a focus, then we obtain a surface of revolution D(M) with
mean curvature 1. If M<=0, D(M) is embedded and it is called unduloid, if M>0,
D(M) is not embedded and it is called nodoid. These surfaces are called
Delaunays and they are foliated by circles. The trace of the focus in the
construction above is called the profile curve of the Delaunay and it is
transversal to the circles. Another well known family of constant mean
curvature surfaces are the Twizzlers, they are foliated by helices and we can
naturally define a profile curve which is transversal to the helices. To make
the presentation in this abstract easier, we will be only considering Twizzlers
with mean curvature 1. In this paper we will prove that if we roll the profile
curve of a Twizzler on a line in a plane and, simultaneously, we move the
points in the line at the same speed, so that the rolling motion of the profile
curve looks like if it were placed on a treadmill, then, the trace made by the
origin of the profile curve is one of the closed heart-shaped curves
HS(M,w)={(x,y) : x^2+y^2+y/(1+w^2 x^2)=M} for some M>-1/4 and w>0. Using this
dynamical interpretation we will prove several properties for Twizzlers
