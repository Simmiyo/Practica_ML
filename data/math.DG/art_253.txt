Local rigidity of certain classes of almost Kahler 4-manifolds
We show that any non-Kahler, almost Kahler 4-manifold for which both the
Ricci and the Weyl curvatures have the same algebraic symmetries as they have
for a Kahler metric is locally isometric to the (only) proper 3-symmetric
4-dimensional space described by O. Kowalski.
