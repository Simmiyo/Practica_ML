Mean Curvature Flow, Orbits, Moment Maps
Given a compact Riemannian manifold together with a group of isometries, we
discuss MCF of the orbits and some applications: eg, finding minimal orbits. We
then specialize to Lagrangian orbits in Kaehler manifolds. In particular, in
the Kaehler-Einstein case we find a relation between MCF and moment maps which,
for example, proves that the minimal Lagrangian orbits are isolated.
