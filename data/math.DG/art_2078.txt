Lectures on Poisson groupoids
In these lecture notes, we give a quick account of the theory of Poisson
groupoids and Lie bialgebroids. In particular, we discuss the universal lifting
theorem and its applications including integration of quasi-Lie bialgebroids,
integration of Poisson Nijenhuis structures and Alekseev and
Kosmann-Schwarzbach's theory of D/G-momentum maps.
