Quasi-Kaehler manifolds with a pair of Norden metrics
The basic class of the non-integrable almost complex manifolds with a pair of
Norden metrics are considered. The interconnections between corresponding
quantities at the transformation between the two Levi-Civita connections are
given. A 4-parametric family of 4-dimensional quasi-Kaehler manifolds with
Norden metric is characterized with respect to the associated Levi-Civita
connection.
