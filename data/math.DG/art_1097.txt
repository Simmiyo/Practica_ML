Multi-valued graphs in embedded constant mean curvature disks
In this paper we prove that an embedded and simply connected constant mean
curvature surface with curvature large at a point contains a multi-valued graph
around that point on the scale of $|A|^2$, where $|A|^2$ is the norm squared of
the second fundamental form. This generalizes Colding and Minicozzi's result
for minimal surfaces.
