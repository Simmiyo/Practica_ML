Spacelike CMC 1 surfaces with elliptic ends in de Sitter 3-Space
We show that an Osserman-type inequality holds for spacelike surfaces of
constant mean curvature (CMC) 1 with singularities and with elliptic ends in de
Sitter 3-space. An immersed end of a CMC 1 surface is an ``elliptic end'' if
the monodromy representation at the end is diagonalizable with eigenvalues in
the unit circle. We also give a necessary and sufficient condition for equality
in the inequality to hold, and in the process of doing this we derive a
condition for determining when elliptic ends are embedded.
