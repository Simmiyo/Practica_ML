Isometric Immersions of the Hyperbolic Plane into the Hyperbolic Space
In this paper, we parametrize the space of isometric immersions of the
hyperbolic plane into the hyperbolic 3-space in terms of null-causal curves in
the space of oriented geodesics. Moreover, we characterize "ideal cones" (i.e.,
cones whose vertices are on the ideal boundary) by behavior of their mean
curvature.
