Modular Classes of Loday Algebroids
We introduce the concept of Loday algebroids, a generalization of Courant
algebroids. We define the naive cohomology and modular class of a Loday
algebroid, and we show that the modular class of the double of a Lie
bialgebroid vanishes. For Courant algebroids, we describe the relation between
the naive and standard cohomologies and we conjecture that they are isomorphic
when the Courant algebroid is transitive.
