Boundedness of certain automorphism groups of an open manifold
It is shown that certain diffeomorphism or homeomorphism groups with no
restriction on support of an open manifold with finite number of ends are
bounded. It follows that these groups are uniformly perfect. In order to
characterize the boundedness several conditions on automorphism groups of an
open manifold are introduced. In particular, it is shown that the commutator
length diameter of the automorphism group $\mathcal D(M)$ of a portable
manifold $M$ is estimated by $2fragd_{\mathcal D(M)}+2$, where $fragd_{\mathcal
D(M)}$ is the diameter of $\mathcal D(M)$ in the fragmentation norm.
