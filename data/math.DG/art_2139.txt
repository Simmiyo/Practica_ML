Eigenvalues Estimates For The Dirac Operator In Terms Of Codazzi Tensors
We prove a lower bound for the first eigenvalue of the Dirac operator on a
compact Riemannian spin manifold depending on the scalar curvature as well as a
chosen Codazzi tensor. The inequality generalizes the classical estimate from
[2].
