Special Riemannian geometries and the Magic Square of Lie algebras
We investigate nonintegrable Riemannian geometries modelled after certain
symmetric spaces related to the Freudenthal-Tits Magic Square. The collection
of four such structures found by Nurowski is extended by further eight. A focus
is given to those admitting a compatible connection with completely skew
torsion.
