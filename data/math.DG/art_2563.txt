On Blocking Numbers of Surfaces
The blocking number of a manifold is the minimal number of points needed to
block out lights between any two given points in the manifold. It has been
conjectured that if the blocking number of a manifold is finite, then the
manifold must be flat. In this paper we prove that this is true for
2-dimensional manifolds with non-trivial fundamental groups.
