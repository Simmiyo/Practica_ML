Towards a classification of Lorentzian holonomy groups. Part II:
  Semisimple, non-simple weak-Berger algebras
The holonomy group of an (n+2)-dimensional simply-connected, indecomposable
but non-irreducible Lorentzian manifold (M,h) is contained in the parabolic
group $(\mathbb{R} \times SO(n))\ltimes \mathbb{R}^n$. The main ingredient of
such a holonomy group is the SO(n)--projection $G:=pr_{SO(n)}(Hol_p(M,h))$ and
one may ask whether it has to be a Riemannian holonomy group. In this paper we
show that this is always the case, completing our results of the first part
math.DG/0305139. We draw consequences for the existence of parallel spinors on
Lorentzian manifolds.
