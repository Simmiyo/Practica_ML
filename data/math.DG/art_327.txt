Flat Lorentz 3-Manifolds and Cocompact Fuchsian Groups
This paper gives a new proof of a result of Geoff Mess that the linear
holonomy group of a complete flat Lorentz 3-manifold cannot be cocompact in
SO(2,1). The proof uses a signed marked Lorentzian length-spectrum invariant
developed by G.Margulis, reinterpreted in terms of deformations of hyperbolic
surfaces.
