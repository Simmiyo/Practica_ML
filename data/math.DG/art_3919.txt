The Hijazi inequalities on complete Riemannian Spin$^c$ manifolds
In this paper, we extend the Hijazi type inequality, involving the
Energy-Momentum tensor, to the eigenvalues of the Dirac operator on complete
Riemannian Spin$^c$ manifolds without boundary and of finite volume. Under some
additional assumptions, using the refined Kato inequality, we prove the Hijazi
type inequality for elements of the essential spectrum. The limiting cases are
also studied.
