Curvature of (special) almost Hermitian manifolds
We study the curvature of almost Hermitian manifolds and their special
analogues via intrinsic torsion and representation theory. By deriving
different forumlae for the skew-symmetric part of the star-Ricci curvature, we
find that some of these contributions are dependent on the approach used, and
for the almost Hermitian case we obtain tables that differ from those of
Falcitelli, Farinola and Salamon. We show how the exterior algebra may used to
explain some of these variations.
