Inclusions between parabolic geometries
Some of the well known Fefferman like constructions of parabolic geometries
end up with a new structure on the same manifold. In this paper, we classify
all such cases with the help of the classical Onishchik's lists \cite{onish1}
and we treat in detail the only new series of inclusions providing the
spinorial structures on the manifolds with generic free distributions. Our
technique relies on the cohomological understanding of the canonical normal
Cartan connections for parabolic geometries and the classical computations with
exterior forms. Apart of the complete discussion of the distributions from the
geometrical point of view and the new functorial construction of the inclusion
into the spinorial geometry, we also discuss the normality problem of the
resulting spinorial connections. In particular, there is a non--trivial
subclass of distributions providing normal spinorial connections directly by
the construction.
