Hermitian integral geometry
We give in explicit form the principal kinematic formula for the action of
the affine unitary group on $\C^n$, together with a straightforward algebraic
method for computing the full array of unitary kinematic formulas, expressed in
terms of certain convex valuations introduced, essentially, by H. Tasaki. We
introduce also several other canonical bases for the algebra of
unitary-invariant valuations, explore their interrelations, and characterize in
these terms the cones of positive and monotone elements.
