Special Lagrangian manifolds obtained from complex Grassmannians
This paper gives an example of special Lagrangian manifold obtained from a
hypersurface of a complex Grassmannian with vanishing first Chern class. The
obtained manifold is a 1-torus bundle over the two dimensional real projective
space. Such manifolds are interesting for mirror symmetry theory. Other
examples of the same type are provided at the end of this article.
