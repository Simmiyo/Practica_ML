How to Construct a Dirac Operator in Infinite Dimensions
We define the notion of a co-Riemannian structure and show how it can be used
to define the Dirac operator on an appropriate infinite dimensional manifold.
In particular, this approach works for the smooth loop space of a so-called
string manifold.
