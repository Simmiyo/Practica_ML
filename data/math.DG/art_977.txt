Reducibility of Dupin submanifolds
We introduce the notion of weak reduciblity for Dupin submanifolds with
arbitrary codimension. We give a complete characterization of all weakly
reducible Dupin submanifolds, as a consequence of a general result on a broader
class of Euclidean submanifolds. As a main application, we derive an explicit
recursive procedure to generate all holonomic Dupin submanifolds in terms of
solutions of completely integrable systems of linear partial differential
equations of first order. We obtain several additional results on Dupin
submanifolds.
