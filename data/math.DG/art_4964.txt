Quasi-umbilical affine hypersurfaces congruent to their centre map
In this paper, we study strictly convex affine hypersurfaces centroaffinely
congruent to their centre map, in the case when the shape operator has two
distinct eigenvalues: one of multiplicity 1, and one nonzero of multiplicity
n-1. We show how to construct them from (n-1)-dimensional affine hyperspheres.
