Dehn Filling and Asymptotically Hyperbolic Einstein Manifolds
In this article, we extend Anderson's higher-dimensional Dehn filling
construction to a large class of infinite-volume hyperbolic manifolds. This
gives an infinite family of topologically distinct asymptotically hyperbolic
Einstein manifolds with the same conformal infinity. The construction involves
finding a sequence of approximate solutions to the Einstein equations and then
perturbing them to exact ones.
