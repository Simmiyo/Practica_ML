Gradient Kahler Ricci Solitons
Some observations about the local and global generality of gradient Kahler
Ricci solitons are made, including the existence of a canonically associated
holomorphic volume form and vector field, the local generality of solutions
with a prescribed holomorphic volume form and vector field, and the existence
of Poincare coordinates in the case that the Ricci curvature is positive and
the vector field has a fixed point.
