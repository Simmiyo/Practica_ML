The classification of locally conformally flat Yamabe solitons
We provide the classification of locally conformally flat gradient Yamabe
solitons with positive sectional curvature. We first show that locally
conformally flat gradient Yamabe solitons with positive sectional curvature
have to be rotationally symmetric and then give the classification and
asymptotic behavior of all radially symmetric gradient Yamabe solitons. We also
show that any eternal solutions to the Yamabe flow with positive Ricci
curvature and with the scalar curvature attaining an interior space-time
maximum must be a steady Yamabe soliton.
