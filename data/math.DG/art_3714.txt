Hopf fibration: geodesics and distances
Here we study geodesics connecting two given points on odd-dimensional
spheres respecting the Hopf fibration. This geodesic boundary value problem is
completely solved in the case of 3-dimensional sphere and some partial results
are obtained in the general case. The Carnot-Carath\'eodory distance is
calculated. We also present some motivations related to quantum mechanics.
