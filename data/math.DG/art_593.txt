Curvature tensors whose Jacobi or Szabo operator is nilpotent on null
  vectors
We show that any $k$ Osserman Lorentzian algebraic curvature tensor has
constant sectional curvature and give an elementary proof that any local 2
point homogeneous Lorentzian manifold has constant sectional curvature. We also
show that a Szab\'o Lorentzian covariant derivative algebraic curvature tensor
vanishes.
