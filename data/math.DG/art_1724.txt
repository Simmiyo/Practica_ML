On the Conformal Geometry of Transverse Riemann-Lorentz Manifolds
Physical reasons suggested in \cite{Ha-Ha} for the \emph{Quantum Gravity
Problem} lead us to study \emph{type-changing metrics} on a manifold. The most
interesting cases are \emph{Transverse Riemann-Lorentz Manifolds}. Here we
study the conformal geometry of such manifolds.
