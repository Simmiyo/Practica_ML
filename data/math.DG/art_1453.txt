Special symplectic six-manifolds
We classify nilmanifolds with an invariant symplectic half-flat structure. We
solve the half-flat evolution equations in one example, writing down the
resulting Ricci-flat metric. We study the geometry of the orbit space of
6-manifolds with an SU(3)-structure preserved by a U(1) action, giving
characterizations in the symplectic half-flat and integrable case.
