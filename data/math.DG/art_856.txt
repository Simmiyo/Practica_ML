A survey on Nahm transform
We review the construction known as the Nahm transform in a generalized
context, which includes all the examples of this construction already described
in the literature. The Nahm transform for translation invariant instantons on
$\real^4$ is presented in an uniform manner. We also analyze two new examples,
the first of which being the first example involving a four-manifold that is
not complex.
