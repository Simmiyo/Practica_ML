Index theorems on manifolds with straight ends
We study Fredholm properties and index formulas for Dirac operators over
complete Riemannian manifolds with straight ends. An important class of
examples of such manifolds are complete Riemannian manifolds with pinched
negative sectional curvature and finite volume.
