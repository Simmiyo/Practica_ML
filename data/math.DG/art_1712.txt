Injectivity radius and Cartan polyhedron for simply connected symmetric
  spaces
We explore relationship between the cut locus of an arbitrary simply
connected and compact Riemannian symmetric space and the Cartan polyhedron of
corresponding restricted root system, and compute injectivity radius and
diameter for every type of irreducible ones.
