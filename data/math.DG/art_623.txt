An upper bound for a Hilbert polynomial on quaternionic Kahler manifolds
In this article we prove an upper bound for a Hilbert polynomial on
quaternionic Kaehler manifolds of positive scalar curvature. As corollaries we
obtain bounds on the quaternionic volume and the degree of the associated
twistor space. Moreover the article contains some details on differential
equations of finite type. Part of it is used in the proof of the main theorem.
