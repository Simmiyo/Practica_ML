Isometric immersions in codimension two of warped products into space
  forms
We provide a local classification of isometric immersions $f\colon
L^p\times_\rho M^n\to\Q_c^{p+n+k}$ in codimensions $k=1, 2$ of warped products
of Riemannian manifolds into space forms, under the assumptions that $n\geq
k+1$ and that $N^{p+n}=L^p\times_\rho M^n$ has no points with the same constant
sectional curvature $c$ as the ambient space form.
