A note on Perelman's LYH inequality
We give a proof to the Li-Yau-Hamilton type inequality claimed by Perelman on
the fundamental solution to the conjugate heat equation. The rest of the paper
is devoted to improving the known differential inequalities of Li-Yau-Hamilton
type via monotonicity formulae.
