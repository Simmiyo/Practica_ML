Metric flips with Calabi ansatz
We study the limiting behavior of the Kahler-Ricci flow on
$\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n} \oplus
\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(-1)^{\oplus (m+1)})$, assuming the initial metric
satisfies the Calabi symmetry. We show that the flow either shrinks to a point,
collapses to $\mathbb{P}^n$ or contracts a subvariety of codimension m+1 in
Gromov-Hausdorff sense. We also show that the Kahler-Ricci flow resolves
certain type of conical singularities in Gromov-Hausdorff sense.
