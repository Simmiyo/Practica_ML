Optimal eigenvalues estimate for the Dirac operator on domains with
  boundary
We give a lower bound for the eigenvalues of the Dirac operator on a compact
domain of a Riemannian spin manifold under the $\MIT$ bag boundary condition.
The limiting case is characterized by the existence of an imaginary Killing
spinor.
