Quantization of q-Hamiltonian SU(2)-spaces
We explain how to define the quantization of q-Hamiltonian SU(2)-spaces as
push-forwards in twisted K-homology, and prove a `quantization commutes with
reduction' theorem for this setting. As applications, we show how the Verlinde
formulas for flat SU(2) or SO(3) bundles are obtained by localization in
twisted K-homology.
