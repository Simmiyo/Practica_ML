Complex Product Structures on Lie Algebras
A study is made of real Lie algebras admitting compatible complex and product
structures, including numerous 4-dimensional examples. If g is a Lie algebra
with such a structure then its complexification has a hypercomplex structure.
It is shown in addition that g splits into the sum of two left-symmetric
subalgebras. Interpretations of these results are obtained that are relevant to
the theory of both hypercomplex and hypersymplectic manifolds and their
associated connections.
