Schottky uniformization and vector bundles over Riemann surfaces
We study a natural map from representations of a free group of rank g in
GL(n,C), to holomorphic vector bundles of degree 0 over a compact Riemann
surface X of genus g, associated with a Schottky uniformization of X. Maximally
unstable flat bundles are shown to arise in this way. We give a necessary and
sufficient condition for this map to be a submersion, when restricted to
representations producing stable bundles. Using a generalized version of
Riemann's bilinear relations, this condition is shown to be true on the
subspace of unitary Schottky representations.
