Invariant strong KT geometry on four-dimensional solvable Lie groups
A strong KT (SKT) manifold consists of a Hermitian structure whose torsion
three-form is closed. We classify the invariant SKT structures on
four-dimensional solvable Lie groups. The classification includes solutions on
groups that do not admit compact four-dimensional quotients. It also shows that
there are solvable groups in dimension four that admit invariant complex
structures but have no invariant SKT structure.
