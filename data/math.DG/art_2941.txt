On the existence of min-max minimal torus
In this paper, we will study the existence problem of minmax minimal torus.
We use classical conformal invariant geometric variational methods. We prove a
theorem about the existence of minmax minimal torus in Theorem 5.1. Firstly we
prove a strong uniformization result(Proposition 3.1) using method of [1]. Then
we use this proposition to choose good parametrization for our minmax
sequences. We prove a compactification result(Lemma 4.1) similar to that of
Colding and Minicozzi [2], and then give bubbling convergence results similar
to that of Ding, Li and Liu [7]. In fact, we get an approximating result
similar to the classical deformation lemma(Theorem 1.1).
