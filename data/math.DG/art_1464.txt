Hölder Compactification for some manifolds with pinched negative
  curvature near infinity
We consider a complete noncompact Riemannian manifold M and give conditions
on a compact submanifold K of M so that the outward normal exponential map off
of the boundary of K is a diffeomorphism onto M\K. We use this to compactify M
and show that pinched negative sectional curvature outside K implies M has a
compactification with a well defined H\"older structure independent of K. The
H\"older constant depends on the ratio of the curvature pinching. This extends
and generalizes a 1985 result of Anderson and Schoen.
