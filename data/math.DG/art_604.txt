Hyperbolic constant mean curvature one surfaces: Spinor representation
  and trinoids in hypergeometric functions
We present a global representation for surfaces in 3-dimensional hyperbolic
space with constant mean curvature 1 (CMC-1 surfaces) in terms of holomorphic
spinors. This is a modification of Bryant's representation.
  It is used to derive explicit formulas in hypergeometric functions for CMC-1
surfaces of genus 0 with three regular ends which are asymptotic to catenoid
cousins (CMC-1 trinoids).
