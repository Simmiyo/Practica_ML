Geometric resolution of singular Riemannian foliations
We prove that an isometric action of a Lie group on a Riemannian manifold
admits a resolution preserving the transverse geometry if and only if the
action is infinitesimally polar. We provide applications concerning topological
simplicity of several classes of isometric actions, including polar and
variationally complete ones. All results are proven in the more general case of
singular Riemannian foliations.
