Möbius-flat hypersurfaces in projective space
I give a theory of Moebius-flat hypersurfaces in n-dimensional projective
space, analogous to that in conformal geometry. This unifies the classes of
hypersurfaces with flat induced conformal structure (n > 3) and a classically
studied class of surfaces (n = 3). I extend an example of Akivis-Konnov, and
use polynomial conserved quantities to characterise hypersurfaces with flat
centro-affine metric among Moebius-flat hypersurfaces. The theory has an
obvious counterpart in Lie sphere geometry.
