Constructions with bundle gerbes
This thesis develops the theory of bundle gerbes and examines a number of
useful constructions in this theory. These allow us to gain a greater insight
into the structure of bundle gerbes and related objects. Furthermore they
naturally lead to some interesting applications in physics.
