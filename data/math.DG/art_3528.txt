Convex Neighbourhoods and Complete Finsler Spaces
In this paper, it is shown that a large set of connections on a suitable
sub-bundle of the tangent bundle of a Finsler Manifold can be used to study all
the properties of convex neighbourhoods with respect to the Finsler Metric,
which are needed to see that any Complete Finsler Space is Geodesically
Connected.
