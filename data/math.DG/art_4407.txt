Static flow on complete noncompact manifolds I: short-time existence and
  asymptotic expansions at conformal infinity
In this paper, we study short-time existence of static flow on complete
noncompact asymptotically static manifolds from the point of view that the
stationary points of the evolution equations can be interpreted as static
solutions of the Einstein vacuum equations with negative cosmological constant.
For a static vacuum $(M^n,g,V),$ we also compute the asymptotic expansions of
$g$ and $V$ at conformal infinity.
