On infinitesimal deformations of cmc surfaces of finite type in the
  3-sphere
We describe infinitesimal deformations of constant mean curvature surfaces of
finite type in the 3-sphere. We use Baker-Akhiezer functions to describe such
deformations, as well as polynomial Killing fields and the corresponding
spectral curve to distinguish between isospectral and non-isospectral
deformations.
