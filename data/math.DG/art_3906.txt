The group of diffeomorphisms of a non compact manifold is not regular
We show that a group of diffeomorphisms $\D$ on the open unit interval $I,$
equipped with the topology of uniform convergence on any compact set of the
derivatives at any order, is non regular: the exponential map is not defined
for some path of the Lie algebra. this result extends to the group of
diffeomorphisms of finite dimensional, non compact manifold $M.$
