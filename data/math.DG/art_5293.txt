Integrable Complex Structures on Twistor Spaces
We introduce integrable complex structures on twistor spaces fibered over
complex manifolds. We then show, in particular, that the twistor spaces
associated with generalized Kahler, SKT and strong HKT manifolds all naturally
admit complex structures. Moreover, in the strong HKT case we construct a
metric and three compatible complex structures on the twistor space that have
equal torsions.
