Extremality for the Vafa-Witten bound on the sphere
We prove that the round metric on the sphere has the largest first eigenvalue
of the Dirac operator among all metrics that are larger than it. As a
corollary, this gives an alternative proof of an extremality result for scalar
curvature due to M. Llarull.
