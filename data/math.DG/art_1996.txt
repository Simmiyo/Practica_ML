Symmetries in Differential Geometry: A Computational Approach to
  Prolongations
The aim of this work is to develop a systematic manner to close
overdetermined systems arising from conformal Killing tensors (CKT). The
research performs this action for 1-tensor and 2-tensors. This research makes
it possible to develop a new general method for any rank of CKT. This method
can also be applied to other types of Killing equations, as well as to
overdetermined systems constrained by some other conditions.
  The major methodological apparatus of the research is a decomposition of the
section bundles where the covariant derivatives of the CKT land via generalized
gradients. This decomposition generates a tree in which each row represents a
higher derivative. After using the conformal Killing equation, just a few
components (branches) survive, which means that most of them can be expressed
in terms of lower order terms. This results in a finite number of independent
jets. Thus, any higher covariant derivative can be written in terms of these
jets.
  The findings of this work are significant methodologically and, more
specifically, in the potential for the discovery of symmetries. First, this
work has uncovered a new method that could be used to close overdetermined
systems arising from conformal Killing tensors (CKT). Second, through an
application of this method, this research finds higher symmetry operators of
first and second degree, which are known by other means, for the Laplace
operator. The findings also reveal the first order symmetry operators for the
Yamabe case. Moreover, the research leads to conjectures about the second order
symmetries of the Yamabe operator.
