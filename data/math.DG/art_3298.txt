A d'Alembert Formula for Hopf Hypersurfaces
A Hopf hypersurface in complex hyperbolic space CH^n is one in which the
complex structure applied to the normal vector is a principal direction at each
point. In this paper, Hopf hypersurfaces for which the corresponding principal
curvature is small (relative to the ambient sectional curvature) are studied by
means of a generalized Gauss map into a product of spheres, and it is shown
that the hypersurface may be recovered from the image of this map, via an
explicit formula.
