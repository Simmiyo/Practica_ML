Generalized holomorphic bundles and the B-field action
On a generalized complex manifold there is an associated definition of a
generalized holomorphic bundle, introduced by Gualtieri. This notion in the
case of an ordinary complex structure yields an object which we call a co-Higgs
bundle and we consider the B-field action of a closed form of type (1,1), both
local and global. The effect makes contact with both Nahm's equations and
holomorphic gerbes.
