Structure D'Un Drapeau Riemannien
The aim of this paper is to show that any stable complete Riemannian flag on
a compact and connected manifold is conjugated to a flag of homogenus
foliations (see Definitions). Also, we give a characterization of Riemannian
flags that homogenus. This result is a step toward the classification of
Riemannian flags.
