The Mean Curvature of the Second Fundamental Form of a hypersurface
An expression for the first variation of the area functional of the second
fundamental form is given for a hypersurface in a semi-Riemannian space. The
concept of the "mean curvature of the second fundamental form" is then
introduced. Some characterisations of extrinsic hyperspheres in terms of this
curvature are given.
