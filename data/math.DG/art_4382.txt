The harmonicity of nearly cosymplectic structures
Almost contact structures can be identified with sections of a twistor bundle
and this allows to define their harmonicity, as sections or maps. We consider
the class of nearly cosymplectic almost contact structures on a Riemannian
manifold and prove curvature identities which imply the harmonicity of their
parametrizing section, thus complementing earlier results on nearly-K{\"a}hler
almost complex structures.
