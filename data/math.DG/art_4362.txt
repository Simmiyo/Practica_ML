On a class of complete non-compact gradient Yamabe solitons
We derive lower bounds on the scalar curvature of complete non-compact
gradient Yamabe solitons under some integral curvature conditions. Based on
this, we prove that the corresponding potential functions have at most
quadratic growth in distance. We also obtain a finite topological type property
on complete shrinking gradient Yamabe solitons under suitable scalar curvature
assumptions.
