Surfaces with parallel mean curvature vector in complex space forms
We consider a quadratic form defined on the surfaces with parallel mean
curvature vector of an any dimensional complex space form and prove that its
$(2,0)$-part is holomorphic. When the complex dimension of the ambient space is
equal to $2$ we define a second quadratic form with the same property and then
determine those surfaces with parallel mean curvature vector on which the
$(2,0)$-parts of both of them vanish. We also provide a reduction of
codimension theorem and prove a non-existence result for $2$-spheres with
parallel mean curvature vector.
