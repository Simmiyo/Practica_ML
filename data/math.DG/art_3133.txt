Properties of biharmonic submanifolds in spheres
In the present paper we survey the most recent classification results for
proper biharmonic submanifolds in unit Euclidean spheres. We also obtain some
new results concerning geometric properties of proper biharmonic constant mean
curvature submanifolds in spheres.
