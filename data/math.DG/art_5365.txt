Classification of invariant AHS--structures on semisimple locally
  symmetric spaces
In this article, we discuss which semisimple locally symmetric spaces admit
an AHS--structure invariant to local symmetries. We classify them for all types
of AHS--structures and determine possible equivalence classes of such
AHS--structures.
