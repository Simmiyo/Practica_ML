Integrable Isotropic Geometrical Flows and Heisenberg Ferromagnets
Geometrical flows (GF) play an important role in modern mathematics and
physics. In this letter we have considered some integrable isotropic GF --
Ricci flows (RF) and mean curvature flows (MCF) -- which are related with
integrable Heisenberg ferromagnets. In 2+1 dimensions, these GF have a
singularity at $t=t_{0}$.
