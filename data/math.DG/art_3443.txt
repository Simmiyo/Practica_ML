Indefinite extrinsic symmetric spaces II
Having developed a description of indefinite extrinsic symmetric spaces by
corresponding infinitesimal objects in the preceding paper we now study the
classification problem for these algebraic objects. In most cases the
transvection group of an indefinite extrinsic symmetric space is not
semisimple, which makes the classification difficult. We use the recently
developed method of quadratic extensions for (h,K)-invariant metric Lie
algebras to tackle this problem. We obtain a one-to-one correspondence between
isometry classes of extrinsic symmetric spaces and a certain cohomology set.
This allows a systematic construction of extrinsic symmetric spaces and
explicit classification results, e.g., if the metric of the embedded manifold
or the ambient space has a small index. We will illustrate this by classifying
all Lorentzian extrinsic symmetric spaces.
