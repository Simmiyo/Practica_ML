Geodesic connectedness of multiwarped spacetimes
A new technique for the study of geodesic connectedness in a class of
Lorentzian manifolds is introduced. It is based on arguments of Brouwer's
topological degree for the solution of functional equations. It is shown to be
very useful for multiwarped spacetimes, which include different types of
relativistic spacetimes.
