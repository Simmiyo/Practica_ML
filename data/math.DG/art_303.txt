Some Special Geometry in Dimension Six
We generalise the notion of contact manifold by allowing the contact
distribution to have codimension two. There are special features in dimension
six. In particular, we show that the complex structure on a three-dimensional
complex contact manifold is determined solely by the underlying contact
distribution.
