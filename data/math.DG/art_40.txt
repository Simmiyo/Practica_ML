Functions on space curves
We classify simple singularities of functions on space curves. We show that
their bifurcation sets have properties very similar to those of functions on
smooth manifolds and complete intersections [1,2]: the k(pi, 1)-theorem for the
bifurcations diagram of functions is true, and both this diagram and the
discriminant are Saito's free divisors.
