Singularities of improper affine spheres and surfaces of constant
  Gaussian curvature
We study the equation for improper (parabolic) affine spheres from the view
point of contact geometry and provide the generic classification of
singularities appearing in geometric solutions to the equation as well as their
duals. We also show the results for surfaces of constant Gaussian curvatureand
for developable surfaces. In particular we confirm that generic singularities
appearing in such a surface are just cuspidal edges and swallowtails.
