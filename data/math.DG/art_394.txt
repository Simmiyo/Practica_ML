Einstein Metrics Adapted to Contact Structures on 3-Manifolds
The Newman-Penrose-Perjes formalism is applied to smooth contact structures
on riemannian 3-manifolds. In particular it is shown that a contact 3-manifold
admits an adapted riemannian metric if and only if it admits a metric with a
divergence-free, constantly twisting, geodesic congruence. The shear of this
congruence is identified with the torsion of the associated pseudohermitian
structure, while the Tanaka-Webster curvature is identified with certain
derivatives of the spin coefficients. The particular case where the associated
riemannian metric is Einstein is studied in detail. It is found that the
torsion is constant and the field equations are completely solved locally.
Hyperbolic space forms are shown not to have adapted contact structures, even
locally, while contact structures adapted to a flat or elliptic space form are
contact isometric to the standard one.
