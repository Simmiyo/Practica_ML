Differential geometry of grassmannians and Plucker map
Using the Plucker map between grassmannians, we study basic aspects of
classic grassmannian geometries. For `hyperbolic' grassmannian geometries, we
prove some facts (for instance, that the Plucker map is a minimal isometric
embedding) that were previously known in the `elliptic' case.
