The pluriclosed flow on nilmanifolds and Tamed symplectic forms
We study evolution of (strong K\"ahler with torsion) SKT structures via the
pluriclosed flow on complex nilmanifolds, i.e. on compact quotients of simply
connected nilpotent Lie groups by discrete subgroups endowed with an invariant
complex structure. Adapting to our case the techniques introduced by Jorge
Lauret for studying Ricci flow on homogeneous spaces we show that for SKT Lie
algebras the pluriclosed flow is equivalent to a bracket flow and we prove a
long time existence result in the nilpotent case. Finally, we introduce a
natural flow for evolving tamed symplectic forms on a complex manifold, by
considering evolution of symplectic forms via the flow induced by the Bismut
Ricci form.
