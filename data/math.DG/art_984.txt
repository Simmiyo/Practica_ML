Connection of the differential-geometrical structures with
  skew-symmetric differential forms. Forming differential-geometrical
  structures and manifolds
The closure conditions of the inexact exterior differential form and dual
form (an equality to zero of differentials of these forms) can be treated as a
definition of some differential-geometrical structure. Such a connection
discloses the properties and specific features of the differential-geometrical
structures.
  The using of skew-symmetric differential forms enables one to reveal a
mechanism of forming differential-geometrical structures as well. To do this,
it is necessary to consider the skew-symmetric differential forms whose basis,
unlike to the case of exterior differential forms, are manifolds with unclosed
metric forms. Such differential forms possess the evolutionary properties. They
can generate closed differential forms, which correspond to the
differential-geometrical structures.
