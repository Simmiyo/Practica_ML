Powers of the space forms curvature operator and geodesics of the
  tangent bundle
It is well-known that if a curve is a geodesic line of the tangent (sphere)
bundle with Sasaki metric of a locally symmetric Riemannian manifold then the
projected curve has all its geodesic curvatures constant. In this paper we
consider the case of tangent (sphere) bundle over the real, complex and
quaternionic space form and give a unified proof of the following property: all
geodesic curvatures of projected curve are zero starting from k_3,k_6 and
k_{10} for the real, complex and quaternionic space formes respectively.
