The entropy formula for linear heat equation
We derive the entropy formula for the linear heat equaiton on complete
Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature. As applications, we
study the relation between the value of entropy and the volume of balls of
various scales. The results are simpler version, without Ricci flow, of
Perelman's recent results on volume non-collapsing.
