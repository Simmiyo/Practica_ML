Embedded surfaces and almost complex structures
We prove necessary and sufficient conditions for a smooth surface in a
4-manifold X to be pseudoholomorphic with respect to some almost complex
structure on X. This provides a systematic approach to the construction of
pseudoholomorphic curves that do not minimize the genus in their homology
class.
