Some Characterizations of Special Curves in the Euclidean Space
  $\mathrm{E}^4$
In this work, first, we express some characterizations of helices and ccr
curves in the Euclidean 4-space. Thereafter, relations among Frenet-Serret
invariants of Bertrand curve of a helix are presented. Moreover, in the same
space, some new characterizations of involute of a helix are presented.
