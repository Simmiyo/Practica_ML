Topological characterization of various types of rings of smooth
  functions
Topologies on algebraic and equational theories are used to define germ
determined, near-point determined, and point determined rings of smooth
functions, without requiring them to be finitely generated. It is proved, that
any commutative algebra morphism (without requiring continuity) between
near-point determined rings of smooth functions is smooth (and hence
continuous).
