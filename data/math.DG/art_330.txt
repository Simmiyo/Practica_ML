Twistor quotients of hyperkaehler manifolds
We generalize the hyperkaehler quotient construction to the situation where
there is no group action preserving the hyperkaehler structure but for each
complex structure there is an action of a complex group preserving the
corresponding complex symplectic structure. Many (known and new) hyperkaehler
manifolds arise as quotients in this setting. For example, all hyperkaehler
structures on semisimple coadjoint orbits of a complex semisimple Lie group $G$
arise as such quotients of $T^*G$. The generalized Legendre transform
construction of Lindstroem and Rocek is also explained in this framework.
