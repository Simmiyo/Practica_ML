Zero sets of eigenspinors for generic metrics
Let $M$ be a closed connected spin manifold of dimension $2$ or $3$ with a
fixed orientation and a fixed spin structure. We prove that for a generic
Riemannian metric on $M$ the non-harmonic eigenspinors of the Dirac operator
are nowhere zero. The proof is based on a transversality theorem and the unique
continuation property of the Dirac operator.
