The projective space has maximal volume among all toric
  Kähler-Einstein manifolds
We prove a conjecture saying that complex projective space has maximal volume
(degree) among all toric Kaehler-Einstein manifolds of dimension n. The proof
is inspired by our recent work on sharp Moser-Trudinger and Brezis-Merle type
inequalities for the complex Monge-Ampere operator, but is essentially
self-contained.
