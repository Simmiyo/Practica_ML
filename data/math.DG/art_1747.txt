Conformally Einstein Products and Nearly Kähler Manifolds
In the first part of this note we study compact Riemannian manifolds (M,g)
whose Riemannian product with R is conformally Einstein. We then consider
compact 6--dimensional almost Hermitian manifolds of type W_1+W_4 in the
Gray--Hervella classification admitting a parallel vector field and show that
(under some regularity assumption) they are obtained as mapping tori of
isometries of compact Sasaki-Einstein 5-dimensional manifolds. In particular,
we obtain examples of inhomogeneous locally (non-globally) conformal nearly
K\"ahler compact manifolds.
