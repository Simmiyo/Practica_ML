Special biconformal changes of Kähler surface metrics
The term "special biconformal change" refers, basically, to the situation
where a given nontrivial real-holomorphic vector field on a complex manifold is
a gradient relative to two K\"ahler metrics, and, simultaneously, an
eigenvector of one of the metrics treated, with the aid of the other, as an
endomorphism of the tangent bundle. A special biconformal change is called
nontrivial if the two metrics are not each other's constant multiples. For
instance, according to a 1995 result of LeBrun, a nontrivial special
biconformal change exists for the conformally-Einstein K\"ahler metric on the
two-point blow-up of the complex projective plane, recently discovered by Chen,
LeBrun and Weber; the real-holomorphic vector field involved is the gradient of
its scalar curvature. The present paper establishes the existence of nontrivial
special biconformal changes for some canonical metrics on Del Pezzo surfaces,
viz. K\"ahler-Einstein metrics (when a nontrivial holomorphic vector field
exists), non-Einstein K\"ahler-Ricci solitons, and K\"ahler metrics admitting
nonconstant Killing potentials with geodesic gradients.
