A class of locally symmetric Kaehler Einstein structures on the
  cotangent bundle of a space form
We obtain a class of locally symmetric Kaehler Einstein structures on the
cotangent bundle of a Riemannian manifold of negative sectional curvature.
Similar results are obtained in the case of a Riemannian manifold of positive
sectional curvature. The obtained class of Kaehler Einstein structures depends
on one essential parameter and cannot have constant holomorphic sectional
curvature.
