Grassmann Geometries and Integrable Systems
We describe how the loop group maps corresponding to special submanifolds
associated to integrable systems may be thought of as certain Grassmann
submanifolds of infinite dimensional homogeneous spaces. In general, the
associated families of special submanifolds are certain Grassmann submanifolds.
An example is given from recent work of the author.
