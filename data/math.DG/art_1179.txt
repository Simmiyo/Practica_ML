Metric and Gauge Extensors
In this paper, the second in a series of eight we continue our development of
the basic tools of the multivector and extensor calculus which are used in our
formulation of the differential geometry of smooth manifolds of arbitrary
topology . We introduce metric and gauge extensors, pseudo-orthogonal metric
extensors, gauge bases, tetrad bases and prove the remarkable golden formula,
which permit us to view any Clifford algebra Cl(V,G) as a deformation of the
euclidean Clifford algebra Cl(V,G_{E}) discussed in the first paper of the
series and to easily perform calculations in Cl(V,G) using Cl(V,G_{E}).
