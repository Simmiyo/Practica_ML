A primer on the (2+1) Einstein universe
The Einstein universe is the conformal compactification of Minkowski space.
It also arises as the ideal boundary of anti-de Sitter space. The purpose of
this article is to develop the synthetic geometry of the Einstein universe in
terms of its homogeneous submanifolds and causal structure, with particular
emphasis on dimension $2 + 1$, in which there is a rich interplay with
symplectic geometry.
