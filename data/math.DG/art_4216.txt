Moving Frames and Conservation Laws for Euclidean Invariant Lagrangians
Noether's First Theorem yields conservation laws for Lagrangians with a
variational symmetry group. The explicit formulae for the laws are well known
and the symmetry group is known to act on the linear space generated by the
conservation laws. In recent work the authors showed the mathematical structure
behind both the Euler-Lagrange system and the set of conservation laws, in
terms of the differential invariants of the group action and a moving frame. In
this paper we demonstrate that the knowledge of this structure considerably
eases finding the extremal curves for variational problems invariant under the
special Euclidean groups SE(2) and SE(3).
