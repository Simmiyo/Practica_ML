The decomposition of Global Conformal Invariants I: On a conjecture of
  Deser and Schwimmer
This is the first in a series of papers where we prove a conjecture of Deser
and Schwimmer regarding the algebraic structure of ``global confor- mal
invariants"; these are defined to be conformally invariant integrals of
geometric scalars. The conjecture asserts that the integrand of any such
integral can be expressed as a linear combination of a local conformal
invariant, a divergence and of the Chern-Gauss-Bonnet integrand.
  In this paper we set up an iterative procedure that proves the decom-
position. We then derive the iterative step in the first of two cases, subject
to a purely algebraic result which is proven in [6, 7, 8].
