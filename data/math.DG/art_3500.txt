Constant mean curvature hypersurfaces with single valued projections on
  planar domains
A classical problem in constant mean curvature hypersurface theory is, for
given $H\geq 0$, to determine whether a compact submanifold $\Gamma^{n-1}$ of
codimension two in Euclidean space $\R_+^{n+1}$, having a single valued
orthogonal projection on $\R^n$, is the boundary of a graph with constant mean
curvature $H$ over a domain in $\R^n$. A well known result of Serrin gives a
sufficient condition, namely, $\Gamma$ is contained in a right cylinder $C$
orthogonal to $\R^n$ with inner mean curvature $H_C\geq H$. In this paper, we
prove existence and uniqueness if the orthogonal projection $L^{n-1}$ of
$\Gamma$ on $\R^n$ has mean curvature $H_L\geq-H$ and $\Gamma$ is contained in
a cone $K$ with basis in $\R^n$ enclosing a domain in $\R^n$ containing $L$
such that the mean curvature of $K$ satisfies $H_K\geq H$. Our condition
reduces to Serrin's when the vertex of the cone is infinite.
