Equivariant de Rham Theory and Graphs
Goresky, Kottwitz and MacPherson have recently shown that the computation of
the equivariant cohomology ring of a G-manifold can be reduced to a computation
in graph theory. This opens up the possibility that many of the fundamental
theorems in equivariant de Rham theory may, on closer inspection, turn out
simply to be theorems about graphs. In this paper we show that for some
familiar theorems, this is indeed the case.
