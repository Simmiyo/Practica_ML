Maximal rank maps between Riemannian manifolds with bounded geometry
If Pi: M -> B is an onto smooth maximal rank map between complete Riemannian
manifolds M and B with bounded geometry, we prove sufficient conditions for M
to be roughly isometric to the Riemannian product FxB, where F is a fiber of M.
