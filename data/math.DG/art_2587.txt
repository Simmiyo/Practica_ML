Comparison results for conjugate and focal points in semi-Riemannian
  geometry via Maslov index
We prove an estimate on the difference of Maslov indices relative to the
choice of two distinct reference Lagrangians of a continuous path in the
Lagrangian Grassmannian of a symplectic space. We discuss some applications to
the study of conjugate and focal points along a geodesic in a semi-Riemannian
manifold.
