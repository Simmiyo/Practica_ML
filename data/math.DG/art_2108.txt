Several Dirac Operator in parabolic geometry
In this thesis, we show the existence of a sequence of differential operators
starting with with the Dirac operator in k Clifford variables, $D=(D_1,...,
D_k)$, where $D_i=\sum_j e_j\cdot \partial_{ij}: C^\infty((\R^n)^k,\S)\to
C^\infty((\R^n)^k,\S)$ ($\S$ is the spinor module). This operator is the
Cauchy-Riemann operator for n=2 and its resolution is the Dolbeault complex.
For higher n, the resolution of D is not known in general. While this problem
was treated many times in the language of Clifford analysis and some partial
results are known, we give a description of this operator in Parabolic
geometry, which is a special type of Cartan geometry modeled on $G/P$, where P
is a Parabolic subgroup of G. We construct sequences of invariant differential
operators starting with the Dirac operator in several variables and assume that
these sequences coinside in some cases with the resolution. We describe the
structure of these sequences precisely in case the dimension $n$ is odd and
give a conjecture that these sequences have similar structure for n even,
$k\leq n/2$ (the s.c. {\it stable range}). We also give some information about
these sequences in case n even, k>n/2. In the last chapter, explicite formulas
for the operators are derived for the case k=2.
