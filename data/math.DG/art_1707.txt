Orthogonal almost-complex structures of minimal energy
In this article we apply a Bochner type formula to show that on a compact
conformally flat riemannian manifold (or half-conformally flat in dimension 4)
certain types of orthogonal almost-complex structures, if they exist, give the
absolute minimum for the energy functional. We give a few examples when such
minimizers exist, and in particular, we prove that the standard almost-complex
structure on the round S^6 gives the absolute minimum for the energy. We also
discuss the uniqueness of this minimum and the extension of these results to
other orthogonal G-structures.
