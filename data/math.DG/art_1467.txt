Counting hyperbolic manifolds with bounded diameter
Let $\rho_n(V)$ be the number of complete hyperbolic manifolds of dimension n
with volume less than $V$. Burger, Gelander, Lubotzky, and Moses showed that
when n>3 there exist a,b>0 depending on the dimension such that aV log(V) <
log(\rho_n(V)) < bV log(V), for V >> 0. In this note, we use their methods to
bound the number of hyperbolic manifolds with diameter less than d and show
that the number grows double-exponentially. Additionally, this bound holds in
dimension 3.
