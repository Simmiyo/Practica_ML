Isometries of complemented subRiemannian manifolds
We show that the group of smooth isometries of a complemented sub-Riemannian
manifold form a Lie group and establish dimension estimates based on the
torsion of the canonical connection. We explore the interaction of curvature
and the structure of isometries and Killing fields and derive a Bochner formula
for Killing fields. Sub-Riemannian generalizations of classical results of
Bochner and Berger are established. We also apply our theory to common
sub-categories of complemented sub-Riemannian geometries and show how to
compute the isometry groups for several examples, including SO(n), SL(n) and
the rototranslation group.
