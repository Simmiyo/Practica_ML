Differential Geometry of Microlinear Frolicher Spaces III
As the third of our series of papers on differential geometry of microlinear
Frolicher spaces, this paper is devoted to the Frolicher-Nijenhuis calculus of
their named bracket. The main result is that the Frolicher-Nijenhuis bracket
satisfies the graded Jacobi identity. It is also shown that the Lie derivation
preserves the Frolicher-Nijenhuis bracket. Our definitions and discussions are
highly geometric, while Frolicher and Nijenhuis' original definitions and
discussions were highly algebraic.
