Harmonic spinors and local deformations of the metric
Let (M,g) be a compact Riemannian spin manifold. The Atiyah-Singer index
theorem yields a lower bound for the dimension of the kernel of the Dirac
operator. We prove that this bound can be attained by changing the Riemannian
metric g on an arbitrarily small open set.
