Geometry of Distributions and $F-$Gordon equation
In this paper we describe the geometry of distributions by their symmetries,
and present a simplified proof of the Frobenius theorem and some related
corollaries. Then, we study the geometry of solutions of $F-$Gordon equation; A
PDE which appears in differential geometry and relativistic field theory.
