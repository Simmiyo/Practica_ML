Surfaces with flat normal bundle: an explicit construction
An explicit construction of surfaces with flat normal bundle in the Euclidean
space (unit hypersphere) in terms of solutions of certain linear system is
proposed. In the case of 3-space our formulae can be viewed as the direct Lie
sphere analog of the generalized Weierstrass representation of surfaces in
conformal geometry or the Lelieuvre representation of surfaces in the affine
space.
  An explicit parametrization of Ribaucour congruences of spheres by three
solutions of the linear system is obtained. In view of the classical Lie
correspondence between Ribaucour congruences and surfaces with flat normal
bundle in the Lie quadric this gives an explicit representation of surfaces
with flat normal bundle in the 4-dimensional space form of the Lorentzian
signature. Direct projective analog of this construction is the known
parametrization of W-congruences by three solutions of the Moutard equation.
Under the Pl\"ucker embedding W-congruences give rise to surfaces with flat
normal bundle in the Pl\"ucker quadric.
  Integrable evolutions of surfaces with flat normal bundle and parallels with
the theory of nonlocal Hamiltonian operators of hydrodynamic type are discussed
in the conclusion.
