The intrinsic geometry of a Jordan domain
For a Jordan domain in the plane the length metric space of points connected
to an interior point by a curve of finite length is a CAT(0)space and Gromov
hyperbolic. With respect to the cone topology, that space plus its boundary at
infinity is topologically the same as the original Jordan domain.
