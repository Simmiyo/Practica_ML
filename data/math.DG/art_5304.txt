The second coefficient of the asymptotic expansion of the Bergman kernel
  of the Hodge-Dolbeault operator
We calculate the second coefficient of the asymptotic expansion of the
Bergman kernel of the Hodge-Dolbeault operator associated to high powers of a
Hermitian line bundle with non-degenerate curvature, using the method of formal
power series developed by Ma and Marinescu.
