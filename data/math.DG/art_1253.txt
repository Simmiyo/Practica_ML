Algebraic Nijenhuis operators and Kronecker Poisson pencils
We give a criterion of (micro-)kroneckerity of the linear Poisson pencil on
$\frak{g}^*$ related to an algebraic Nijenhuis operator $N:\frak{g}\to
\frak{g}$ on a finite-dimensional Lie algebra $\frak{g}$. As an application we
get a series of examples of completely integrable systems on semisimple Lie
algebras related to Borel subalgebras and a new proof of the complete
integrability of the free rigid body system on $\frak{gl}_n$.
