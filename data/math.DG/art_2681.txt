Hypersurfaces of Constant Curvature in Hyperbolic Space II
We find complete hypersurfaces of constant curvature in hyperbolic space with
a prescribed asymptotic boundary at infinity for a general class of (elliptic)
curvature functions which includes the higher order mean curvatures and their
curvature quotients.
