Addendum to "Classification of irreducible holonomies of torsion-free
  affine connection"
The real form Spin(6,H) in End(R^{32}) of Spin(12,C) in End(C^{32}) is
absolutely irreducible and thus satisfies the algebraic identities (40) and
(41). Therefore, it also occurs as an exotic holonomy and the associated
supermanifold M_g admits a SUSY-invariant polynomial. This real form has been
erroneously omitted in our paper.
  Also, the two real four-dimensional exotic holonomies, whose occurrences were
un known at the time of writing, have been shown to exist very recently by R.
