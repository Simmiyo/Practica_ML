Compact Gradient Shrinking Ricci Solitons with Positive Curvature
  Operator
In this paper, we study the following conjecture of Hamilton: Any compact
gradient shrinking Ricci soliton with positive curvature operator must be
Einstein. We first derive several identities. Then we show that the conjecture
is true under an additional condition. Furthermore, such a soliton must be of
constant curvature.
