Complete gradient shrinking Ricci solitons with pinched curvature
We prove that any $n$--dimensional complete gradient Ricci soliton with
pinched Weyl curvature is a finite quotient of $\RR^{n}$, $\RR \times
\SS^{n-1}$ or $\SS^{n}$. In particular, we do not need to assume the metric to
be locally conformally flat.
