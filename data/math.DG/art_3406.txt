Commuting Isometries of the Complex Hyperbolic Space
Let $H^n$ denote the complex hyperbolic space of dimension $n$. The group
$U(n,1)$ acts as the group of isometries of $H^n$. In this paper we investigate
when two isometries of the complex hyperbolic space commute. Along the way we
determine the centralizers.
