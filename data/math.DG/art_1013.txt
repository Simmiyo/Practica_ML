Contact Schwarzian Derivatives
H. Sato introduced a Schwarzian derivative of a contactomorphism of
three-dimensional Euclidean space and with T. Ozawa described its basic
properties. In this note their construction is extended to all odd dimensions
and to non-flat contact projective structures. The contact projective
Schwarzian derivative of a contact projective structure is defined to be a
cocycle of the contactomorphism group measuring the extent to which a
contactomorphism fails to be an automorphism of the contact projective
structure. For the flat model contact projective structure this gives a contact
Schwarzian derivative associating to a contactomorphism of Euclidean space a
tensor which vanishes if and only if the given contactomorphism is an element
of the linear symplectic group acting by linear fractional transformations.
