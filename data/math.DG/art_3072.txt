Wave equations and the LeBrun-Mason correspondence
The LeBrun-Mason twistor correspondences for $S^1$-invariant self-dual
Zollfrei metrics are explicitly established. We give explicit formulas for the
general solutions of the wave equation and the monopole equation on the de
Sitter three-space under the assumption for the tameness at infinity by using
Radon-type integral transforms, and the above twistor correspondence is
described by using these formulas. We also obtain a critical condition for the
LeBrun-Mason twistor spaces, and show that the twistor theory does not work
well for twistor spaces which do not satisfy this condition.
