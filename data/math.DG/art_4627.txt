Splitting theorems on complete manifolds with Bakry-Émery curvature
In this paper we study some splitting properties on complete noncompact
manifolds with smooth measures when $\infty$-dimensional Bakry-\'Emery Ricci
curvature is bounded from below by some negative constant and spectrum of the
weighted Laplacian has a positive lower bound. These results extend the cases
of Ricci curvature and $m$-dimensional Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature.
