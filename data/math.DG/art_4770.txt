Nonnegatively curved homogeneous metrics obtained by scaling fibers of
  submersions
We consider invariant Riemannian metrics on compact homogeneous spaces G/H
where an intermediate subgroup K between G and H exists, so that the
homogeneous space G/H is the total space of a Riemannian submersion. We study
the question as to whether enlarging the fibers of the submersion by a constant
scaling factor retains the nonnegative curvature in the case that the
deformation starts at a normal homogeneous metric. We classify triples of
groups (H,K,G) where nonnegative curvature is maintained for small
deformations, using a criterion proved by Schwachh\"ofer and Tapp. We obtain a
complete classification in case the subgroup H has full rank and an almost
complete classification in the case of regular subgroups.
