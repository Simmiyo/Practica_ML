Ruled Austere Submanifolds of Dimension Four
We classify 4-dimensional austere submanifolds in Euclidean space ruled by
2-planes. The algebraic possibilities for second fundamental forms of an
austere 4-fold M were classified by Bryant, falling into three types which we
label A, B, and C. We show that if M is 2-ruled of Type A, then the ruling map
from M into the Grassmannian of 2-planes in R^n is holomorphic, and we give a
construction for M starting with a holomorphic curve in an appropriate twistor
space. If M is 2-ruled of Type B, then M is either a generalized helicoid in
R^6 or the product of two classical helicoids in R^3. If M is 2-ruled of Type
C, then M is either a one of the above, or a generalized helicoid in R^7. We
also construct examples of 2-ruled austere hypersurfaces in R^5 with degenerate
Gauss map.
