Closed self-shrinking surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$ via the torus
We construct many closed, embedded mean curvature self-shrinking surfaces
$\Sigma_g^2\subseteq\mathbb{R}^3$ of high genus $g=2k$, $k\in \mathbb{N}$. Each
of these shrinking solitons has isometry group equal to the dihedral group on
$2g$ elements, and comes from the "gluing", i.e. desingularizing of the
singular union, of the two known closed embedded self-shrinkers in
$\mathbb{R}^3$: The round 2-sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$, and Angenent's
self-shrinking 2-torus $\mathbb{T}^2$ of revolution. This uses the results and
methods N. Kapouleas developed for minimal surfaces in \cite{Ka97}--\cite{Ka}.
