Analogues of Complex Geometry
We prove that there are no pseudoholomorphic theories of anything other than
curves, even if one allows more general spaces than almost complex manifolds.
The proof is elementary, except for theories of pseudoholomorphic
hypersurfaces, where topological techniques are needed. Surprisingly,
hypersurface theories exist ``microlocally'' (in great abundance) to all orders
perturbatively, but not ``locally.''
