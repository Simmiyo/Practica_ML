Two remarks on $PQ^ε$-projectivity of Riemannian metrics
We show that $PQ^{\epsilon}$-projectivity of two Riemannian metrics
introduced in \cite{Top2003} implies affine equivalence of the metrics unless
$\epsilon\in\{0,-1,-3,-5,-7,...\}$. Moreover, we show that for $\epsilon=0$,
$PQ^{\epsilon}$-projectivity implies projective equivalence.
