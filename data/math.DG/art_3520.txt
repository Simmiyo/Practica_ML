Semi-invariant submersions from almost Hermitian manifolds
We introduce semi-invariant Riemannian submersions from almost Hermitian
manifolds onto Riemannian manifolds. We give examples, investigate the geometry
of foliations which are arisen from the definition of a Riemannian submersion
and find necessary-sufficient conditions for total manifold to be locally
product Riemannian manifold. We also find necessary and sufficient conditions
for a semi-invariant submersion to be totally geodesic. Moreover, we obtain a
classification for semi-invariant submersions with totally umbilical fibers and
show that such submersions put some restrictions on total manifolds.
