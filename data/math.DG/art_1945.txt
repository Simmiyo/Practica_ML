Singular Holonomy of Singular Riemannian Foliations with Sections
In this paper we review some author's results about singular holonomy of
singular riemannian foliations with sections (s.r.f.s for short) and also some
results of a joint work with Toeben and a joint work with Gorodski. We stress
here that the condition that the leaves are compact, used in some of these
results, can be replaced by the condition that the leaves are closed embedded.
We also briefly recall some of Toeben's results about blow-up of s.r.f.s. Then
we use this technique to get conditions under which a holonomy map can be
extended to a global isometry.
