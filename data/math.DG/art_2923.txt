Finsler manifolds with non-Riemannian holonomy
The aim of this paper is to show that holonomy properties of Finsler
manifolds can be very different from those of Riemannian manifolds. We prove
that the holonomy group of a positive definite non-Riemannian Finsler manifold
of non-zero constant curvature with dimension >2 cannot be a compact Lie group.
Hence this holonomy group does not occur as the holonomy group of any
Riemannian manifold. In addition, we provide an example of left invariant
Finsler metric on the Heisenberg group, so that its holonomy group is not a
(finite dimensional) Lie group. These results give a positive answer to the
following problem formulated by S. S. Chern and Z. Shen: "Is there a Finsler
manifold whose holonomy group is not the holonomy group of any Riemannian
manifold?"
