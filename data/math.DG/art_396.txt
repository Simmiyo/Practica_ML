A Dolbeault-type Double Complex on Quaternionic Manifolds
It has long been known that differential forms on complex manifolds can be
decomposed under the action of the complex structure to give the Dolbeault
complex.
  This paper presents an analogous double complex for quaternionic manifolds
using the fact that the cotangent space is isomorphic to a quaternionic vector
space. This defines an action of the group Sp(1) of unit quaternions on the
cotangent space, which induces an action of Sp(1) on the space of k-forms. A
double complex is obtained by decomposing the k-forms into irreducible
representations of Sp(1), resulting in new 'quaternionic Dolbeault' operators
and cohomology groups.
  Links with previous work in quaternionic geometry, particularly the
differential complex of Salamon and the q-holomorphic functions of Joyce, are
demonstrated.
