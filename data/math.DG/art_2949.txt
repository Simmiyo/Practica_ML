Lattices in contact Lie groups and 5-dimensional contact solvmanifolds
This paper investigates the geometry of compact contact manifolds that are
uniformized by contact Lie groups, i.e., compact manifolds that are the
quotient of some Lie group G with a left invariant contact structure and a
uniform lattice subgroup. We re-examine Alexander's criteria for existence of
lattices on solvable Lie groups and apply them, along with some other well
known tools, and use these results to prove that, in dimension 5, there are
exactly seven connected and simply connected contact Lie groups with uniform
lattices, all of which are solvable. Issues of symplectic boundaries are
explored, as well. It is also shown that the special affine group has no
uniform lattice.
