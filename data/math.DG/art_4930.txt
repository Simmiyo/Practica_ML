Anti-self-dual orbifolds with cyclic quotient singularities
An index theorem for the anti-self-dual deformation complex on anti-self-dual
orbifolds with cyclic quotient singularities is proved. We present two
applications of this theorem. The first is to compute the dimension of the
deformation space of the Calderbank-Singer scalar-flat Kahler toric ALE spaces.
A corollary of this is that, except for the Eguchi-Hanson metric, all of these
spaces admit non-toric anti-self-dual deformations, thus yielding many new
examples of anti-self-dual ALE spaces. For our second application, we compute
the dimension of the deformation space of the canonical Bochner-Kahler metric
on any weighted projective space $\mathbb{CP}^2_{(r,q,p)}$ for relatively prime
integers $1 < r < q < p$. A corollary of this is that, while these metrics are
rigid as Bochner-Kahler metrics, infinitely many of these admit non-trival
self-dual deformations, yielding a large class of new examples of self-dual
orbifold metrics on certain weighted projective spaces.
