Existence and non-existence results for a logistic-type equation on
  manifolds
We study the steady state solutions of a generalized logistic type equation
on a complete Riemannian manifold. We provide sufficient conditions for
existence, respectively non-existence of positive solutions, which depend on
the relative size of the coefficients and their mutual interaction with the
geometry of the manifold, which is mostly taken into account by means of
conditions on the volume growth of geodesic balls.
