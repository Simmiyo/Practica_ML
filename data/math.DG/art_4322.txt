Penrose-type inequalities with a Euclidean background
The Riemannian Penrose inequality (RPI) bounds from below the ADM mass of
asymptotically flat manifolds of nonnegative scalar curvature in terms of the
total area of all outermost compact minimal surfaces. The general form of the
RPI is currently known for manifolds of dimension up to seven. In the present
work, we prove a Penrose-like inequality that is valid in all dimensions, for
conformally flat manifolds. Our inequality treats the area contributions of the
minimal surfaces in a more favorable way than the RPI, at the expense of using
the smaller Euclidean area (rather than the intrinsic area). We give an example
in which our estimate is sharper than the RPI when many minimal surfaces are
present. We do not require the minimal surfaces to be outermost.
  We also generalize the technique to allow for metrics conformal to a
scalar-flat (not necessarily Euclidean) background, and prove a Penrose-type
inequality without an assumption on the sign of scalar curvature. Finally, we
derive a new lower bound for the ADM mass of a conformally flat, asymptotically
flat manifold containing any number of zero area singularities.
