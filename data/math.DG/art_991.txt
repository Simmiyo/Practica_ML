Global existence and convergence for a higher order flow in conformal
  geometry
We study a higher-order parabolic equation which generalizes the Ricci flow
on two-dimensional surfaces. The metric is deformed conformally with a speed
given by the Q-curvature of the metric. Under a condition on the Q-curvature of
the initial metric we show that the soluton exists for all time and converges
to a metric of prescribed Q-curvature.
