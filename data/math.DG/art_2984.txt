Stability of $(α,β,γ)-$derivations on Lie $C^*-$algebras
Petr Novotn\'y and Ji\v{r}\'l Hrivn\'ak \cite{Nov} investigated generalize
the concept of Lie derivations via certain complex parameters and obtained
various Lie and Jordan operator algebras as well as two one- parametric sets of
linear operators. Moreover, they established the structure and properties of
$(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)-$derivations of Lie algebras. We say a functional
equation $(\xi)$ is stable if any function $g$ satisfying the equation $(\xi)$
{\it approximately} is near to true solution of $(\xi).$ In the present paper,
we investigate the stability of $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)-$derivations on Lie
$C^*$-algebras associated with the following functional equation
$$f(\frac{x_2-x_1}{3})+f(\frac{x_1-3 x_3}{3})+
f(\frac{3x_1+3x_3-x_2}{3})=f(x_1).$$ }
