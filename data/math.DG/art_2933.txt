Geometric realizations of curvature
We study geometric realization questions of curvature in the affine,
Riemannian, almost Hermitian, almost para Hermitian, almost hyper Hermitian,
almost hyper para Hermitian, Hermitian, and para Hermitian settings. We also
express questions in Ivanov-Petrova geometry, Osserman geometry, and curvature
homogeneity in terms of geometric realizations.
