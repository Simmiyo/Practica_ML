Ricci Flow with Surgery on Four-manifolds with Positive Isotropic
  Curvature
In this paper we study the Ricci flow on compact four-manifolds with positive
isotropic curvature and with no essential incompressible space form. Our
purpose is two-fold. One is to give a complete proof of Hamilton's
classification theorem on four-manifolds with positive isotropic curvature and
with no essential incompressible space form; the other is to extend some recent
results of Perelman on the three-dimensional Ricci flow to four-manifolds.
During the the proof we have actually provided, up to slight modifications, all
necessary details for the part from Section 1 to Section 5 of Perelman's second
paper on the Ricci flow.
