K-stability and parabolic stability
Parabolic structures with rational weights encode certain iterated blowups of
geometrically ruled surfaces. In this paper, we show that the three notions of
parabolic polystability, K-polystability and existence of constant scalar
curvature K\"ahler metrics on the iterated blowup are equivalent, for certain
polarizations close to the boundary of the K\"ahler cone.
