On the Inner Curvature of the Second Fundamental Form of a Surface in
  the Hyperbolic Space
The object of study of this article is compact surfaces in the
three-dimensional hyperbolic space with a positive-definite second fundamental
form. It is shown that several conditions on the Gaussian curvature of the
second fundamental form can be satisfied only by extrinsic spheres.
