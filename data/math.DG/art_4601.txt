Toric Kähler-Einstein metrics and convex compact polytopes
We show that any compact convex simple lattice polytope is the moment
polytope of a K\"ahler-Einstein orbifold, unique up to orbifold covering and
homothety. We extend the Wang-Zhu Theorem \cite{WZ} giving the existence of a
K\"ahler-Ricci soliton on any toric monotone manifold on any compact convex
simple labelled polytope satisfying the combinatoric condition corresponding to
monotonicity. We obtain that any compact convex simple polytope $P\subset
\bR^n$ admits a set of inward normals, unique up to dilatation, such that there
exists a symplectic potential satisfying the Guillemin boundary condition (with
respect to these normals) and the K\"ahler-Einstein equation on $P\times
\bR^n$. We interpret our result in terms of existence of singular
K\"ahler-Einstein metrics on toric manifolds.
