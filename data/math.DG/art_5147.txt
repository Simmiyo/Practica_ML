Normal cycles and curvature measures of sets with d.c. boundary
We show that for every compact domain in a Euclidean space with d.c.
(delta-convex) boundary there exists a unique Legendrian cycle such that the
associated curvature measures fulfil a local version of the Gauss-Bonnet
formula. This was known in dimensions two and three and was open in higher
dimensions. In fact, we show this property for a larger class of sets including
also lower-dimensional sets. We also describe the local index function of the
Legendrian cycles and we show that the associated curvature measures fulfill
the Crofton formula.
