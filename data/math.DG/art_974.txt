Unitarization of monodromy representations and constant mean curvature
  trinoids in 3-dimensional space forms
We present a theorem on the unitarizability of loop group valued monodromy
representations and apply this to show the existence of new families of
constant mean curvature surfaces homeomorphic to a thrice-punctured sphere in
the simply-connected 3-dimensional space forms $\R^3$, $\bbS^3 $ and $\bbH^3$.
Additionally, we compute the extended frame for any associated family of
Delaunay surfaces.
