Two Categories of Dirac Manifolds
We define two categories of Dirac manifolds, i.e. manifolds with complex
Dirac structures. The first notion of maps I call \emph{Dirac maps}, and the
category of Dirac manifolds is seen to contain the categories of Poisson and
complex manifolds as full subcategories. The second notion, \emph{dual-Dirac
maps}, defines a \emph{dual-Dirac category} which contains presymplectic and
complex manifolds as full subcategories. The dual-Dirac maps are stable under
B-transformations. In particular we get two structures of a category on
Hitchin'sgeneralized complex manifolds, i.e., two reasonable notions of
generalized complex maps. We also generalize further to get categories of Dirac
manifolds for which the Dirac structures lie in arbitrary exact Courant
algebroids. As an example, we consider the case of a Lie group with a complex
Dirac structure and establish conditions for which multiplication is a Dirac
map.
