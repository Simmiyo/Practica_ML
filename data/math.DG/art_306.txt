The volume and lengths on a three sphere
We show that the volume of any Riemannian metric on a three sphere is bounded
below by the length of the shortest closed curve that links its antipodal
image. In particular, the volume is bounded below by the minimum of the length
of the shortest closed geodesic and the minimal distance between antipodal
points.
