On algebraic torsion forms and their spin holonomy algebras
We study holonomy algebras generated by an algebraic element of the Clifford
algebra, or equivalently, the holonomy algebras of certain spin connections in
flat space. We provide series of examples in arbitrary dimensions and establish
general properties of the holonomy algebras under some mild conditions on the
generating element. We show that the first non-standard situation to look at
appears in dimension 8 and concerns self-dual 4-forms. In this case complete
structure results are obtained.
