P-connection on Riemannian almost product manifolds
In the present work, we introduce a linear connection (preserving the almost
product structure and the Riemannian metric) on Riemannian almost product
manifolds. This connection, called P-connection, is an analogue of the first
canonical connection of Lichnerowicz in the Hermitian geometry and the
B-connection in the geometry of the almost complex manifolds with Norden
metric. Particularly, we consider the P-connection on a the class of manifolds
with nonintegrable almost product structure.
