Geometric properties of Lagrangian mechanical systems
The geometry of a Lagrangian mechanical system is determined by its
associated evolution semispray. We uniquely determine this semispray using the
symplectic structure and the energy of the Lagrange space and the external
force field. We study the variation of the energy and Lagrangian functions
along the evolution and the horizontal curves and give conditions by which
these variations vanish. We provide examples of mechanical systems which are
dissipative and for which the evolution nonlinear connection is either metric
or symplectic.
