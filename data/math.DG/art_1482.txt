Geometric aspects of higher order variational principles on submanifolds
The geometry of jets of submanifolds is studied, with special interest in the
relationship with the calculus of variations. A new intrinsic geometric
formulation of the variational problem on jets of submanifolds is given.
Working examples are provided.
