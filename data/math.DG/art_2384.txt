A class of Lorentzian manifolds with indecomposable holonomy groups
We consider a class of $S^{1}$-bundles whose total space admits a nowhere
vanishing recurrent lightlike vector field with respect to a Lorentzian metric.
This metric can be modified such that its restricted holonomy group is
indecomposable and reducible. We apply Hodge theory to construct examples with
Hermitian screen holonomy. Finally, we construct complete pp-waves.
