Manifolds without 1/k-geodesic
It is a question by C.Sormani that whether there exists a $k \in \mathbb N$,
such that any compact, smooth and simply connected manifold has a 1/k-geodesic.
We prove in this paper that this is not true by showing for each $k$, there
exists a metric on the sphere such that it has no 1/k-geodesic.
