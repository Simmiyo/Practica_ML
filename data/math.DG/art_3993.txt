Poisson brackets with prescribed Casimirs
We consider the problem of constructing Poisson brackets on smooth manifolds
$M$ with prescribed Casimir functions. If $M$ is of even dimension, we achieve
our construction by considering a suitable almost symplectic structure on $M$,
while, in the case where $M$ is of odd dimension, our objective is achieved by
using a convenient almost cosymplectic structure. Several examples and
applications are presented.
