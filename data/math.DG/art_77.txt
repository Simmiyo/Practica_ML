Fukaya Floer homology of $Σ\times S^1$ and applications
We determine the Fukaya Floer homology of the three-manifold which is the
product of a Riemann surface of genus $g\geq 1$ times the circle. This sets up
the groundwork for finding the structure of the Donaldson invariants of
four-manifolds not of simple type in the future. We give the following
applications: 1) We show that every four-manifold with $b^+>1$ is of finite
type. 2) Some results relevant to Donaldson invariants of connected sums along
surfaces. 3) We find the invariants of the product of two Riemann surfaces both
of genus greater or equal than one.
