A New Approach on Constant Angle Surfaces in E^3
In this paper we study constant angle surfaces in Euclidean 3-space. Even
that the result is a consequence of some classical results involving the Gauss
map (of the surface), we give another approach to classify all surfaces for
which the unit normal makes a constant angle with a fixed direction.
