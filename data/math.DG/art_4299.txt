Harmonic diffeomorphisms between domains in the Euclidean 2-sphere
We study the existence or not of harmonic diffeomorphisms between certain
domains in the Euclidean 2-sphere. In particular, we show harmonic
diffeomorphisms from circular domains in the complex plane onto finitely
punctured spheres, with at least two punctures. This result follows from a
general existence theorem for maximal graphs in the Lorentzian product
$M\times\mathbb{R}_1,$ where $M$ is an arbitrary $n$-dimensional compact
Riemannian manifold, $n\geq 2.$ In contrast, we show that there is no harmonic
diffeomorphism from the unit complex disc onto the once punctured sphere and no
harmonic diffeomeorphisms from finitely punctured spheres onto circular domains
in the Euclidean 2-sphere.
