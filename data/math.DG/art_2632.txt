Geometric aspects of transversal Killing spinors on Riemannian flows
We study a Killing spinor type equation on spin Riemannian flows. We prove
integrability conditions and partially classify those Riemannian flows $M$
carrying non-trivial solutions to that equation in case $M$ is a local
Riemannian product, a Sasakian manifold or 3-dimensional.
