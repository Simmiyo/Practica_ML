Complex valued Ray--Singer torsion II
In this paper we extend Witten-Helffer-Sj\"ostrand theory from selfadjoint
Laplacians based on fiber wise Hermitian structures, to non-selfadjoint
Laplacians based on fiber wise non-degenerate symmetric bilinear forms. As an
application we verify, up to sign, the conjecture about the comparison of the
Milnor-Turaev torsion with the complex valued analytic torsion, for odd
dimensional manifolds. This is done along the lines of Burghelea, Friedlander
and Kappeler's proof of the Cheeger-M\"uller theorem.
