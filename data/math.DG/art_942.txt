Integration of simplicial forms and Deligne cohomology
We present two approaches to constructing an integration map for smooth
Deligne cohomology. The first is defined in the simplicial model, where a class
in Deligne cohomology is represented by a simplicial form, and the second in a
related but more combinatorial model.
