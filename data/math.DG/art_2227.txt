Calabi-Yau cones from contact reduction
We consider a generalization of Einstein-Sasaki manifolds, which we
characterize in terms both of spinors and differential forms, that in the real
analytic case corresponds to contact manifolds whose symplectic cone is
Calabi-Yau. We construct solvable examples in seven dimensions. Then, we
consider circle actions that preserve the structure, and determine conditions
for the contact reduction to carry an induced structure of the same type. We
apply this construction to obtain a new hypo-contact structure on S^2\times
T^3.
