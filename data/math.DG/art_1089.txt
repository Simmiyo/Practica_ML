The embedded singly periodic Scherk-Costa surfaces
We give a positive answer to M. Traizet's open question about the existence
of complete embedded minimal surfaces with Scherk-ends without planar
geodesics. In the singly periodic case, these examples get close to an
extension of Traizet's result concerning asymmetric complete minimal
submanifolds of Euclidean space with finite total curvature.
