Compact pseudo-Riemannian manifolds with parallel Weyl tensor
It is shown that in every dimension n=3j+2, j=1,2,3,..., there exist compact
pseudo-Riemannian manifolds with parallel Weyl tensor, which are
Ricci-recurrent, but neither conformally flat nor locally symmetric, and
represent all indefinite metric signatures. The manifolds in question are
diffeomorphic to nontrivial torus bundles over the circle. They all arise from
a construction that a priori yields bundles over the circle, having as the
fibre either a torus, or a 2-step nilmanifold with a complete flat torsionfree
connection; our argument only realizes the torus case.
