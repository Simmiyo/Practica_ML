The gluing formula of the refined analytic torsion for an acyclic
  Hermitian connection
In the previous work ([14]) we introduced the well-posed boundary conditions
${\mathcal P}_{-, {\mathcal L}_{0}}$ and ${\mathcal P}_{+, {\mathcal L}_{1}}$
for the odd signature operator to define the refined analytic torsion on a
compact manifold with boundary. In this paper we discuss the gluing formula of
the refined analytic torsion for an acyclic Hermitian connection with respect
to the boundary conditions ${\mathcal P}_{-, {\mathcal L}_{0}}$ and ${\mathcal
P}_{+, {\mathcal L}_{1}}$. In this case the refined analytic torsion consists
of the Ray-Singer analytic torsion, the eta invariant and the values of the
zeta functions at zero. We first compare the Ray-Singer analytic torsion and
eta invariant subject to the boundary condition ${\mathcal P}_{-, {\mathcal
L}_{0}}$ or ${\mathcal P}_{+, {\mathcal L}_{1}}$ with the Ray-Singer analytic
torsion subject to the relative (or absolute) boundary condition and eta
invariant subject to the APS boundary condition on a compact manifold with
boundary. Using these results together with the well known gluing formula of
the Ray-Singer analytic torsion subject to the relative and absolute boundary
conditions and eta invariant subject to the APS boundary condition, we obtain
the main result.
