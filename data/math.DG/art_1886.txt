Non Kaehler solvmanifolds with generalized Kaehler structure
We construct a compact 6-dimensional solvmanifold endowed with a non-trivial
invariant generalized K\"ahler structure and which does not admit any K\"ahler
metric. This is in contrast with the case of nilmanifolds which cannot admit
any invariant generalized K\"ahler structure unless they are tori.
