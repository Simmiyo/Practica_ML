Symmetry of Quadratic Homogeneous Differential Systems
In this paper, the symmetry group of a differential system of n quadratic
homogeneous first order ODEs of n variables is studied. For this purpose, we
consider the action of both point and contact transformations to signify the
corresponding Lie algebras. We also find the independent differential
invariants of these actions.
