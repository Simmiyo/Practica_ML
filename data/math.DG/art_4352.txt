On surfaces in three dimensional contact manifolds
In this paper, we introduce two notions on a surface in a contact manifold.
The first one is called degree of transversality (DOT) which measures the
transversality between the tangent spaces of a surface and the contact planes.
The second quantity, called curvature of transversality (COT), is designed to
give a comparison principle for DOT along characteristic curves under bounds on
COT. In particular, this gives estimates on lengths of characteristic curves
assuming COT is bounded below by a positive constant.
  We show that surfaces with constant COT exist and we classify all graphs in
the Heisenberg group with vanishing COT. This is accomplished by showing that
the equation for graphs with zero COT can be decomposed into two first order
PDEs, one of which is the backward invisicid Burgers' equation. Finally we show
that the p-minimal graph equation in the Heisenberg group also has such a
decomposition. Moreover, we can use this decomposition to write down an
explicit formula of a solution near a regular point.
