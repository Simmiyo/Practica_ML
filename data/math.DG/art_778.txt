Singular reduction for nonlinear control systems
We discuss smooth nonlinear control systems with symmetry. For a free and
proper action of the symmetry group, the reduction of symmetry gives rise to a
reduced smooth nonlinear control system. If the action of the symmetry group is
only proper, the reduced nonlinear control system need not be smooth. Using the
smooth calculus on nonsmooth spaces, provided by the theory of differential
spaces of Sikorski, we prove a generalization of Sussmann's theorem on orbits
of families of smooth vector fields.
