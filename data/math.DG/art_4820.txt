Deforming submanifolds of arbitrary codimension in a sphere
In this paper, we prove some convergence theorems for the mean curvature flow
of closed submanifolds in the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n+d}$ under integral
curvature conditions. As a consequence, we obtain several differentiable sphere
theorems for certain submanifolds in $\mathbb{S}^{n+d}$.
