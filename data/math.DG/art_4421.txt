Hypersurfaces of constant higher order mean curvature in warped products
In this paper we characterize compact and complete hypersurfaces with some
constant higher order mean curvature into warped product spaces. Our approach
is based on the use of a new trace operator version of the Omori-Yau maximum
principle which seems to be interesting in its own.
