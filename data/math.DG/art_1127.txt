Infinite Periodic Discrete Minimal Surfaces Without Self-Intersections
A triangulated piecewise-linear minimal surface in Euclidean 3-space defined
using a variational characterization is critical for area amongst all
continuous piecewise-linear variations with compact support that preserve the
simplicial structure. We explicitly construct examples of such surfaces that
are embedded and are periodic in three independent directions of Euclidean
3-space.
