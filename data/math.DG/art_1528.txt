Deformations Einstein infinitesimales de cones-varietes hyperboliques
Starting with a compact hyperbolic cone-manifold of dimension n > 2, we study
the deformations of the metric in order to get Einstein cone-manifolds. If the
singular locus is a closed codimension 2 submanifold and all cone angles are
smaller than 2 pi, we show that there is no non-trivial infinitesimal Einstein
deformations preserving the cone angles. This result can be interpreted as a
higher-dimensional case of the celebrated Hodgson and Kerckhoff's theorem on
deformations of hyperbolic 3-cone-manifolds. If all cone angles are smaller
than pi, we then give a construction which associates to any variation of the
angles a corresponding infinitesimal Einstein deformation. We also show that
these deformations are smooth on the singular locus.
