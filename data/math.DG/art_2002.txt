The Nahm transform for calorons
In this paper, we complete the proof of an equivalence given by Nye and
Singer of the equivalence between calorons (instantons on $S^1\times R^3$) and
solutions to Nahm's equations over the circle, both satisfying appropriate
boundary conditions. Many of the key ingredients are provided by a third way of
encoding the same data which involves twistors and complex geometry.
