Some Characterizations of Rectifying Spacelike Curves in the Minkowski
  Space-Time
In this paper, we define a rectifying spacelike curve in the Minkowski
space-time $E_1^4$ as a curve whose position vector always lies in orthogonal
complement $N^{\bot}$ of its principal normal vector field $N$. In particular,
we study the rectifying spacelike curves in $E_1^4$ and characterize such
curves in terms of their curvature functions.
