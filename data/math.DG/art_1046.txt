Stable tangential families and singularities of their envelopes
We study tangential families, i.e. systems of rays emanating tangentially
from given curves. We classify, up to Left-Right equivalence, stable
singularities of tangential family germs (under deformations among tangential
families) and we study their envelopes. We discuss applications of our results
to the case of tangent geodesics of a curve.
