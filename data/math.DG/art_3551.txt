Projective spherically symmetric Finsler metrics with constant flag
  curvature in R^n
We investigate projective spherically symmetric Finsler metrics with constant
flag curvature in $R^n$ and give the complete classification theorems.
Furthermore, a new class of Finsler metrics with two parameters on
n-dimensional disk are found to have constant negative flag curvature.
