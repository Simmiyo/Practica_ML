On moduli spaces of Ricci solitons
We study deformations of shrinking Ricci solitons on a compact manifold M,
generalising the classical theory of deformations of Einstein metrics. Using
appropriate notions of twisted slices S_f inside the space of all Riemannian
metrics on M, we define the infinitesimal solitonic deformations and the local
solitonic pre-moduli spaces. We prove the existence of a finite dimensional
submanifold of S_f x C^infty(M), which contains the pre-moduli space of
solitons around a fixed shrinking Ricci soliton as an analytic subset. We
define solitonic rigidity and give criteria which imply it.
