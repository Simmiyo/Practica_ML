Formal Frobenius manifold structure on equivariant cohomology
For a closed K\"{a}hler manifold with a Hamiltonian action of a connected
compact Lie group by holomorphic isometries, we construct a formal Frobenius
manifold structure on the equivariant cohomology by exploiting a natural DGBV
algebra structure on the Cartan model.
