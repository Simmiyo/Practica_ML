On commutators of equivariant homeomorphisms
The long-standing problem of the perfectness of the compactly supported
equivariant homeomorphism group on a $G$-manifold (with one orbit type) is
solved in the affirmative. The proof is based on an argument different than
that for the case of diffeomorphisms. The theorem is a starting point for
computing $H_1(\mathcal{H}_G(M))$ for more complicated $G$-manifolds.
