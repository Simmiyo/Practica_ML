Time-like constant slope surfaces and space-like Bertrand curves in
  Minkowski 3-space
Defining Lorentzian Sabban frame of the unit speed time-like curves on de
Sitter 2-space $\mathbb{S}^{2}_{1}$ and introducing space-like height function
on the unit speed time-like curves on $\mathbb{S}^{2}_{1}$, the invariants of
the unit speed time-like curves on $\mathbb{S}^{2}_{1}$ and geometric
properties of de Sitter evolutes of the unit speed time-like curves on
$\mathbb{S}^{2}_{1}$ are studied. A relation between space-like Bertrand curves
and helices is obtained. De Sitter Darboux images of space-like Bertrand curves
are equal to de Sitter evolutes. The relations between time-like constant slope
surfaces lying in the space-like cone and space-like Bertrand curves in
Minkowski 3-space $\mathbb{R}^{3}_{1}$ are obtained.
