Estimates for Eigenvalues of Poly-harmonic Operators
In this paper, we study eigenvalues of the poly-Laplacian with arbitrary
order on a bounded domain in an n-dimensional Euclidean space and obtain a
lower bound for eigenvalues, which generalizes the results due to Cheng-Wei [5]
and gives an improvement of results due to Cheng- Qi-Wei [3].
