Curvature dependent lower bounds for the first eigenvalue of the Dirac
  operator
Using Weitzenb\"ock techniques on any compact Riemannian spin manifold we
derive inequalities that involve a real parameter and join the eigenvalues of
the Dirac operator with curvature terms. The discussion of these inequalities
yields vanishing theorems for the kernel of the Dirac operator $D$ and lower
bounds for the spectrum of $D^2$ if the curvature satisfies certain conditions.
