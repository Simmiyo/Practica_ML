Space-like Weingarten surfaces in the three-dimensional Minkowski space
  and their natural partial differential equations
On any space-like W-surface in the three-dimensional Minkowski space we
introduce locally natural principal parameters and prove that such a surface is
determined uniquely up to motion by a special invariant function, which
satisfies a natural non-linear partial differential equation. This result can
be interpreted as a solution to the Lund-Regge reduction problem for space-like
W-surfaces in Minkowski space. We apply this theory to linear fractional
space-like W-surfaces and obtain the natural non-linear partial differential
equations describing them. We obtain a characterization of space-like surfaces,
whose curvatures satisfy a linear relation, by means of their natural partial
differential equations. We obtain the ten natural PDE's describing all linear
fractional space-like W-surfaces.
