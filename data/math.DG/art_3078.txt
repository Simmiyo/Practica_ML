Canonical connection on a class of Riemannian almost product manifolds
The canonical connection on a Riemannian almost product manifold is an
analogue to the Hermitian connection on an almost Hermitian manifold. In this
paper we consider the canonical connection on a class of Riemannian almost
product manifolds with non-integrable almost product structure. We construct
and characterize an example by a Lie group.
