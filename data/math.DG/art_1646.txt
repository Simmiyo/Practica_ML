Convolution of convex valuations
We show that the natural "convolution" on the space of smooth, even,
translation-invariant convex valuations on a euclidean space $V$, obtained by
intertwining the product and the duality transform of S. Alesker, may be
expressed in terms of Minkowski sum. Furthermore the resulting product extends
naturally to odd valuations as well. Based on this technical result we give an
application to integral geometry, generalizing Hadwiger's additive kinematic
formula for $SO(V)$ to general compact groups $G \subset O(V)$ acting
transitively on the sphere: it turns out that these formulas are in a natural
sense dual to the usual (intersection) kinematic formulas.
