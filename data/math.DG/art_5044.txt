Some inequalities on hemi-slant product submanifolds in a cosymplectic
  manifold
Recently, M. Atcken studied Contact CR-warped prod- uct submanifolds in
cosymplectic space forms and established gen- eral sharp inequalities for
CR-warped products in a cosymplectic manifold [1]. In the present paper, we
obtain an inequality for the squared norm of the second fundamental form in
terms of constant ?$\phi$-sectional curvature for hemi-slant products in
cosymplectic mani- folds. An inequality for hemi-slant warped products in a
cosymplectc manifold is also given. The equality case is considered.
