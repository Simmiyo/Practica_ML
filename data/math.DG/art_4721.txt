Sobolev Metrics on Diffeomorphism Groups and the Derived Geometry of
  Spaces of Submanifolds
Given a finite dimensional manifold $N$, the group
$\operatorname{Diff}_{\mathcal S}(N)$ of diffeomorphism of $N$ which fall
suitably rapidly to the identity, acts on the manifold $B(M,N)$ of submanifolds
on $N$ of diffeomorphism type $M$ where $M$ is a compact manifold with $\dim
M<\dim N$. For a right invariant weak Riemannian metric on
$\operatorname{Diff}_{\mathcal S}(N)$ induced by a quite general operator
$L:\frak X_{\mathcal S}(N)\to \Gamma(T^*N\otimes\operatorname{vol}(N))$, we
consider the induced weak Riemannian metric on $B(M,N)$ and we compute its
geodesics and sectional curvature. For that we derive a covariant formula for
curvature in finite and infinite dimensions, we show how it makes O'Neill's
formula very transparent, and we use it finally to compute sectional curvature
on $B(M,N)$.
