Polar actions on symmetric spaces of higher rank
We show that polar actions of cohomogeneity two on simple compact Lie groups
of higher rank, endowed with a biinvariant Riemannian metric, are hyperpolar.
Combining this with a recent result of the second-named author, we are able to
prove that polar actions induced by reductive algebraic subgroups in the
isometry group of an irreducible Riemannian symmetric space of higher rank are
hyperpolar. In particular, this result affirmatively settles the conjecture
that polar actions on irreducible compact symmetric spaces of higher rank are
hyperpolar.
