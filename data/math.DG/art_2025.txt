The geometrical quantity in damped wave equations on a square
The energy in a square membrane $\Omega$ subject to constant viscous damping
on a subset $\omega\subset \Omega$ decays exponentially in time as soon as
$\omega$ satisfies a geometrical condition known as the "Bardos-Lebeau-Rauch"
condition. The rate $\tau(\omega)$ of this decay satisfies $\tau(\omega)= 2
\min(-\mu(\omega), g(\omega))$ (see Lebeau [Math. Phys. Stud. 19 (1996)
73-109]). Here $\mu(\omega)$ denotes the spectral abscissa of the damped wave
equation operator and $g(\omega)$ is a number called the geometrical quantity
of $\omega$ and defined as follows. A ray in $\Omega$ is the trajectory
generated by the free motion of a mass-point in $\Omega$ subject to elastic
reflections on the boundary. These reflections obey the law of geometrical
optics. The geometrical quantity $g(\omega)$ is then defined as the upper limit
(large time asymptotics) of the average trajectory length. We give here an
algorithm to compute explicitly $g(\omega)$ when $\omega$ is a finite union of
squares.
