Riemannian geometric realizations for Ricci tensors of generalized
  algebraic curvature operators
We examine questions of geometric realizability for algebraic structures
which arise naturally in affine and Riemannian geometry. Suppose given an
algebraic curvature operator R at a point P of a manifold M and suppose given a
real analytic (resp. C-k for finite k at least 2) pseudo-Riemannian metric on M
defined near P. We construct a torsion free real analytic (resp. C-k)
connection D which is defined near P on the tangent bundle of M whose curvature
operator is the given operator R at P and so that D has constant scalar
curvature. We show that if R is Ricci symmetric, then D can be chosen to be
Ricci symmetric; if R has trace free Ricci tensor, then D can be chosen to have
trace free Ricci tensor; if R is Ricci alternating, then D can be chosen to be
Ricci alternating.
