Vanishing theorems for associative submanifolds
Let M^7 a manifold with holonomy in G_2, and Y^3 an associative submanifold
with boundary in a coassociative submanifold. In [5], the authors proved that
M_{X,Y}, the moduli space of its associative deformations with boundary in the
fixed X, has finite virtual dimension. Using Bochner's technique, we give a
vanishing theorem that forces M_{X,Y} to be locally smooth.
