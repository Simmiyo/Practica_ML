Homogeneous hypersurfaces in complex hyperbolic spaces
We study the geometry of homogeneous hypersurfaces and their focal sets in
complex hyperbolic spaces. In particular, we provide a characterization of the
focal set in terms of its second fundamental form and determine the principal
curvatures of the homogeneous hypersurfaces together with their multiplicities.
