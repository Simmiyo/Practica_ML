The Spectral Geometry of Einstein Manifolds with Boundary
Let (M,g) be a compact Einstein manifold with smooth boundary. We consider
the spectrum of the p form valued Laplacian with respect to a suitable boundary
condition. We show that certain geometric properties of the boundary may be
spectrally characterized in terms of this data where we fix the Einstein
constant.
