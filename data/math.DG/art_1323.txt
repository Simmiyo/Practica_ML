Equivariant harmonic cylinders
We prove that a primitive harmonic map is equivariant if and only if it
admits a holomorphic potential of degree one. We investigate when the
equivariant harmonic map is periodic, and as an application discuss constant
mean curvature cylinders with screw motion symmetries.
