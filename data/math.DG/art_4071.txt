Volume preserving curvature flows in Lorentzian manifolds
Let N be a (n+1)-dimensional globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifold with a
compact Cauchy hypersurface. We consider curvature flows in N with different
curvature functions F (including the mean curvature, the gauss curvature and
the second elementary symmetric polynomial) and a volume preserving term. Under
suitable assumptions we prove the long time existence of the flow and the
exponential convergence of the corresponding graphs in the $C^\infty$-topology
to a hypersurface of constant F-curvature. Furthermore we examine stability
properties and foliations of constant F-curvature hypersurfaces.
