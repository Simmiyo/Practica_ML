Real hypersurfaces in complex and quaternionic hyperbolic spaces
We introduce curvature-adapted foliations of complex hyperbolic space and
study some of their properties. Generalized pseudo-Einstein hypersurfaces of
complex hyperbolic space are classified. Analogous results for
curvature-adapted hypersurfaces of quaternionic hyperbolic space are also
obtained.
