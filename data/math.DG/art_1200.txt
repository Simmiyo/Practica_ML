Partial Signatures and the Yoshida-Nicolaescu Theorem
In this article, we give a simple and direct proof of the Yoshida-Nicolaescu
Theorem in a more general context by using the theory of partial signatures. We
do not impose the usual condition of non-degeneracy at the endpoints and use a
natural definition of the Maslov index.
