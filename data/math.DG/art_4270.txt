On the conditions to extend Ricci flow(II)
We develop some estimates under the Ricci flow and use these estimates to
study the blowup rates of curvatures at singularities. As applications, we
obtain some gap theorems:
  $\displaystyle \sup_X |Ric|$ and $\displaystyle \sqrt{\sup_X |Rm|} \cdot
\sqrt{\sup_X |R|}$
  must blowup at least at the rate of type-I. Our estimates also imply some gap
theorems for shrinking Ricci solitons.
