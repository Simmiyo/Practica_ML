From generalized Kaehler to generalized Sasakian structures
This is an expository paper, which provides a first introduction to geometric
structures on $TM\oplus T^*M$. The paper contains definitions and
characteristic properties of generalized complex, generalized Kaehler,
generalized (normal, almost) contact and generalized Sasakian structures. A few
of these properties are new.
