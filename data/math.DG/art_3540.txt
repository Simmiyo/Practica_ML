Helicoidal surfaces in Minkowski space with constant mean curvature and
  constant Gauss curvature
In this work we find all helicoidal surfaces in Minkowski space with constant
mean curvature whose generating curve is a the graph of a polynomial or a
Lorentzian circle. In the first case, we prove that the degree of the
polynomial is $0$ or $1$ and that the surface is ruled. If the generating curve
is a Lorentzian circle, we show that the only possibility is that the axis is
spacelike and the center of the circle lies in the axis.
