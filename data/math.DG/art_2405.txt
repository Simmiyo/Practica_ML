Low Cohomogeneity and Polar Actions on Exceptional Compact Lie Groups
We study isometric Lie group actions on the compact exceptional groups E6,
E7, E8, F4 and G2 endowed with a biinvariant metric. We classify polar actions
on these groups. We determine all isometric actions of cohomogeneity less than
three on E6, E7, F4 and all isometric actions of cohomogeneity less than 20 on
E8. Moreover we determine the principal isotropy algebras for all isometric
actions on G2.
