Corrigendum for "A geometric proof of the Karpelevich-Mostow theorem"
Corollary 2.3 in our paper "A geometric proof of the Karpelevich-Mostow
theorem", Bull. Lond. Math. Soc. 41 (2009), no. 4, 634-638, is false. Here we
give a counterexample and show how to avoid the use of this corollary to give a
simpler proof of Karpelevich-Mostow theorem. We also include a short discussion
of the original proof by Karpelevich.
