On closed geodesics in the leaf spaces of singular Riemannian foliations
In this paper we survey on some recent results on Riemannian orbifolds and
singular Riemannian foliations and combine them to conclude the existence of
closed geodesics in the leaf space of some classes of singular Riemannian
foliations (s.r.f.), namely s.r.f. that admit sections or have no horizontal
conjugate points. We also investigate the shortening process with respect to
Riemannian foliations.
