The moduli space ${\cal M}_n(\Si)$ of stable fiber bundles over a
  compact Riemann surface
The moduli space of holomorphic fiber bundles ${\cal M}_n(\Si)$ over a
compact Riemann surface $\Si$ is considered.
  A formula for the regularised determinant and an other for the symplectic
form at trivial bundle are proposed.
