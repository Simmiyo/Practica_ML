Equifocal families in symmetric spaces of compact type
An equifocal submanifold M of a symmetric space N of compact type induces a
foliation with singular leaves on N. In this paper we will show how to
reconstruct the equifocal foliation starting from one of the singular leaves,
the so-called focal manifolds. To be more concrete: The equifocal submanifold
is equal to a partial tube B around the focal manifold and we will show how to
construct B in this paper. Moreover, we will find a geometrical
characterization of focal manifolds.
