Non-Discrete Complex Hyperbolic Triangle Groups of Type (m,m,infinity)
In this note we prove that a complex hyperbolic triangle group of type
(m,m,infinity), i.e. a group of isometries of the complex hyperbolic plane,
generated by complex reflections in three complex geodesics meeting at angles
Pi/m, Pi/m and 0, is not discrete if the product of the three generators is
regular elliptic.
