Some Geometric Properties of the Bakry-Emery-Ricci Tensor
The Bakry-Emery tensor gives an analog of the Ricci tensor for a Riemannian
manifold with a smooth measure. We show that some of the topological
consequences of having a positive or nonnegative Ricci tensor are also valid
for the Bakry-Emery tensor. We show that the Bakry-Emery tensor is
nondecreasing under a Riemannian submersion whose fiber transport preserves
measures up to constants. We give some relations between the Bakry-Emery tensor
and measured Gromov-Hausdorff limits.
