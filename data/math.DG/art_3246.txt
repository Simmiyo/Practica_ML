Non-existence of flat paracontact metric structures in dimension greater
  than or equal to five
An example of a three dimensional flat paracontact metric manifold with
respect to Levi-Civita connection is constructed. It is shown that no such
manifold exists for odd dimensions greater than or equal to five.
