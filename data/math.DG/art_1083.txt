Conformally invariant Cotton and Bach tensor in N-dimensions
This paper presents conformal invariants for Riemannian manifolds of
dimension greater than or equal to four whose vanishing is necessary for a
Riemannian manifold to be conformally related to an Einstein space. One of the
invariants is a modification of the Cotton tensor, the other is a
$n$--dimensional version of the Bach tensor. In general both tensors are smooth
only on an open and dense subset of $M$, but this subset is invariant under
conformal transformations. Moreover, we generalize the main result of
"Conformal Einstein Spaces in $N$--Dimensions" published in \emph{Ann. Global
Anal. Geom.} {\bf 20}(2) (2001).
