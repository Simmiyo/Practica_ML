Estimates for lower order eigenvalues of a clamped plate problem
For a bounded domain $\Omega$ in a complete Riemannian manifold $M^n$, we
study estimates for lower order eigenvalues of a clamped plate problem. We
obtain universal inequalities for lower order eigenvalues. We would like to
remark that our results are sharp.
