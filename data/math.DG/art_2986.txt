Complete Flat Surfaces with two Isolated Singularities in Hyperbolic
  3-space
We construct examples of flat surfaces in $\mathbb{H}^3$ which are graphs
over a two-punctured horosphere and classify complete embedded flat surfaces in
$\mathbb{H}^3$ with only one end and at most two isolated singularities.
