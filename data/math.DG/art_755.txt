Quasi-positive curvature on homogeneous bundles
We provide new examples of manifolds which admit a Riemannian metric with
sectional curvature nonnegative, and strictly positive at one point. Our
examples include the unit tangent bundles of $CP^n$, $HP^n$ and $CaP^2$, and a
family of lens space bundles over $CP^n$. All new examples are consequences of
a general sufficient condition for a homogeneous fiber bundle over a
homogeneous space to admit such a metric.
