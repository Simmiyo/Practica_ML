Homogeneity of proper complex equifocal submanifolds
In this paper, we show that an irreducible proper complex equifocal
submanifold of codimension greater than one in a symmetric space of non-compact
type. The proof is performed by showing the homogeneity of the lift of the
complexification of the original submanifold to some infinite dimensional
anti-Kahelerian space.
