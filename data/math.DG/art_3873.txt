Extrinsic isoperimetry and compactification of minimal surfaces in
  Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces
We study the topology of (properly) immersed complete minimal surfaces $P^2$
in Hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces which have finite total extrinsic curvature,
using some isoperimetric inequalities satisfied by the extrinsic balls in these
surfaces, (see \cite{Pa}). We present an alternative and partially unified
proof of the Chern-Osserman inequality satisfied by these minimal surfaces, (in
$\erre^n$ and in $\Han$), based in the isoperimetric analysis above alluded.
Finally, we show a Chern-Osserman type equality attained by complete minimal
surfaces in the Hyperbolic space with finite total extrinsic curvature.
