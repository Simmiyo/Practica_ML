Closure of rigid semianalytic sets
Let K be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, endowed with a
complete nonarchimedean norm. Let X be a K-rigid analytic variety and \Sigma a
semianalytic subset of X. Then the closure of \Sigma in X with respect to the
canonical topology is again semianalytic. The proof uses Embedded Resolution of
Singularities.
