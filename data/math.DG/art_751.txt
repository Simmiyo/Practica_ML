Contact Angle for Immersed Surfaces in $S^{2n+1}$
In this paper we introduce the notion of contact angle. We deduce formulas
for Laplacian and Gaussian curvature of a minimal surface in $S^{2n+1}$ and
give a characterization of the generalized Clifford Torus as the only
non-legendrian minimal surface in $S^5$ with constant Contact and Kaehler
angles.
