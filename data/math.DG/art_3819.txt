Ruled Laguerre minimal surfaces
A Laguerre minimal surface is an immersed surface in the Euclidean space
being an extremal of the functional \int (H^2/K - 1) dA. In the present paper,
we prove that the only ruled Laguerre minimal surfaces are up to isometry the
surfaces R(u,v) = (Au, Bu, Cu + D cos 2u) + v (sin u, cos u, 0), where A, B, C,
D are fixed real numbers. To achieve invariance under Laguerre transformations,
we also derive all Laguerre minimal surfaces that are enveloped by a family of
cones. The methodology is based on the isotropic model of Laguerre geometry. In
this model a Laguerre minimal surface enveloped by a family of cones
corresponds to a graph of a biharmonic function carrying a family of isotropic
circles. We classify such functions by showing that the top view of the family
of circles is a pencil.
