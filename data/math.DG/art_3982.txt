Weakly Z symmetric manifolds
We introduce a new kind of Riemannian manifold that includes weakly-, pseudo-
and pseudo projective- Ricci symmetric manifolds. The manifold is defined
through a generalization of the so called Z tensor; it is named "weakly Z
symmetric" and denoted by (WZS)_n. If the Z tensor is singular we give
conditions for the existence of a proper concircular vector. For non singular Z
tensor, we study the closedness property of the associated covectors and give
sufficient conditions for the existence of a proper concircular vector in the
conformally harmonic case, and the general form of the Ricci tensor. For
conformally flat (WZS)_n manifolds, we derive the local form of the metric
tensor.
