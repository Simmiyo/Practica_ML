Ricci flow on surfaces with conical singularities
This paper studies the normalized Ricci flow on surfaces with conical
singularities. It's proved that the normalized Ricci flow has a solution for a
short time for initial metrics with conical singularities. Moreover, the
solution makes good geometric sense. For some simple surfaces of this kind, for
example, the tear drop and the football, it's shown that they admit Ricci
soliton metric.
