On the connection theory of transitive Lie groupoids
Due to a result by Mackenzie, extensions of transitive Lie groupoids are
equivalent to certain Lie groupoids which admit an action of a Lie group. This
paper is a treatment of the equivariant connection theory and holonomy of such
groupoids, and shows that such connections give rise to the transition data
necessary for the classification of their respective Lie algebroids.
