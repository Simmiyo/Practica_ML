The fundamental form of a homogeneous Lagrangian in two independent
  variables
We construct, for a homogeneous Lagrangian of arbitrary order in two
independent variables, a differential 2-form with the property that it is
closed precisely when the Lagrangian is null. This is similar to the property
of the `fundamental Lepage equivalent' associated with first-order Lagrangians
defined on jets of sections of a fibred manifold.
