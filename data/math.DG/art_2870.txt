Ricci curvature and monopole classes on 3-manifolds
We prove an L^2-estimate involving Ricci curvature and a harmonic 1-form on a
closed oriented Riemannian 3-manifold admitting a solution of any rescaled
Seiberg-Witten equations. We also give a necessary condition to be a monopole
class on some special connected sums.
