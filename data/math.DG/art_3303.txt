Eigenvalue Estimates For The Dirac Operator On Kaehler-Einstein
  Manifolds Of Even Complex Dimension
In K\"ahler-Einstein case of positive scalar curvature and even complex
dimension, an improved lower bound for the first eigenvalue of the Dirac
operator is given. It is shown by a general construction that there are
manifolds for which this new lower bound itself is the first eigenvalue.
