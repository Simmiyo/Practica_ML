Isometry groups of Alexandrov spaces
For an Alexandrov space (with curvature bounded below), we determine the
maximal dimension of its isometry group and show that the space is isometric to
a Riemannian manifold, provided the dimension of its isometry group is maximal.
We also determine a gap in the possible dimensions of the isometry groups and
show that if the Alexandrov space is symmetric, then it is isometric to a
Riemannian manifold.
