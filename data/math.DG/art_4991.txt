Equality in Laszlo Fejes Toth's triangle bound for hyperbolic surfaces
For k>6, we determine the minimal area of a compact hyperbolic surface, and
an oriented compact hyperbolic surface that can be tiled by embedded regular
triangles of angle 2\pi/k. Based on this, all the cases of equality in Laszlo
Fejes Toth's triangle bound for hyperbolic surfaces are described.
