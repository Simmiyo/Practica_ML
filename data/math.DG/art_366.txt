A new parabolic flow in Kaehler manifolds
In this paper, we introduce a new parabolic equation on K\"ahler manifolds.
The static point of this flow is related to the existence of a lower bound of
the Mabuchi energy. In this paper, we prove the flow always exists for all
times for any initial smooth data. Further more, if the initial metric has
non-negative bisectional curvature, we prove the flow converges to a static
metric eventually.
