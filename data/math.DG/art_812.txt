Totally skew embeddings of manifolds
We obtain bounds on the least dimension of an affine space that can contain
an $n$-dimensional submanifold without any pairs of parallel or intersecting
tangent lines at distinct points. This problem is closely related to the
generalized vector field problem, non-singular bilinear maps, and the immersion
problem for real projective spaces.
