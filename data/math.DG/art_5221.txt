Affine geometry of second order ODEs
We apply the Cartan equivalence method to the study of real analytic second
order ODEs under the local real analytic diffeomorphism of $\C^2$ which are
area-preserving. This enables us to give a characterization of the second order
ODEs which are equivalent to $y^{\prime\prime}=0$ under such transformations.
Moreover we associate to certain of these second order ODEs which satisfy an
invariant condition given by the vanishing of a relative differential
invariant, an affine normal Cartan connection on the first jet space whose
curvature contains all the area-preserving relative differential invariants.
