A remark on distributions and the de Rham theorem
We show that the de Rham theorem, interpreted as the isomorphism between
distributional de Rham cohomology and simplicial homology in the dual dimension
for a simplicial decomposition of a compact oriented manifold, is a
straightforward consequence of elementary properties of currents. The explicit
construction of this isomorphism extends to other cases, such as relative and
absolute cohomology spaces of manifolds with corners.
