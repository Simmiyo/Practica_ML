Weierstrass representation for timelike minimal surfaces in Minkowski
  3-space
Using techniques of integrable systems, we study a Weierstrass representation
formula for timelike surfaces with prescribed mean curvature in Minkowski
3-space. It is shown that timelike minimal surfaces are obtained by integrating
a pair of Lorentz holomorphic and Lorentz antiholomorphic null curves in
Minkowski 3-space. The relationship between timelike minimal surfaces and
bosonic Nambu-Goto string worldsheets in spacetime is also discussed in the
appendix.
