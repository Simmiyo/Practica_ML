A note on hyperbolic flows in sub-Riemannian Structures
The curvature and the reduced curvature are basic differential invariants of
the pair (Hamiltonian system, Lagrange distribution) on the symplectic
manifold. It is shown that the negativity of the reduced curvature implies the
hyperbolicity of any compact invariant set of the Hamiltonian flow restricted
to a prescribed energy level. We consider the Hamiltonian flows of the curve of
least action of natural mechanical systems in sub-Riemannian structures with
symmetries. We give sufficient conditions for the reduced flows (after
reduction of the first integrals induced from the symmetries) to be hyperbolic
and show new examples of Anosov flows.
