Some Notes on G_2 and Spin(7) Geometry
We collect together various facts about G_2 and Spin(7) geometry which are
likely well known but which do not seem to have appeared explicitly in the
literature before. These notes should be useful to graduate students and new
researchers in G_2 and Spin(7) geometry.
