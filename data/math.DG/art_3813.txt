Kähler Ricci flow on Fano manifolds with vanished Futaki invariants
In this paper, we establish several sufficient and necessary conditions for
the convergence of a K\"ahler-Ricci flow, on a K\"ahler manifold with positive
first Chern class, to a K\"ahler-Einstein metric (or a shrinking K\"ahler-Ricci
soliton).
