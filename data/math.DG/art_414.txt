Mean curvature 1 surfaces in hyperbolic 3-space with low total curvature
  II
In this work, complete constant mean curvature 1 (CMC-1) surfaces in
hyperbolic 3-space with total absolute curvature at most 4 pi are classified.
This classification suggests that the Cohn-Vossen inequality can be sharpened
for surfaces with odd numbers of ends, and a proof of this is given.
