Eigenvalue monotonicity for the Ricci-Hamilton flow, revised version
This is a revised version of our short note [arxiv.math.DG/0403065] where we
discuss the monotonicity of the eigen-values of the Laplacian operator to the
Ricci-Hamilton flow on a compact or a complete non-compact Riemannian manifold.
We show that the eigenvalue of the Lapacian operator on a compact domain
associated with the evolving Ricci flow is non-decreasing provided the scalar
curvature having a non-negative lower bound and Einstein tensor being not too
negative. This result will be useful in the study of blow-up models of the
Ricci-Hamilton flow. We remark that using our idea, D.Kokotov and D.Korotkin
[Normalized Ricci Flow on Riemann Surfaces and Determinant of Laplacian,
Letters in Mathematical Physics, 71(3)(2005)241-242] can give a simple proof of
the fact that the determinant of Laplace operator in a smooth metric over
compact Riemann surfaces of an arbitrary genus g monotonously grows under the
normalized Ricci flow. Together with results of Hamilton and B.Chow that under
the action of the normalized Ricci flow a smooth metric tends asymptotically to
the metric of constant curvature, this leads to a simple proof of the
Osgood-Phillips-Sarnak theorem stating that within the class of smooth metrics
with fixed conformal class and fixed volume the determinant of the Laplace
operator is maximal on the metric of constant curvature. One may consider
similar problems for other geometric flow and other elliptic operators, such as
Yamabe flow, or Kahler-Ricci flow.
