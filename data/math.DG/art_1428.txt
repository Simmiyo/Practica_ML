Aloff-Wallach Spaces: Volumes, Curvatures, Injectivity Radii
In this paper, we obtain two-sided bounds for the volumes of the
Aloff-Wallach spaces $W(p,q),$ compute maximal and minimal sectional curvature
for the spaces $W(n,n+1),$ and use this information to estimate the injectivity
radii: We derive an upper bound for the injectivity radii of $W(p,q)$ and a
lower bound for the injectivity radii of $W(n,n+1).$
