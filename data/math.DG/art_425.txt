An Index Theorem for Toeplitz Operators on Odd Dimensional Manifolds
  with Boundary
We establish an index theorem for Toeplitz operators on odd dimensional spin
manifolds with boundary. It may be thought of as an odd dimensional analogue of
the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem for Dirac operators on manifolds with
boundary. In particular, there occurs naturally an invariant of $\eta$ type
associated to $K^1$ representatives on even dimensional manifolds, which should
be of independent interests. For example, it gives an intrinsic interpretation
of the so called Wess-Zumino term in the WZW theory in physics.
