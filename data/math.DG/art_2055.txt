Local results for flows whose speed or height satisfies a bound of the
  form $\frac c t$
In this paper we prove local results for solutions to the Ricci flow (heat
flow) whose speed (height) is bounded by $\frac c t$ for some time interval $ t
\in (0,T)$. These results are contained in chapter 7 of the author's
habilitation thesis, University of Freiburg, Germany, 2006.
