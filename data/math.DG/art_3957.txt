The Generalized Stokes theorem for R-linear forms on Lie algebroids
The author presents the generalized Stokes theorem for R-linear forms on Lie
algebroids (which can be non-local). We apply the Stokes formula on forms to
prove that two homotopic homomorphisms of Lie algebroids implies the existence
of a chain operator joining their pullback operators.
