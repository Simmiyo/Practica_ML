Examples of algebraic Ricci solitons in the Pseudo-Riemannian case
This paper provides a study of algebraic Ricci solitons in the
pseudo-Riemannian case. In the Riemannian case, all nontrivial homogeneous
algebraic Ricci solitons are expanding algebraic Ricci solitons. In this paper,
we obtain a steady algebraic Ricci soliton and a shrinking algebraic Ricci
soliton in the Lorentzian setting.
