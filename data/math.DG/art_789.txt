The Casimir operator of a metric connection with skew-symmetric torsion
For any triple $(M^n, g, \nabla)$ consisting of a Riemannian manifold and a
metric connection with skew-symmetric torsion we introduce an elliptic, second
order operator $\Omega$ acting on spinor fields. In case of a reductive space
and its canonical connection our construction yields the Casimir operator of
the isometry group. Several non-homogeneous geometries (Sasakian, nearly
K\"ahler, cocalibrated $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures) admit unique connections with
skew-symmetric torsion. We study the corresponding Casimir operator and compare
its kernel with the space of $\nabla$-parallel spinors.
