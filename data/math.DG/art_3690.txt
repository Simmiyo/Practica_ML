Schur's theorem of antiholomorphic type for quasi-Kählerian manifolds
It is proved, that if a quasi-K\"ahler manifold $M$ of dimension greater or
equal to 6 is of pointwise constant antiholomorphic sectional curvature $\nu$,
then $\nu$, the scalar curvature and the $*$-scalar curvature of $M$ are
constants.
