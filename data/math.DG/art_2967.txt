Maslov index in semi-Riemannian submersions
We study focal points and Maslov index of a horizontal geodesic $\gamma:I\to
M$ in the total space of a semi-Riemannian submersion $\pi:M\to B$ by
determining an explicit relation with the corresponding objects along the
projected geodesic $\pi\circ\gamma:I\to B$ in the base space. We use this
result to calculate the focal Maslov index of a (spacelike) geodesic in a
stationary space-time which is orthogonal to a timelike Killing vector field.
