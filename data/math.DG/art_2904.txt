Deformations of hyperbolic convex polyhedra and 3-cone-manifolds
The Stoker problem, first formulated in 1968, consists in understanding to
what extent a convex polyhedron is determined by its dihedral angles. By means
of the double construction, this problem is intimately related to rigidity
issues for 3-dimensional cone-manifolds. In a former paper, two such rigidity
results were proven, implying that the infinitesimal version of the Stoker
conjecture is true in the hyperbolic and Euclidean cases. In this second
article, we prove that local rigidity holds and obtain that the space of convex
hyperbolic polyhedra with given combinatorial type is locally parameterized by
the set of dihedral angles, together with a similar statement for hyperbolic
3-cone-manifolds.
