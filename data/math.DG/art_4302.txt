Path space as manifold, manifold of maps, infinite dimensional manifold
Let $M$ be any $n$ dimensional smooth manifold and $PM$ be the space of all
smooth paths, then we showed that $PM$ is a smooth manifold modelled over a
complete normable space. We discussed many geometric structure on Path spaces
and its relation to ambient space.
