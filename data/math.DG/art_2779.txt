Geometric Realizations of Hermitian curvature models
We show that a Hermitian algebraic curvature model satisfies the Gray
identity if and only if it is geometrically realizable by a Hermitian manifold.
Furthermore, such a curvature model can in fact be realized by a Hermitian
manifold of constant scalar curvature and constant *-scalar curvature which
satisfies the Kaehler condition at the point in question.
