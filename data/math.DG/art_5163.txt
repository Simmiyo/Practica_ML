On Einstein square metrics
In this paper, we study an important class of Finsler metrics--square
metrics. We give two expressions of such metrics in terms of a Riemannian
metric and a 1-form. We show that Einstein square metrics can be classified up
to the classification of Einstein Riemannian metrics.
