Gerbes, Clifford modules and the index theorem
The use of bundle gerbes and bundle gerbe modules is considered as a
replacement for the usual theory of Clifford modules on manifolds that fail to
be spin. It is shown that both sides of the Atiyah-Singer index formula for
coupled Dirac operators can be given natural interpretations using this
language and that the resulting formula is still an identity.
