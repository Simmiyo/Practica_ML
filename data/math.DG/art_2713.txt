Duality between Hyperbolic and de Sitter Geometry
In this paper we describe trigonometry on the de Sitter surface. For that a
characterization of geodesics is given, leading to various types of triangles.
We define lengths and angles of these. Then, transferring the concept of polar
triangles from spherical geometry into the Minkowski space, we relate
hyperbolic with de Sitter triangles such that the proof of the hyperbolic law
of cosines for angles becomes much clearer and easier than it is traditionally.
Furthermore, polar triangles turn out to be a powerful tool for describing de
Sitter trigonometry.
