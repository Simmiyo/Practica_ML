A simple proof of the Gauss-Bonnet-Chern formula for Finsler manifolds
From the point of view of index theory, we give a simple proof of a
Gauss-Bonnet-Chern formula for all Finsler manifolds by the Cartan connection.
Based on this, we establish a Gauss-Bonnet-Chern formula for any
metric-compatible connection and also derive the Gauss-Bonnet-Chern formula of
Lackey.
