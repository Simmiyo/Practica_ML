Smoothing metrics on closed Riemannian manifolds through the Ricci flow
Under the assumption of the uniform local Sobolev inequality, it is proved
that Riemannian metrics with an absolute Ricci curvature bound and a small
Riemannian curvature integral bound can be smoothed to having a sectional
curvature bound. This partly extends previous a priori estimates of Ye Li (J.
