On the first eigenvalue of the Witten-Laplacian and the diameter of
  compact shrinking Ricci solitons
We prove a lower bound estimate for the first non-zero eigenvalue of the
Witten-Laplacian on compact Riemannian manifolds. As an application, we derive
a lower bound estimate for the diameter of compact gradient shrinking Ricci
solitons. Our results improve some previous estimates which were obtained by
the first author and Y. Sano in [12], and by B. Andrews and L. Ni in [1].
Moreover, we extend the diameter estimate to compact self-similar shrinkers of
mean curvature flow.
