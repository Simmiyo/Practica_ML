Nonorientable maximal surfaces in the Lorentz-Minkowski 3-space
The geometry and topology of complete nonorientable maximal surfaces with
lightlike singularities in the Lorentz-Minkowski 3-space are studied. Some
topological congruence formulae for surfaces of this kind are obtained. As a
consequence, some existence and uniqueness results for maximal Moebius strips
and maximal Klein bottles with one end are proved.
