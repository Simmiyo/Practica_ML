Ruled minimal surfaces in $\Bbb R^3$ with density $e^z$
We classify ruled minimal surfaces in $\Bbb R^3$ with density $e^z.$ It is
showed that there is no noncylindrical ruled minimal surface and there is a
family of cylindrical ruled minimal surfaces in $\Bbb R^3$ with density $e^z.$
It is also proved that all translation minimal surfaces are ruled.
