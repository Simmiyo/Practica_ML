A splitting theorem for Kahler manifolds whose Ricci tensors have
  constant eigenvalues
It is proved that a compact Kahler manifold whose Ricci tensor has two
distinct, constant, non-negative eigenvalues is locally the product of two
Kahler-Einstein manifolds. A stronger result is established for the case of
Kahler surfaces. Irreducible Kahler manifolds with two distinct, constant
eigenvalues of the Ricci tensor are shown to exist in various situations: there
are homogeneous examples of any complex dimension n > 1, if one eigenvalue is
negative and the other positive or zero, and of any complex dimension n > 2, if
the both eigenvalues are negative; there are non-homogeneous examples of
complex dimension 2, if one of the eigenvalues is zero. The problem of
existence of Kahler metrics whose Ricci tensor has two distinct, constant
eigenvalues is related to the celebrated (still open) Goldberg conjecture.
Consequently, the irreducible homogeneous examples with negative eigenvalues
give rise to complete, Einstein, strictly almost Kahler metrics of any even
real dimension greater than 4.
