On the Perelman's reduced entropy and Ricci flat manifolds with maximal
  volume growth
In this paper, we study the Ricci flat manifolds with maximal volume growth
using Perelman's reduced volume of Ricci flow. We show that if $(M^n,g)$ is an
noncompact complete Ricci flat manifold with maximal volume growth satisfying
$|Rm|(x)\to 0$ as $d(x)=d_g(x,p)\to \infty$, then $M^n$ has the quadratic
curvature decay. Some applications to this result are also presented.
