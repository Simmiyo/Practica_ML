Conformal changes of generalized complex structures
A conformal change of $TM\oplus T^*M$ is a morphism of the form
$(X,\alpha)\mapsto(X,e^\tau\alpha)$ $(X\in TM,\alpha\in T^*M,\tau\in
C^\infty(M))$. We characterize the generalized almost complex and almost
Hermitian structures that are locally conformal to integrable and to
generalized K\"ahler structures, respectively, and give examples of such
structures.
