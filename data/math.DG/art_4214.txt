Sweeping out sectional curvature
We observe that the maximal open set of constant curvature k in a Riemannian
manifold with curvature bounded below or above by k has a convexity type
property, which we call "two-convexity". This statement is used to prove a
number of rigidity statements in comparison geometry.
