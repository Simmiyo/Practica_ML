On the weighted forward reduced Entropy of Ricci flow
In this paper, we first introduce the weighted forward reduced volume of
Ricci flow. The weighted forward reduced volume, which related to expanders of
Ricci flow, is well-defined on noncompact manifolds and monotone non-increasing
under Ricci flow. Moreover, we show that, just the same as the Perelman's
reduced volume, the weighted reduced volume entropy has the value
$(4\pi)^{\frac{n}{2}}$ if and only if the Ricci flow is the trivial flow on
flat Euclidean space.
