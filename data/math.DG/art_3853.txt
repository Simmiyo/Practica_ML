Minimal Lagrangian submanifolds in indefinite complex space
Consider the complex linear space C^n endowed with the canonical
pseudo-Hermitian form of signature (2p,2(n-p)). This yields both a
pseudo-Riemannian and a symplectic structure on C^n. We prove that those
submanifolds which are both Lagrangian and minimal with respect to these
structures minimize the volume in their Lagrangian homology class. We also
describe several families of minimal Lagrangian submanifolds. In particular, we
characterize the minimal Lagrangian surfaces in C^2 endowed with its natural
neutral metric and the equivariant minimal Lagrangian submanifolds of C^n with
arbitrary signature.
