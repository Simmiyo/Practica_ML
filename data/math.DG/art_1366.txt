Singular Riemannian Foliations on Nonpositively Curved Manifolds
We prove the nonexistence of a proper singular Riemannian foliation admitting
section in compact manifolds of nonpositive curvature. Then we give a global
description of proper singular Riemannian foliations admitting sections on
Hadamard manifolds. In addition by using the theory of taut immersions we
provide a short proof of this result in the special case of a polar action.
