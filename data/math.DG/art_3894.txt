Double Conformal Invariants and the Wodzicki Residue
For compact real manifolds, a new double conformal invariant is constructed
using the Wodzicki residue and the $d$ operator in the framework of Connes. In
the flat case, we compute this double conformal invariant, and in some special
cases, we also compute this double conformal invariants. For complex manifolds,
a new double conformal invariant is constructed using the Wodzicki residue and
the $\bar{\partial}$ operator in the same way, and this double conformal
invariant is computed in the flat case.
