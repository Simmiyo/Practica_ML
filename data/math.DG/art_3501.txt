An Optimal Differentiable Sphere Theorem for Complete Manifolds
A new differentiable sphere theorem is obtained from the view of submanifold
geometry. An important scalar is defined by the scalar curvature and the mean
curvature of an oriented complete submanifold $M^n$ in a space form
$F^{n+p}(c)$ with $c\ge0$. Making use of the Hamilton-Brendle-Schoen
convergence result for Ricci flow and the Lawson-Simons-Xin formula for the
nonexistence of stable currents, we prove that if the infimum of this scalar is
positive, then $M$ is diffeomorphic to $S^n$. We then introduce an intrinsic
invariant $I(M)$ for oriented complete Riemannian $n$-manifold $M$ via the
scalar, and prove that if $I(M)>0$, then $M$ is diffeomorphic to $S^n$. It
should be emphasized that our differentiable sphere theorem is optimal for
arbitrary $n(\ge2)$.
