Infinitesimal index: cohomology computations
In this note several computations of equivariant cohomology groups are
performed. For the compactly supported equivariant cohomology, the notion of
infinitesimal index developed in arXiv:1003.3525, allows to describe these
groups in terms of certain spaces of distributions arising in the theory of
splines.
  The new version contains a large number of improvements.
