Harmonicity of sections of sphere bundles
We consider the energy functional on the space of sections of a sphere bundle
over a Riemannian manifold (M, <,>) equipped with the Sasaki metric and we
discuss the characterising condition for critical points. Likewise, we provide
a useful method for computing the tension field in some particular situations.
Such a method is shown to be adequate for many tensor fields defined on
manifolds M equipped with a G-structure compatible with <,>. This leads to the
construction of a lot of new examples of differential forms which are harmonic
sections or determine a harmonic map from (M,<,>) into its sphere bundle.
