Handle Addition for doubly-periodic Scherk Surfaces
We prove the existence of a family of embedded doubly periodic minimal
surfaces of (quotient) genus $g$ with orthogonal ends that generalizes the
classical doubly periodic surface of Scherk and the genus-one Scherk surface of
Karcher. The proof of the family of immersed surfaces is by induction on genus,
while the proof of embeddedness is by the conjugate Plateau method.
