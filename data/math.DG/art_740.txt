C^0-topology in Morse theory
Let $f$ be a Morse function on a closed manifold $M$, and $v$ be a Riemannian
gradient of $f$ satisfying the transversality condition. The classical
construction (due to Morse, Smale, Thom, Witten), based on the counting of flow
lines joining critical points of the function $f$ associates to these data the
Morse complex $M_*(f,v)$. In the present paper we introduce a new class of
vector fields ($f$-gradients) associated to a Morse function $f$. This class is
wider than the class of Riemannian gradients and provides a natural framework
for the study of the Morse complex. Our construction of the Morse complex does
not use the counting of the flow lines, but rather the fundamental classes of
the stable manifolds, and this allows to replace the transversality condition
required in the classical setting by a weaker condition on the $f$-gradient
(almost transversality condition) which is $C^0$-stable. We prove then that the
Morse complex is stable with respect to $C^0$-small perturbations of the
$f$-gradient, and study the functorial properties of the Morse complex. The
last two sections of the paper are devoted to the properties of functoriality
and $C^0$-stability for the Novikov complex $N_*(f,v)$ where $f$ is a
circle-valued Morse map and $v$ is an almost transverse $f$-gradient.
