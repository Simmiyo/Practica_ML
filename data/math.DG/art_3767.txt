The sharp estimates for the first eigenvalue of Paneitz operator on
  4-dimensional submanifolds
In this note, we obtain the sharp estimates for the first eigenvalue of
Paneitz operator for $4$-dimensional compact submanifolds in Euclidean space.
Since unit spheres and projective spaces can be canonically imbedded into
Euclidean space, the corresponding estimates for the first eigenvalue are also
obtained.
