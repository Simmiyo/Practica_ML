Polygons with Parallel Opposite Sides
In this paper we consider planar polygons with parallel opposite sides. This
type of polygons can be regarded as discretizations of closed convex planar
curves by taking tangent lines at samples with pairwise parallel tangents. For
this class of polygons, we define discrete versions of the area evolute,
central symmetry set, equidistants and area parallels and show that they behave
quite similarly to their smooth counterparts.
