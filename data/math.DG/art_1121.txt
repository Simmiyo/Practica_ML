Lower bounds for Morse index of constant mean curvature tori
We give three lower bounds for the Morse index of a constant mean curvature
torus in Euclidean 3-space in terms of its spectral genus g. The first two
lower bounds grow linearly in g and are stronger for smaller values of g, while
the third grows quadratically in g but is weaker for smaller values of g.
