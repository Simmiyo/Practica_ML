Filtrations, factorizations and explicit formulae for harmonic maps
We use filtrations of the Grassmannian model to produce explicit algebraic
formulae for all harmonic maps of finite uniton number from a Riemann surface,
and so all harmonic maps from the 2-sphere, to the unitary group for a general
class of factorizations by unitons. We show how these specialize to give
explicit formulae for such harmonic maps to each of the classical compact Lie
groups and their inner symmetric spaces - the nonlinear sigma-model of particle
physics. Our methods also give an explicit Iwasawa decomposition of the
algebraic loop group.
