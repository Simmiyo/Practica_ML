Limit of quasilocal mass integrals in asymptotically hyperbolic
  manifolds
In this paper, we will show that the limit of some quasilocal mass integrals
of the coordinate spheres in an asymptotically hyperbolic (AH) manifold is the
mass integral of the AH manifold. This is the analogue of the well known result
that the limit of the Brown-York mass of coordinate spheres is the ADM mass in
an asymptotically flat manifold.
