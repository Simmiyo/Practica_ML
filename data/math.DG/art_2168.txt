Discrete Koenigs nets and discrete isothermic surfaces
We discuss discretization of Koenigs nets (conjugate nets with equal Laplace
invariants) and of isothermic surfaces. Our discretization is based on the
notion of dual quadrilaterals: two planar quadrilaterals are called dual, if
their corresponding sides are parallel, and their non-corresponding diagonals
are parallel. Discrete Koenigs nets are defined as nets with planar
quadrilaterals admitting dual nets. Several novel geometric properties of
discrete Koenigs nets are found; in particular, two-dimensional discrete
Koenigs nets can be characterized by co-planarity of the intersection points of
diagonals of elementary quadrilaterals adjacent to any vertex; this
characterization is invariant with respect to projective transformations.
Discrete isothermic nets are defined as circular Koenigs nets. This is a new
geometric characterization of discrete isothermic surfaces introduced
previously as circular nets with factorized cross-ratios.
