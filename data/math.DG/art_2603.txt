Complete Constant Mean Curvature surfaces and Bernstein type Theorems in
  $\mathbb{M}^2\times \mathbb{R}$
In this paper we study constant mean curvature surfaces $\Sigma$ in a product
space, $\mathbb{M}^2\times \mathbb{R}$, where $\mathbb{M}^2$ is a complete
Riemannian manifold. We assume the angle function $\nu = \meta{N}{\partial_t}$
does not change sign on $\Sigma$. We classify these surfaces according to the
infimum $c(\Sigma)$ of the Gaussian curvature of the projection of $\Sigma$.
  When $H \neq 0$ and $c(\Sigma)\geq 0$, then $\Sigma $ is a cylinder over a
complete curve with curvature 2H. If H=0 and $c(\Sigma) \geq 0$, then $\Sigma$
must be a vertical plane or $\Sigma$ is a slice $\mathbb{M}^2 \times {t}$, or
$\mathbb{M}^2 \equiv \mathbb{R}^2$ with the flat metric and $\Sigma$ is a
tilted plane (after possibly passing to a covering space).
  When $c(\Sigma)<0$ and $H>\sqrt{-c(\Sigma)} /2$, then $\Sigma$ is a vertical
cylinder over a complete curve of $\mathbb{M}^2$ of constant geodesic curvature
$2H$. This result is optimal.
  We also prove a non-existence result concerning complete multi-graphs in
$\mathbb{M}^2\times \mathbb{R}$, when $c(\mathbb{M}^2)<0$.
