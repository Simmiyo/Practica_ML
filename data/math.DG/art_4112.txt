Tensor calculus and deformation theory on on a local Lie group
Historically tensor calculus emerged in an attempt to formalize Rie- mann's
ideas. We show that tensor calculus can be based also on Lie's idea of a
transformation group and this approach leads quite naturally to the concept of
deformation of a transformation group and the Kodaira- Spencer map.
