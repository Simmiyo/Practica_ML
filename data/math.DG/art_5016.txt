Asymptotics of the Yang-Mills Flow for Holomorphic Vector Bundles Over
  Kähler Manifolds: The Canonical Structure of the Limit
In the following article we study the limiting properties of the Yang-Mills
flow associated to a holomorphic vector bundle E over an arbitrary compact
K\"ahler manifold (X,{\omega}). In particular we show that the flow is
determined at infinity by the holomorphic structure of E. Namely, if we fix an
integrable unitary reference connection A_0 defining the holomorphic structure,
then the Yang-Mills flow with initial condition A_0, converges (away from an
appropriately defined singular set) in the sense of the Uhlenbeck compactness
theorem to a holomorphic vector bundle E_{\infty}, which is isomorphic to the
associated graded object of the Harder-Narasimhan-Seshadri filtration of
(E,A_0). Moreover, E_{\infty} extends as a reflexive sheaf over the singular
set as the double dual of the associated graded object. This is an extension of
previous work in the cases of 1 and 2 complex dimensions and proves the general
case of a conjecture of Bando and Siu.
