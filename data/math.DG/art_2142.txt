On some asymptotically flat manifolds with non maximal volume growth
Asymptotically flat manifolds with Euclidean volume growth are known to be
ALE. In this paper, we consider a class of asymptotically flat manifolds with
slower volume growth and prove that their asymptotic geometry is that of a
fibration over an ALE manifold. In particular, we show that gravitational
instantons with cubic volume growth are ALF.
