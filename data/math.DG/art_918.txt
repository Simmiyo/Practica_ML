Hyperbolic Twistor Spaces
In contrast to the classical twistor spaces whose fibres are 2-spheres, we
introduce twistor spaces over manifolds with almost quaternionic structures of
the second kind in the sense of P. Libermann whose fibres are hyperbolic
planes. We discuss two natural almost complex structures on such a twistor
space and their holomorphic functions.
