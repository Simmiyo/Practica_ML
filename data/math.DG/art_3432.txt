Some calibrated surfaces in manifolds with density
Hyperplanes, hyperspheres and hypercylinders in $\Bbb R^n$ with suitable
densities are proved to be weighted minimizing by a calibration argument. Also
calibration method is used to prove a weighted minimal hypersurface is weighted
area-minimizing locally.
