Stochastic Properties of the Laplacian on Riemannian Submersions
Based on ideas of Pigolla and Setti \cite{PS} we prove that immersed
submanifolds with bounded mean curvature of Cartan-Hadamard manifolds are
Feller. We also consider Riemannian submersions $\pi \colon M \to N$ with
compact minimal fibers, and based on various criteria for parabolicity and
stochastic completeness, see \cite{Grygor'yan}, we prove that $M$ is Feller,
parabolic or stochastically complete if and only if the base $N$ is Feller,
parabolic or stochastically complete respectively.
