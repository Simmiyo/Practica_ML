Invariance of regularity conditions under definable, locally Lipschitz,
  weakly bi-Lipschitz mappings
In this paper we describe the notion of a weak lipschitzianity of a mapping
on a $C^{q}$ stratification. We also distinguish a class of regularity
conditions that are in some sense invariant under definable, locally Lipschitz
and weakly bi-Lipschitz homeomorphisms. This class includes the Whitney (B)
condition and the Verdier condition.
