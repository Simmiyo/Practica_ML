Einstein solvmanifolds attached to two-step nilradicals
A Riemannian Einstein solvmanifold (possibly, any noncompact homogeneous
Einstein space) is almost completely determined by the nilradical of its Lie
algebra. A nilpotent Lie algebra, which can serve as the nilradical of an
Einstein metric solvable Lie algebra, is called an Einstein nilradical. Despite
a substantial progress towards the understanding of Einstein nilradicals, there
is still a lack of classification results even for some well-studied classes of
nilpotent Lie algebras, such as the two-step ones. In this paper, we give a
classification of two-step nilpotent Einstein nilradicals in one of the rare
cases when the complete set of affine invariants is known: for the two-step
nilpotent Lie algebras with the two-dimensional center. Informally speaking, we
prove that such a Lie algebra is an Einstein nilradical, if it is defined by a
matrix pencil having no nilpotent blocks in the canonical form and no
elementary divisors of a very high multiplicity. We also discuss the connection
between the property of a two-step nilpotent Lie algebra and its dual to be an
Einstein nilradical.
