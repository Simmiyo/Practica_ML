3-forms and almost complex structures on 6-dimensional manifolds
This article deals with 3-forms on 6-dimensional manifodls, the first
dimension where the classification of 3-forms is not trivial. There are three
classes of multisymplectic 3-forms there. We study the class which is closely
related to almost complex structures.
