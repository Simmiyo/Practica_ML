A rigidity theorem in Alexandrov spaces with lower curvature bound
Distance functions of metric spaces with lower curvature bound, by
definition, enjoy various metric inequalities; triangle comparison, quadruple
comparison and the inequality of Lang-Schroeder-Sturm. The purpose of this
paper is to study the extremal cases of these inequalities and to prove
rigidity results. The spaces which we shall deal with here are Alexandrov
spaces which possibly have infinite dimension and are not supposed to be
locally compact.
