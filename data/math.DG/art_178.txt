Collapsing and the Differential Form Laplacian : The Case of a Smooth
  Limit Space
We analyze the limit of the p-form Laplacian under a collapse, with bounded
sectional curvature and bounded diameter, to a smooth limit space. As an
application, we characterize when the p-form Laplacian has small positive
eigenvalues in a collapsing sequence.
