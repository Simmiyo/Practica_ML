Higher K-energy functionals and higher Futaki invariants
This note discusses the higher K-energy functionals which were defined by
Bando and Mabuchi, and integrate higher Futaki invariants. Two new formulas for
the higher K-energy functionals are given, and the second K-energy is shown to
be related to Donaldson's Lagrangian applied to metrics on the tangent bundle.
