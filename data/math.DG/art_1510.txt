Twistor spinors with zero on Lorentzian 5-space
We present in this paper a $C^1$-metric on an open neighbourhood of the
origin in $\RR^{5}$. The metric is of Lorentzian signature $(1,4)$ and admits a
solution to the twistor equation for spinors with a unique isolated zero at the
origin. The metric is not conformally flat in any neighbourhood of the origin.
The construction is based on the Eguchi-Hanson metric with parallel spinors on
Riemannian 4-space.
