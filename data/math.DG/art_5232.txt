A note on quasi umbilical hypersurface of a Sasakian manifold with
  $(φ, g, u, v, λ)-$ structure
In this paper we have studied the properties of Quasi umbilical hypersurface
$M$ of a Sasakian manifold $\tilde M$ with $(\phi, g, u, v, \lambda)-$structure
and established the relation for $M$ to be cylindrical.
