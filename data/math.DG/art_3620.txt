Support Theorems for Horocycles on Hyperbolic Spaces
A support theorem for the horocycle Radon transform f \to \hat{f} is a
property of the form \hat{f} of compact support \rightarrow f of compact
support. Here we prove a variation of this result where support (\hat{f}) is
outside a fixed horocycle in hyperbolic space.
