Isospectral Alexandrov Spaces
We construct the first non-trivial examples of compact non-isometric
Alexandrov spaces which are isospectral with respect to the Laplacian and not
isometric to Riemannian orbifolds. This construction generalizes independent
earlier results by the authors based on Schueth's version of the torus method.
