Orbits of Lie Group Actions are Weakly Embedded
In this note we prove that whenever a Lie group $G$ acts on a manifold $X$,
then the orbit $Gx$ through any point $x$ of $X$ is a weakly embedded
submanifold of $X$. The investigation of this problem was inspired by an
application to Cat astrophe Theory.
