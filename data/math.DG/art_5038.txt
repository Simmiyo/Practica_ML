Generalized Finsler structures on closed 3-manifolds
An (I,J,K)-generalized Finsler structure on a 3-manifold is a generalization
of a Finslerian structure, introduced in order to separate and clarify the
local and global aspects in Finsler geometry making use of the Cartan's method
of exterior differential systems. In this paper, we show that there is a close
relation between (I,J,1)-generalized Finsler structures and a class of contact
circles, namely the so-called Cartan structures. This correspondence allows us
to determine the topology of 3-manifolds that admit (I, J, 1)-generalized
Finsler structures and to single out classes of (I, J, 1)-generalized Finsler
structures induced by standard Cartan structures.
