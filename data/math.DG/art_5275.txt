A note on static spaces and related problems
We solve the classifying problem raised by Fischer and Marsden for Bach flat
static spaces. We also prove the conjecture about critical point equations
proposed by Besse for Bach flat manifolds. Particularly in dimension 3, we
derive an integral identity that allows us to obtain conformal flatness from
the vanish of the full divergence of the Cotton tensor for static metrics and
metrics satisfying the critical point equation.
