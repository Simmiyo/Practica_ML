Deformations of Compact Coassociative 4-folds with Boundary
Coassociative 4-folds are a particular class of 4-dimensional submanifolds
which are defined in a 7-dimensional manifold M with a G_2 structure given by a
`positive' differential 3-form, sometimes called G_2-form. Assuming that a
G_2-form on M is closed, we study deformations of a compact coassociative
submanifold N with boundary contained in fixed, codimension 1 submanifold S of
M with a compatible Hermitian symplectic structure. We show that `small'
coassociative deformations of N with special Lagrangian boundary in S are
unobstructed and form a smooth moduli space of finite dimension not greater
than the first Betti number of the boundary of N. It is also shown that N is
`stable' under small deformations of the closed G_2-form on the ambient
7-manifold M. The results can be compared to those for special Lagrangian
submanifolds of Calabi--Yau manifolds proved by A.Butscher in math.DG/0110052.
