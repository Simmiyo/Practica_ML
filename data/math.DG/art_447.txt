An Introduction to Pull-backs of Bundles and Homotopy Invariance
We define the pull-back of a smooth principal fibre bundle, and show that it
has a natural principal fibre bundle structure. Next, we analyse the
relationship between pull-backs by homotopy equivalent maps. The main result of
this article is to show that for a principal fibre bundle over a paracompact
manifold, there is a principal fibre bundle isomorphism between pull-backs
obtained from homotopic maps. This enables simple proofs of several results on
the structure of principal fibre bundles. No new results are obtained---this is
simply an accessible presentation of an important idea.
