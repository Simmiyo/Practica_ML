A Morse complex for Lorentzian geodesics
We prove the Morse relations for the set of all geodesics connecting two
non-conjugate points on a class of globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds. We
overcome the difficulties coming from the fact that the Morse index of every
geodesic is infinite, and from the lack of the Palais-Smale condition, by using
the Morse complex approach.
