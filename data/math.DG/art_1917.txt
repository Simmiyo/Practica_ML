On a conjecture of Schroeder and Strake
We prove some rigidity results for compact manifolds with boundary. In
particular for a compact Riemannian manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature
and simply connected mean convex boundary, it is shown that if the sectional
curvature vanishes on the boundary, then the metric must be flat.
