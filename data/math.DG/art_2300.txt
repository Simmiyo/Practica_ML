Invariants and submanifolds in almost complex geometry
In this paper we describe the algebra of differential invariants for
GL(n,C)-structures. This leads to classification of almost complex structures
of general positions. The invariants are applied to the existence problem of
higher-dimensional pseudoholomorphic submanifolds.
