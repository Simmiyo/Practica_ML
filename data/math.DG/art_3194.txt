Hypersurfaces of Lorentzian para-Sasakian manifolds
In this paper, we study the invariant and noninvariant hypersurfaces of
(1,1,1) almost contact manifolds, Lorentzian almost paracontact manifolds and
Lorentzian para-Sasakian manifolds, respectively. We show that a noninvariant
hypersurface of an (1,1,1) almost contact manifold admits an almost product
structure. We investigate hypersurfaces of affinely cosymplectic and normal
(1,1,1) almost contact manifolds. It is proved that a noninvariant hypersurface
of a Lorentzian almost paracontact manifold is an almost product metric
manifold. Some necessary and sufficient conditions have been given for a
noninvariant hypersurface of a Lorentzian para-Sasakian manifold to be locally
product manifold. We establish a Lorentzian para-Sasakian structure for an
invariant hypersurface of a Lorentzian para-Sasakian manifold. Finally we give
some examples for invariant and noninvariant hypersurfaces of a Lorentzian
para-Sasakian manifold.
