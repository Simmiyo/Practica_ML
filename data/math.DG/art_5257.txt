A loop group method for minimal surfaces in the three-dimensional
  Heisenberg group
We characterize constant mean curvature surfaces in the three-dimensional
Heisenberg group by a family of flat connections on the trivial bundle $\D
\times \GL$ over a simply connected domain $\mathbb{D}$ in the complex plane.
In particular for minimal surfaces, we give an immersion formula, the so-called
Sym-formula, and a generalized Weierstrass type representation via the loop
group method.
