Spectral flow and iteration of closed semi-Riemannian geodesics
We introduce the notion of spectral flow along a periodic semi-Riemannian
geodesic, as a suitable substitute of the Morse index in the Riemannian case.
We study the growth of the spectral flow along a closed geodesic under
iteration, determining its asymptotic behavior.
