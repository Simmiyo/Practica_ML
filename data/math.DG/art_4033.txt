Scattering rigidity with trapped geodesics
We prove that the flat product metric on $D^n\times S^1$ is scattering rigid
where $D^n$ is the unit ball in $\R^n$ and $n\geq 2$. The scattering data
(loosely speaking) of a Riemannian manifold with boundary is map $S:U^+\partial
M\to U^-\partial M$ from unit vectors $V$ at the boundary that point inward to
unit vectors at the boundary that point outwards. The map (where defined) takes
$V$ to $\gamma'_V(T_0)$ where $\gamma_V$ is the unit speed geodesic determined
by $V$ and $T_0$ is the first positive value of $t$ (when it exists) such that
$\gamma_V(t)$ again lies in the boundary. We show that any other Riemannian
manifold $(M,\partial M,g)$ with boundary $\partial M$ isometric to
$\partial(D^n\times S^1)$ and with the same scattering data must be isometric
to $D^n\times S^1$. This is the first scattering rigidity result for a manifold
that has a trapped geodesic. The main issue is to show that the unit vectors
tangent to trapped geodesics in $(M,\partial M,g)$ have measure 0 in the unit
tangent bundle.
