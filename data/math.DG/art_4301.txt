Extremal Sasakian Geometry on $T^2\times S^3$ and Related Manifolds
We prove the existence of extremal Sasakian structures occurring on a
countably infinite number of distinct contact structures on $T^2\times S^3$ and
certain related manifolds. These structures occur in bouquets and exhaust the
Sasaki cones in all except one case in which there are no extremal metrics.
