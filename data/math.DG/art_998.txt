The Ambient Obstruction Tensor and Q-Curvature
It is shown that the variational derivative of the integral of Branson's
Q-curvature is the ambient obstruction tensor of Fefferman-Graham. A
classification of irreducible conformally invariant tensors modulo quadratic
and higher degree terms in curvature is established.
