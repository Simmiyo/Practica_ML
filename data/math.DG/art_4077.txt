Geodesic orbit manifolds and Killing fields of constant length
The goal of this paper is to clarify connections between Killing fields of
constant length on a Rimannian geodesic orbit manifold $(M,g)$ and the
structure of its full isometry group. The Lie algebra of the full isometry
group of $(M,g)$ is identified with the Lie algebra of Killing fields
$\mathfrak{g}$ on $(M,g)$. We prove the following result: If $\mathfrak{a}$ is
an abelian ideal of $\mathfrak{g}$, then every Killing field $X\in
\mathfrak{a}$ has constant length. On the ground of this assertion we give a
new proof of one result of C. Gordon: Every Riemannian geodesic orbit manifold
of nonpositive Ricci curvature is a symmetric space.
