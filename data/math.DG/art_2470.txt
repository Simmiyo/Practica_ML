Compact anti-self-dual orbifolds with torus actions
We give a classification of toric anti-self-dual conformal structures on
compact 4-orbifolds with positive Euler characteristic. Our proof is twistor
theoretic: the interaction between the complex torus orbits in the twistor
space and the twistor lines induces meromorphic data, which we use to recover
the conformal structure. A compact anti-self-dual orbifold can also be
constructed by adding a point at infinity to an asymptotically locally
Euclidean (ALE) scalar-flat K\"ahler orbifold. We use this observation to
classify ALE scalar-flat K\"ahler 4-orbifolds whose isometry group contain a
2-torus.
