Almost quarter-pinched Kähler metrics and Chern numbers
We prove that compact K\"ahler manifolds whose sectional curvatures are close
to 1/4-pinched have ratios of Chern numbers close to the corresponding ratios
of a complex hyperbolic space form. We deduce that the Mostow-Siu surfaces (and
their three-dimensional analogues constructed by the first author) do not admit
K\"ahler metrics with pinching close to 1/4.
