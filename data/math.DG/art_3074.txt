Ricci identities of the Liouville d-vector fields z^2 and z^2
It is the purpose of the present paper to outline an introduction in theory
of embeddings in the manifold Osc^{2}M. First, we recall the notion of
2-osculator bundle. The second section is dedicated to the notion of
submanifold in the total space of the 2-osculator bundle, the manifold
Osc^{2}M. A moving frame is constructed. The induced N-linear connections and
the relative covariant derivatives are discussed in third and fourth sections.
The Ricci identities of the Liouville d-vector fields are present in the last
section.
