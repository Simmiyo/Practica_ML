CR Invariant powers of the sub-Laplacian
CR invariant differential operators on densities with leading part a power of
the sub-Laplacian are derived. One family of such operators is constructed from
the ``conformally invariant powers of the Laplacian'' via the Fefferman metric;
the powers which arise for these operators are bounded in terms of the
dimension. A second family is derived from a CR tractor calculus which is
developed here; this family includes operators for every positive power of the
sub-Laplacian. This result together with work of Cap, Slovak and Soucek imply
in three dimensions the existence of a curved analogue of each such operator in
flat space.
