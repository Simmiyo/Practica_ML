The Automorphism Group of a Banach Principal Bundle with {1}-structure
A {1}-structure on a Banach manifold M (with model space E) is an E-valued
1-form on M that induces on each tangent space an isomorphism onto E. Given a
Banach principal bundle P with connected base space and a {1}-structure on P,
we show that its automorphism group can be turned into a Banach-Lie group
acting smoothly on P provided the Lie algebra of infinitesimal automorphisms
consists of complete vector fields. As a consequence we show that the
automorphism group of a connected geodesically complete affine Banach manifold
M can be turned into a Banach-Lie group acting smoothly on M.
