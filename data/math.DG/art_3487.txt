Convergence of fundamental solutions of linear parabolic equations under
  Cheeger-Gromov convergence
In this note we show the convergence of the fundamental solutions of the
parabolic equations assuming the Cheeger-Gromov convergence of the underlying
manifolds and the uniform $L^1$-bound of the solutions. We also prove a local
integral estimate of fundamental solutions.
