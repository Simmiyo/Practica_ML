Polynomial Translation Weingarten Surfaces in 3-dimensional Euclidean
  space
In this paper we will classify those translation surfaces in E3 involving
polynomials which are Weingarten surfaces. We analyze Weingarten translation
surfaces satisfying 2aH + bK = 0. We study also other types of translation
surfaces, involving power functions, for which the second Gaussian curvature
vanishes.
