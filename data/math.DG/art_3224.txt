Finsler geodesics in the presence of a convex function and their
  applications
We obtain a result about the existence of only a finite number of geodesics
between two fixed non-conjugate points in a Finsler manifold endowed with a
convex function. We apply it to Randers and Zermelo metrics. As a by-product,
we also get a result about the finiteness of the number of lightlike and
timelike geodesics connecting an event to a line in a standard stationary
spacetime.
