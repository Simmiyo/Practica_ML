A much larger class of Frolicher spaces than that of convenient vector
  spaces may embed into the Cahier topos
It is well known that the category of Frolicher spaces and smooth mappings is
Cartesian closed. The principal objective in this paper is to show that the
full subcategory of Frolicher spaces that believe in fantasy that every Weil
functor is really an exponentiation by the corresponding infinitesimal object
is also Cartesian closed. Under the assumption that a conjecture holds, it is
shown that these Frolicher spaces embed into the Cahier topos with the
Cartesian closed structure being preserved.
