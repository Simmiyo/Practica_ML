Lower diameter bounds for compact shrinking Ricci solitons
It is shown that the diameter of a compact shrinking Ricci soliton has a
universal lower bound. This is proved by extending universal estimates for the
first non-zero eigenvalue of Laplacian on compact Riemannian manifolds with
lower Ricci curvature bound to a twisted Laplacian on compact shrinking Ricci
solitons.
