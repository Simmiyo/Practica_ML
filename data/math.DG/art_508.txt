Compatibility betwenn pseudo-riemannian structure and Poisson structure
We will introduce two notions of compatibility bettwen pseudo-Riemannian
metric and Poisson structure using the notion of contravariant connection
introduced by Fernandes R. L., we will study some proprities of manifold
endowed with such compatible structures an we will give some examples.
