Translating graphs by mean curvature flow
The aim of this work is studying translating graphs by mean curvature flow in
$\Real^3$. We prove non-existence of complete translating graphs over bounded
domains in $\Real^2$. Furthermore, we show that there are only three types of
complete translating graphs in $\Real^3$; entire graphs, graphs between two
vertical planes, and graphs in one side of a plane. In the last two types,
graphs are asymptotic to planes next to their boundaries. We also prove
stability of translating graphs and then we obtain a pointwise curvature bound
for translating graphs in $\Real^3$.
