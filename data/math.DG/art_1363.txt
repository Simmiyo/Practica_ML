Geometric structures of vectorial type
We study geometric structures of $\mathcal{W}_4$-type in the sense of A. Gray
on a Riemannian manifold. If the structure group $\mathrm{G} \subset \SO(n)$
preserves a spinor or a non-degenerate differential form, its intrinsic torsion
$\Gamma$ is a closed 1-form (Proposition \ref{dGamma} and Theorem
\ref{Fixspinor}). Using a $\mathrm{G}$-invariant spinor we prove a splitting
theorem (Proposition \ref{splitting}). The latter result generalizes and
unifies a recent result obtained in \cite{Ivanov&Co}, where this splitting has
been proved in dimensions $n=7,8$ only. Finally we investigate geometric
structures of vectorial type and admitting a characteristic connection
$\nabla^{\mathrm{c}}$. An interesting class of geometric structures
generalizing Hopf structures are those with a $\nabla^{\mathrm{c}}$-parallel
intrinsic torsion $\Gamma$. In this case, $\Gamma$ induces a Killing vector
field (Proposition \ref{Killing}) and for some special structure groups it is
even parallel.
