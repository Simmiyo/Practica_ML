On the cohomology algebra of some classes of geometrically formal
  manifolds
We investigate harmonic forms of geometrically formal metrics, which are
defined as those having the exterior product of any two harmonic forms still
harmonic. We prove that a formal Sasakian metric can exist only on a real
cohomology sphere and that holomorphic forms of a formal K\"ahler metric are
parallel w.r.t. the Levi-Civita connection. In the general Riemannian case a
formal metric with maximal second Betti number is shown to be flat. Finally we
prove that a six-dimensional manifold with $b_1 \neq 1, b_2 \geqslant 2$ and
not having the cohomology algebra of $\mathbb{T}^3 \times S^3$ carries a
symplectic structure as soon as it admits a formal metric.
