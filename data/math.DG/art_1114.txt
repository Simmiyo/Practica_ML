Legendrian graphs generated by Tangential Families
We construct a Legendrian version of Envelope theory. A tangential family is
a 1-parameter family of rays emanating tangentially from a smooth plane curve.
The Legendrian graph of the family is the union of the Legendrian lifts of the
family curves in the projectivized cotangent bundle $PT^*\R^2$. We study the
singularities of Legendrian graphs and their stability under small tangential
deformations. We also find normal forms of their projections into the plane.
This allows to interprete the beaks perestroika as the apparent contour of a
deformation of the Double Whitney Umbrella singularity $A_1^\pm$.
