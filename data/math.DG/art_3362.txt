Admissible Mannheim Curves in Pseudo-Galilean Space $G_3^1$
In this paper, first and second type admissible Mannheim partner curves are
defined in pseudo-Galilean space $G_3^1$. Moreover, it is proved that the
distance between the reciprocal points of both of first and second type
admissible Mannheim curves and the torsions of these curves are constant.
Furthermore, the relations for curvatures and torsions of these curves and
Schell Theorem are obtained. Finally, a result about these curves being general
helix is given.
