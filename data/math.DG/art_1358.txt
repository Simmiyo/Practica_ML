Uniqueness of Hamiltonian volume minimizing Lagrangian submanifolds
  which are Hamiltonian isotopic to RP^n in CP^n
The purpose of this short note is to prove the uniqueness of Hamiltonian
volume minimizing Lagrangian submanifolds which are Hamiltonian isotopic to
RP^n in CP^n modulo isometric group actions.
