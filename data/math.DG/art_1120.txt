The first bifurcation point for Delaunay nodoids
We give two numerical methods for computing the first bifurcation point for
Delaunay nodoids. With regard to methods for constructing constant mean
curvature surfaces, we conclude that the bifurcation point in the analytic
method of Mazzeo-Pacard is the same as a limiting point encountered in the
integrable systems method of Dorfmeister-Pedit-Wu.
