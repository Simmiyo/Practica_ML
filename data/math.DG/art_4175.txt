A classification of the torsion tensors on almost contact manifolds with
  B-metric
The space of the torsion (0,3)-tensors of the linear connections on almost
contact manifolds with B-metric is decomposed in 15 orthogonal and invariant
subspaces with respect to the action of the structure group. Three known
connections, preserving the structure, are characterized regarding this
classification.
