The Bianchi variety
The totality Lie(V) of all Lie algebra structures on a vector space V over a
field F is an algebraic variety over F on which the group GL(V) acts naturally.
We give an explicit description of Lie(V) for dim V=3 which is based on the
notion of compatibility of Lie algebra structures.
