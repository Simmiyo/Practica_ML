Geometric inequalities on locally conformally flat manifolds
Through the study of some elliptic and parabolic fully nonlinear PDEs, we
establish conformal versions of quermassintegral inequality, the Sobolev
inequality and the Moser-Trudinger inequality for the geometric quantities
associated to the Schouten tensor on locally conformally flat manifolds.
