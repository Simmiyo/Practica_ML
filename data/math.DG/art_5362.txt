ALE Ricci-flat Kahler surfaces and weighted projective spaces
We show that the explicit ALE Ricci-flat Kahler metrics constructed by
Eguchi-Hanson, Gibbons-Hawking, Hitchin and Kronheimer, and their free
quotients are metrics obtained by Tian-Yau techniques. The proof relies on a
construction of good compactifications of Q-Gorenstein deformations of quotient
surface singularities as log del Pezzo surfaces with only cyclic quotient
singularities at infinity.
