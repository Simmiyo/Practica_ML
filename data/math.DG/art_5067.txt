The twisted Kahler-Ricci flow
In this paper we study a generalization of the Kahler-Ricci flow, in which
the Ricci form is twisted by a closed, non-negative (1,1)-form. We show that
when a twisted Kahler-Einstein metric exists, then this twisted flow converges
exponentially. This generalizes a result of Perelman on the convergence of the
Kahler-Ricci flow, and it builds on work of Tian-Zhu.
