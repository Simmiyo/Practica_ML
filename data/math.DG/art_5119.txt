Weierstrass representation for semi-discrete minimal surfaces, and
  comparison of various discretized catenoids
We give a Weierstrass type representation for semi-discrete minimal surfaces
in Euclidean 3-space. We then give explicit parametrizations of various smooth,
semi-discrete and fully-discrete catenoids, determined from either variational
or integrable systems principles. Finally, we state the shared properties that
those various catenoids have.
