Constancy of $φ-$holomorphic scetional curvature in generalized
  $g.f.f-$manifolds
Tanno [6] provided an algebraic characterization in an almost Hermitian
manifold to reduce to a space of constant holomorphic sectional curvature,
which he later extended for the Sasakian manifolds as well. In this present
paper, we generalize the same characterization in generalized
$g.f.f-$manifolds.
