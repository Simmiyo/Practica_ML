Complete minimal hypersurfaces in the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^4$
  with vanishing Gauss-Kronecker curvature
We investigate 3-dimensional complete minimal hypersurfaces in the hyperbolic
space $\mathbb{H}^{4}$ with Gauss-Kronecker curvature identically zero. More
precisely, we give a classification of complete minimal hypersurfaces with
Gauss-Kronecker curvature identically zero, nowhere vanishing second
fundamental form and scalar curvature bounded from below.
