Gray Curvature Identities for Almost Contact Metric Manifolds
The aim of this research is the study of Gray curvature identities,
introduced by Alfred Gray in \cite{kn:Gra76} for the class of almost hermitian
manifolds. As known till now, there is no equivalent for the class of almost
contact manifolds. For this purpose we use the Boohby-Wang fibration and the
warped manifolds construction in order to establish which identities could be
satisfied by an almost contact manifold.
