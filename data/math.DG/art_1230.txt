Totally geodesic submanifolds in the tangent bundle of a Riemannian
  2-manifold
We give a full description of totally geodesic submanifolds in the tangent
bundle of a Riemannian 2-manifold of constant curvature and present a new class
of a cylinder-type totally geodesic submanifolds in the general case.
