The space of hermitian triples and the Ashtekar - Isham quantization
It was pointed out that the space of hermitian triples is an anology of the
hermitian connection space. Generalizing the Ashtekar - Isham procedure one can
quantize the space of hermitian triples as well as the original one. Here we
add an example how this similarity can be exploited in a quantum theory of
riemannian geometry.
