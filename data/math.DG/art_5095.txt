Polar manifolds and actions
A group action is called polar if there exists an immersed submanifold (a
section) which intersects all orbits orthogonally. Such group actions have been
studied extensively on symmetric spaces. We show how to construct a manifold
admitting a polar group action by prescribing their isotropy groups along a
fundamental domain, generalizing the classical construction for cohomogeneity
manifolds. We give many examples showing the richness of this class of group
actions. We also relate the topology of the section to the topology of the
manifold.
  This is a replacement of an earlier version. Small changes, and a correction
in Lemma 2.4.
