A new weight system on chord diagrams via hyperkähler geometry
A weight system on graph homology was constructed by Rozansky and Witten
using a compact hyperk\"ahler manifold. A variation of this construction
utilizing holomorphic vector bundles over the manifold gives a weight system on
chord diagrams. We investigate these weights from the hyperk\"ahler geometry
point of view.
