Higher type adjunction inequalities for Donaldson invariants
We prove new adjunction inequalities for embedded surfaces in four-manifolds
with non-negative self-intersection number by using the Donaldson invariants.
These formulas are completely analogous to the ones obtained by Ozsv\'ath and
Szab\'o using the Seiberg-Witten invariants. To prove these relations, we give
a fairly explicit description of the structure of the Fukaya-Floer homology of
a surface times a circle. As an aside, we also relate the Floer homology of a
surface times a circle with the cohomology of some symmetric products of the
surface.
