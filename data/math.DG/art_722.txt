The energy-momentum tensor as a second fundamental form
We show that it is natural to consider the energy-momentum tensor associated
with a spinor field as the second fundamental form of an isommetric immersion.
In particular we give a generalization of the warped product construction over
a Riemannian manifold leading to this interpretation. Special sections of the
spinor bundle, generalizing the notion of Killing spinor, are studied. First
applications of such a construction are then given.
