Generalized Complex and Dirac Structures on Homogeneous Spaces
We partially describe equivariant Dirac and generalized complex structures on
a homogeneous space $G/K$ by giving equivalent data involving only the Lie
algebra. We consider real semisimple adjoint orbits in any semisimple Lie
algebra over $\mathbb R$ and real nilpotent orbits in $sl_n (\mathbb R)$. We
give a complete classification for Riemannian symmetric spaces and for a
compact group modulo a closed, connected subgroup containing a Cartan subgroup.
