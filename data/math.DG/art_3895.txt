Lagrangian angles of family of Lagrangian fibrations under mean
  curvature flow
In this paper, we discuss the Lagrangian angles of a family of Lagrangian
fibrations moved under mean curvature flow. In the case $n=1$, the angle
function is shown to satisfy a degenerated partial differential equation. We
prove that any smooth solution to the equation also corresponds to smooth
foliation of curves under mean curvature flow.
