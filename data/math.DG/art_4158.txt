Ricci flow and the holonomy group
We prove that the restricted holonomy group of a complete smooth solution to
the Ricci flow of uniformly bounded curvature cannot spontaneously contract in
finite time; it follows, then, from an earlier result of Hamilton that the
holonomy group is exactly preserved by the equation. In particular, a solution
to the Ricci flow may be K\"{a}hler or locally reducible (as a product) at $t=
T$ if and only if the same is true of $g(t)$ at times $t\leq T$.
