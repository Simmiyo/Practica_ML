The Gauss map of Minimal graphs in the Heisenberg group
In this paper we study some geometric properties of surfaces in the
Heisenberg group, $\mathcal{H}_{3}.$ We obtain, using the Gauss map for Lie
groups, a partial classification of minimal graphs in $\mathcal{H}_{3}.$ We
also proof the non existence of umbilical surfaces in $\mathcal{H}_{3}.$
