Curvature estimates for irreducible symmetric spaces
By making use of the classification of real simple Lie algebra, we get the
maximum of the squared length of restricted roots case by case, thus we get the
upper bounds of sectional curvature for irreducible Riemannian symmetric spaces
of compact type. As an application, we verify Sampson's conjecture in all cases
for irreducible Riemannian symmetric spaces of noncompact type.
