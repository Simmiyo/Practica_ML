Harmonic morphisms from homogeneous Hadamard manifolds
We present a new method for manufacturing complex-valued harmonic morphisms
from a wide class of Riemannian Lie groups. This yields new solutions from an
important family of homogeneous Hadamard manifolds. We also give a new method
for constructing left-invariant foliations on a large class of Lie groups
producing harmonic morphisms
