Calibrations and isoperimetric profiles
We equip many non compact non simply connected surfaces with smooth
Riemannian metrics whose isoperimetric profile is smooth, a highly non generic
property. The computation of the profile is based on a calibration argument, a
rearrangement argument, the Bol-Fiala curvature dependent inequality, together
with new results on the profile of surfaces of revolution and some hardware
know-how.
