Extension d'un feuilletage de Lie minimal d'une variété compacte
The purpose of this paper is to show that any extension of a minimal Lie
foliation on a compact manifold is a transversaly Riemannian g\h- foliation
with trivial normal bundle. This result permits to classify the extensions of a
minimal Lie foliation on a compact manifold from the Lie subgroups of its Lie
group.
