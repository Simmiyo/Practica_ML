Distinguished dimensions for special Riemannian geometries
The paper is based on relations between a ternary symmetric form defining the
SO(3) geometry in dimension five and Cartan's works on isoparametric
hypersurfaces in spheres. As observed by Bryant such a ternary form exists only
in dimensions n_k=3k+2, where k=1,2,4,8. In these dimensions it reduces the
orthogonal group to the subgroups H_k\subset SO(n_k), with H_1=SO(3),
H_2=SU(3), H_4=Sp(3) and H_8=F_4. This enables studies of special Riemannian
geometries with structure groups H_k in dimensions n_k. The neccessary and
sufficient conditions for the H_k geometries to admit the characteristic
connection are given. As an illustration nontrivial examples of SU(3)
geometries in dimension 8 admitting characteristic connection are provided.
Among them there are examples having nonvanishing torsion and satisfying
Einstein equations with respect to either the Levi-Civita or the characteristic
connections.
