Curvature in Synthetic Differential Geometry of Groupoids
We study the fundamental properties of curvature in groupoids within the
framework of synthetic differential geometry. As is usual in synthetic
differential geometry, its combinatorial nature is emphasized. In particular,
the classical Bianchi identity is deduced from its combinatorial one.
