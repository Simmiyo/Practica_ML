Singularities and bifurcations of 3-dimensional Poisson structure
We give a normal form for families of 3-dimensional Poisson structures. This
allows us to classify singularities with nonzero 1-jet and typical
bifurcations. The Appendix contains corollaries on classification of families
of integrable 1-forms on $R^3
