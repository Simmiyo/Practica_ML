Integrable equations of the dispersionless Hirota type and hypersurfaces
  in the Lagrangian Grassmannian
We investigate integrable second order equations of the form
  F(u_{xx}, u_{xy}, u_{yy}, u_{xt}, u_{yt}, u_{tt})=0.
  Familiar examples include the Boyer-Finley equation, the potential form of
the dispersionless Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation, the dispersionless Hirota
equation, etc. The integrability is understood as the existence of infinitely
many hydrodynamic reductions. We demonstrate that the natural equivalence group
of the problem is isomorphic to Sp(6), revealing a remarkable correspondence
between differential equations of the above type and hypersurfaces of the
Lagrangian Grassmannian. We prove that the moduli space of integrable equations
of the dispersionless Hirota type is 21-dimensional, and the action of the
equivalence group Sp(6) on the moduli space has an open orbit.
