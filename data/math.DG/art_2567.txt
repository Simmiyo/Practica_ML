A Connection on Manifolds with a Nilpotent Structure
All the connections, pure toward the nilpotent structure, are found. Examples
of manifolds, for which the curvature tensor is pure or hybrid, are given. For
a manifold of B-type a necessary and sufficient condition for purity of the
curvature tensor is proved. It is verified that the conformal change of the
metric of a B-manifold does not retain its purity.
