Constant Scalar Curvature of Three Dimensional Surfaces Obtained by the
  Equiform Motion of a Sphere
In this paper we consider the equiform motion of a sphere in Euclidean space
$\mathbf{E}^7$. We study and analyze the corresponding kinematic three
dimensional surface under the hypothesis that its scalar curvature $\mathbf{K}$
is constant. Under this assumption, we prove that $|\mathbf{K}|<2$.
