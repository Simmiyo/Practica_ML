On symplectic manifolds with aspherical symplectic form
We consider closed symplectically aspherical manifolds, i.e. closed
symplectic manifolds $(M,\omega)$ satisfying the condition
$[\omega]|_{\pi_2M}=0$. Rudyak and Oprea [RO] remarked that such manifolds have
nice and controllable homotopy properties. Now it is clear that these
properties are mostly determined by the fact that the strict category weight of
$[\omega]$ equals 2. We apply the theory of strict category weight to the
problem of estimating the number of closed orbits of charged particles in
symplectic magnetic fields. In case of symplectically aspherical manifolds our
theory enables us to improve some known estimations.
