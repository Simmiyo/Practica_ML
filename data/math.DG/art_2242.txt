Parabolic subgroups of semisimple Lie groups and Einstein solvmanifolds
In this paper, we study the solvmanifolds constructed from any parabolic
subalgebras of any semisimple Lie algebras. These solvmanifolds are naturally
homogeneous submanifolds of symmetric spaces of noncompact type. We show that
the Ricci curvatures of our solvmanifolds coincide with the restrictions of the
Ricci curvatures of the ambient symmetric spaces. Consequently, all of our
solvmanifolds are Einstein, which provide a large number of new examples of
noncompact homogeneous Einstein manifolds. We also show that our solvmanifolds
are minimal, but not totally geodesic submanifolds of symmetric spaces.
