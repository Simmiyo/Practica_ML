Sharp upper bound and a comparison theorem for the first nonzero Steklov
  eigenvalue
In this paper we prove that given a volume, among all domains with smooth
boundary in rank-1 symmetric spaces of noncompact type, geodesic balls
maximizes the first nonzero Steklov eigenvalue. We also prove a comparison
result for the first nonzero Steklov eigenvalue for domains in simply connected
Riemannian manifolds with certain curvature bounds.
