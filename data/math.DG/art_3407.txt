On strictly convex subsets in negatively curved manifolds
In a complete simply connected Riemannian manifold X of pinched negative
curvature, we give a sharp criterion for a subset C to be the
epsilon-neighbourhood of some convex subset of X, in terms of the extrinsic
curvatures of the boundary of C.
