Schwarzian Derivatives and Flows of Surfaces
This paper goes some way in explaining how to construct an integrable
hierarchy of flows on the space of conformally immersed tori in n-space. These
flows have first occured in mathematical physics -- the Novikov-Veselov and
Davey-Stewartson hierarchies -- as kernel dimension preserving deformations of
the Dirac operator. Later, using spinorial representations of surfaces, the
same flows were interpreted as deformations of surfaces in 3- and 4-space
preserving the Willmore energy. This last property suggest that the correct
geometric setting for this theory is Moebius invariant surface geometry. We
develop this view point in the first part of the paper where we derive the
fundamental invariants -- the Schwarzian derivative, the Hopf differential and
a normal connection -- of a conformal immersion into n-space together with
their integrability equations. To demonstrate the effectivness of our approach
we discuss and prove a variety of old and new results from conformal surface
theory. In the the second part of the paper we derive the Novikov-Veselov and
Davey-Stewartson flows on conformally immersed tori by Moebius invariant
geometric deformations. We point out the analogy to a similar derivation of the
KdV hierarchy as flows on Schwarzian's of meromorphic functions. Special
surface classes, e.g. Willmore surfaces and isothermic surfaces, are preserved
by the flows.
