Scalar curvature and holomorphy potentials
A holomorphy potential is a complex valued function whose complex gradient,
with respect to some K\"ahler metric, is a holomorphic vector field. Given $k$
holomorphic vector fields on a compact complex manifold, form, for a given
K\"ahler metric, a product of the following type: a function of the scalar
curvature multiplied by functions of the holomorphy potentials of each of the
vector fields. It is shown that the stipulation that such a product be itself a
holomorphy potential for yet another vector field singles out critical metrics
for a particular functional. This may be regarded as a generalization of the
extremal metric variation of Calabi, where $k=0$ and the functional is the
square of the $L^2$-norm of the scalar curvature. The existence question for
such metrics is examined in a number of special cases. Examples are constructed
in the case of certain multifactored product manifolds. For the \sk metrics
investigated by Derdzinski and Maschler and residing in the complex projective
space, it is shown that only one type of nontrivial criticality holds in
dimension three and above.
