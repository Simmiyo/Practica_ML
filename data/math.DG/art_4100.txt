A natural Finsler--Laplace operator
We give a new definition of a Laplace operator for Finsler metric as an
average with regard to an angle measure of the second directional derivatives.
This definition uses a dynamical approach due to Foulon that does not require
the use of connections nor local coordinates. We show using 1-parameter
families of Katok--Ziller metrics that this Finsler--Laplace operator admits
explicit representations and computations of spectral data.
