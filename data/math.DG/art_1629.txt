Natural and projectively equivariant quantizations by means of Cartan
  Connections
The existence of a natural and projectively equivariant quantization in the
sense of Lecomte [20] was proved recently by M. Bordemann [4], using the
framework of Thomas-Whitehead connections. We give a new proof of existence
using the notion of Cartan projective connections and we obtain an explicit
formula in terms of these connections. Our method yields the existence of a
projectively equivariant quantization if and only if an \sl(m+1,\R)-equivariant
quantization exists in the flat situation in the sense of [18], thus solving
one of the problems left open by M. Bordemann.
