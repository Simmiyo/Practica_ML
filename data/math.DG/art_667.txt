Orbits of families of vector fields on subcartesian spaces
Orbits of families of vector fields on a subcartesian space are shown to be
smooth manifolds. This allows for a global description of a smooth geometric
structure on a family of manifolds in terms of a single object defined on the
corresponding family of vector fields. Stratified spaces, Poisson spaces and
almost complex spaces are discussed.
