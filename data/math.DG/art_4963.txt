Nonpositively curved manifolds containing a prescribed nonpositively
  curved hypersurface
We use pinched smooth hyperbolization to show that every closed,
nonpositively curved $n$-dimensional manifold $M$ can be embedded as a totally
geodesic submanifold of a closed, nonpositively curved $(n+1)$-dimensional
manifold $\hat{M}$ of geometric rank one.
