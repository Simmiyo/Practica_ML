Cocalibrated structures on Lie algebras with a codimension one Abelian
  ideal
Cocalibrated G_2-structures and cocalibrated G_2^*-structures are the natural
initial values for Hitchin's evolution equations whose solutions define
(pseudo)-Riemannian manifolds with holonomy group contained in Spin(7) or
Spin_0(3,4), respectively. In this article, we classify which seven-dimensional
real Lie algebras with a codimension one Abelian ideal admit such structures.
Moreover, we classify the seven-dimensional complex Lie algebras with a
codimension one Abelian ideal which admit cocalibrated (G_2)_C-structures.
