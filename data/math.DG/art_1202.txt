Ancient solution to Kahler-Ricci flow
In this paper, we prove that any non-flat ancient solution to K\"ahler-Ricci
flow with bounded nonnegative bisectional curvature has asymptotic volume ratio
zero. We also prove that any gradient shrinking solitons with positive
bisectional curvature must be compact. Both results generalize the
corresponding earlier results of Perelman in \cite{P1} and \cite{P2}. The
results can be applied to study the geometry and function theory of complete
K\"ahler manifolds with nonnegative bisectional curvature via K\"ahler-Ricci
flow. It also implies a compactness theorem on ancient solutions to
K\"ahler-Ricci flow.
