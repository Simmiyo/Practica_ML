Functorial prolongations of some functional bundles
We discuss two kinds of functorial prolongations of the functional bundle of
all smooth maps between the fibers over the same base point of two fibered
manifolds over the same base. We study the prolongation of vector fields in
both cases and we prove that the bracket is preserved. Our proof is based on
several new results concerning the finite dimensional Weil bundles.
