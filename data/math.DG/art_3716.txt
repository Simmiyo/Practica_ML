Darboux transforms and simple factor dressing of constant mean curvature
  surfaces
We define a transformation on harmonic maps from a Riemann surface into the
2-sphere which depends on a complex parameter, the so-called mu-Darboux
transformation. In the case when the harmonic map N is the Gauss map of a
constant mean curvature surface f and the parameter is real, the mu-Darboux
transformation of -N is the Gauss map of a classical Darboux transform f. More
generally, for all complex parameter the transformation on the harmonic Gauss
map of f is induced by a (generalized) Darboux transformation on f. We show
that this operation on harmonic maps coincides with simple factor dressing, and
thus generalize results on classical Darboux transforms of constant mean
curvature surfaces: every mu-Darboux transform is a simple factor dressing, and
vice versa.
