Curvature and symmetry of Milnor spheres
In this paper we explore the geometry and topology of cohomogeneity one
manifolds, i.e. manifolds with a group action whose principal orbits are
hypersurfaces. We show that the principal group action of every principal SO(3)
and SO(4) bundle over S^4 extends to a cohomogeneity one action. As a
consequence we prove that every vector bundle and every sphere bundle over S^4
has a complete metric with non-negative curvature. It is well known that 15 of
the 27 exotic spheres in dimension 7 can be written as S^3 bundles over S^4 in
infinitely many ways, and hence we obtain infinitely many non-negatively curved
metrics on these exotic spheres. A further consequence will be that there are
infinitely many almost free actions by SO(3) on S^7, i.e. all isotropy groups
are finite. These actions preserve the Hopf fibration S^3 -> S^7 -> S^4 but do
not extend to the disc D^8. We also construct infinitely many such actions on
the 15 exotic 7-spheres mentioned above.
