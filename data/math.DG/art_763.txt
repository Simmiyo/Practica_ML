Recent progress in Kähler geometry
In recent years, there are many progress made in K\"ahler geometry. In
particular, the topics related to the problems of the existence and uniqueness
of extremal K\"ahler metrics, as well as obstructions to the existence of such
metrics in general K\"ahler manifold. In this talk, we will report some recent
developments in this direction. In particular, we will discuss the progress
recently obtained in understanding the metric structure of the infinite
dimensional space of Kaehler potentials, and their applications to the problems
mentioned above. We also will discuss some recent on Kaehler Ricci flow.
