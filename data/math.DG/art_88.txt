Invariant Forms and Automorphisms of Locally Homogeneous Multisymplectic
  Manifolds
It is shown that the geometry of locally homogeneous multisymplectic
manifolds (that is, smooth manifolds equipped with a closed nondegenerate form
of degree > 1, which is locally homogeneous of degree k with respect to a local
Euler field) is characterized by their automorphisms. Thus, locally homogeneous
multisymplectic manifolds extend the family of classical geometries possessing
a similar property: symplectic, volume and contact. The proof of the first
result relies on the characterization of invariant differential forms with
respect to the graded Lie algebra of infinitesimal automorphisms, and on the
study of the local properties of Hamiltonian vector fields on locally
multisymplectic manifolds. In particular it is proved that the group of
multisymplectic diffeomorphisms acts (strongly locally) transitively on the
manifold. It is also shown that the graded Lie algebra of infinitesimal
automorphisms of a locally homogeneous multisymplectic manifold characterizes
their multisymplectic diffeomorphisms.
