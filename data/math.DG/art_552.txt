Mirror symmetry and self-dual manifolds
We introduce self-dual manifolds and show that they can be used to encode
mirror symmetry for affine-K\"{a}hler manifolds and for elliptic curves. Their
geometric properties, especially the link with special lagrangian fibrations
and the existence of a transformation similar to the Fourier-Mukai functor,
suggest that this approach may be able to explain mirror symmetry also in other
situations
