Conformal compactification of asymptotically locally hyperbolic metrics
In this paper we study the extent to which conformally compact asymptotically
hyperbolic metrics may be characterized intrinsically. Building on the work of
the first author, we prove that decay of sectional curvature to -1 and decay of
covariant derivatives of curvature outside an appropriate compact set yield
H\"older regularity for a conformal compactification of the metric. In the
Einstein case, we prove that the estimate on the sectional curvature implies
the control of all covariant derivatives of the Weyl tensor, permitting us to
strengthen our result.
