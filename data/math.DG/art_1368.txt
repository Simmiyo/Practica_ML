To specify surfaces of revolution with pointwise 1-type Gauss map in
  3-dimensional Minkowski space
In this paper, by the studying of the Gauss map, Laplacian operator,
curvatures of surfaces in $\mathbb{R}_{1}^{3}$ and Bour's theorem, we are going
to identify surfaces of revolution with pointwise 1-type Gauss map property in
$3-$dimensional Minkowski space.
