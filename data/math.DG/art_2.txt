Nonunique tangent maps at isolated singularities of harmonic maps
Shoen and Uhlenbeck showed that ``tangent maps'' can be defined at singular
points of energy minimizing maps. Unfortunately these are not unique, even for
generic boundary conditions. Examples are discussed which have isolated
singularities with a continuum of distinct tangent maps.
