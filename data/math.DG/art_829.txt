PseudoH-type 2-step nilpotent Lie groups
PseudoH-type is a natural generalization of H-type to geometries with
indefinite metric tensors. We give a complete determination of the conjugate
locus including multiplicities. We also obtain a partial characterization in
terms of the abundance of totally geodesic, 3-dimensional submanifolds.
