Quaternionic Kaehler manifolds with Hermitian and Norden metrics
Almost hypercomplex manifolds with Hermitian and Norden metrics and more
specially the corresponding quaternionic Kaehler manifolds are considered. Some
necessary and sufficient conditions the investigated manifolds be isotropic
hyper-Kaehlerian and flat are found. It is proved that the quaternionic Kaehler
manifolds with the considered metric structure are Einstein for dimension at
least 8. The class of the non-hyper-Kaehler quaternionic Kaehler manifold of
the considered type is determined.
