Partial collapsing and the spectrum of the Hodge Laplacian
The goal of the present paper is to calculate the limit spectrum of the
Hodge-de Rham operator under the perturbation of collapsing one part of a
manifold obtained by gluing together two manifolds with the same boundary. It
appears to take place in the general problem of blowing up conical
singularities as introduced in \cite{Maz} and \cite{Row1,Row2}.
