Adiabatic Limits and Foliations
We use adiabatic limits to study foliated manifolds. The Bott connection
naturally shows up as the adiabatic limit of Levi-Civita connections. As an
application, we then construct certain natural elliptic operators associated to
the foliation and present a direct geometric proof of a vanshing theorem of
Connes[Co], which extends the Lichnerowicz vanishing theorem [L] to foliated
manifolds with spin leaves, for what we call almost Riemannian foliations.
Several new vanishing theorems are also proved by using our method.
