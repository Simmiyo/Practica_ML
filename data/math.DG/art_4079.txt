On the twistor space of a quaternionic contact manifold
In this note, we prove that the CR manifold which is induced from the
canonical parabolic geometry of a quaternionic contact (qc) manifold via a
Fefferman-type construction is equivalent to the CR twistor space of the qc
manifold defined by O. Biquard.
