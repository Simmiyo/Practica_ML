Dynamical properties of the space of Lorentzian metrics
We study the mechanisms of the non properness of the action of the group of
diffeomorphisms on the space of Lorentzian metrics of a compact manifold. In
particular, we prove that nonproperness entails the presence of lightlike
geodesic foliations of codimension 1. On the 2-torus, we prove that a metric
with constant curvature along one of its lightlike foliation is actually flat.
This allows us to show that the restriction of the action to the set of
non-flat metrics is proper and that on the set of flat metrics of volume 1 the
action is ergodic. Finally, we show that, contrarily to the Riemannian case,
the space of metrics without isometries is not always open.
