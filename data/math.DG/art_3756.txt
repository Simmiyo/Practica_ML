Inequalities for eigenvalues of the buckling problem of arbitrary order
This paper studies eigenvalues of the buckling problem of arbitrary order on
bounded domains in Euclidean spaces and spheres. We prove universal bounds for
the k-th eigenvalue in terms of the lower ones independent of the domains. Our
results strengthen the recent work in [28] and generalize Cheng-Yang's recent
estimates [16] on the buckling eigenvalues of order two to arbitrary order.
