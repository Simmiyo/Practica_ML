Minimal Surface Linear Combinatoin Theorem
Given two univalent harmonic mappings $f_1$ and $f_2$ on $\mathbb{D}$, which
lift to minimal surfaces via the Weierstrass-Enneper representation theorem, we
give necessary and sufficient conditions for $f_3=(1-s)f_1+sf_2$ to lift to a
minimal surface for $s\in[0,1]$. We then construct such mappings from Enneper's
surface to Scherk's singularly periodic surface, Sckerk's doubly periodic
surface to the catenoid, and the 4-Enneper surface to the 4-noid.
