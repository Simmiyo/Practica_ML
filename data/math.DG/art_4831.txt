Evolution equations of curvature tensors along the hyperbolic geometric
  flow
We consider the hyperbolic geometric flow $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial
t^2}g(t)=-2Ric_{g(t)}$ introduced by Kong and Liu [KL]. When the Riemannian
metric evolve, then so does its curvature. Using the techniques and ideas of
S.Brendle [Br,BS], we derive evolution equations for the Levi-Civita connection
and the curvature tensors along the hyperbolic geometric flow. The method and
results are computed and written in global tensor form, different from the
local normal coordinate method in [DKL1]. In addition, we further show that any
solution to the hyperbolic geometric flow that develops a singularity in finite
time has unbounded Ricci curvature.
