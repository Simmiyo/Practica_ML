Seifert fiberings and collapsing of infrasolv spaces
We give a purely geometrical smooth characterization of closed infrasolv
manifolds and orbifolds by showing that, up to diffeomorphism, these are
precisely the spaces which admit a collapse with bounded curvature and diameter
to compact flat orbifolds. Moreover, we distinguish irreducible smooth fake
tori geometrically from standard ones by proving that the former have
non-vanishing D-minimal volume.
