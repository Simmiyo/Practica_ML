Optimal homeomorphisms between closed curves
The concept of natural pseudo-distance has proven to be a powerful tool for
measuring the dissimilarity between topological spaces endowed with continuous
real-valued functions. Roughly speaking, the natural pseudo-distance is defined
as the infimum of the change of the functions' values, when moving from one
space to the other through homeomorphisms, if possible. In this paper, we prove
the first available result about the existence of optimal homeomorphisms
between closed curves, i.e. inducing a change of the function that equals the
natural pseudo-distance.
