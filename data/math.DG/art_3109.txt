Position vectors of a spacelike general helices in Minkowski Space
  $\e_1^3$
In this paper, position vector of a spacelike general helix with respect to
standard frame in Minkowski space E$^3_1$ are studied in terms of Frenet
equations. First, a vector differential equation of third order is constructed
to determine position vector of an arbitrary spacelike general helix. In terms
of solution, we determine the parametric representation of the general helices
from the intrinsic equations. Moreover, we give some examples to illustrate how
to find the position vectors of a spacelike general helices with a spacelike
and timelike principal normal vector from the intrinsic equations.
