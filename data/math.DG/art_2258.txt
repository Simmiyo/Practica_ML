Intrinsic characterization for Lipschitz asymptotically hyperbolic
  metrics
Conformally compact asymptotically hyperbolic metrics have been intensively
studied. The goal of this note is to understand what intrinsic conditions on a
complete Riemannian manifold (M,g) will ensure that g is asymptotically
hyperbolic in this sense. We use the geodesic compactification by asymptotic
geodesic rays to compactify M and appropriate curvature decay conditions to
study the regularity of the conformal compactification. We also present an
interesting example that shows our conclusion is nearly optimal for our
assumptions.
