Holomorphic spinors and the Dirac equation
A closed spin K\"ahler manifold of positive scalar curvature with smallest
possible first eigenvalue of the Dirac operator is characterized by holomorphic
spinors. It is shown that on any spin K\"ahler-Einstein manifold each
holomorphic spinor is a finite sum of eigenspinors of the square of the Dirac
operator. Vanishing theorems for holomorphic spinors are proved.
