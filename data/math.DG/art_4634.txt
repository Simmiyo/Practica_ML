Pseudo-Riemannian Symmetries on Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}_{3}$
The notion of $\Gamma$-symmetric space is a natural generalization of the
classical notion of symmetric space based on $\z_2$-grading of Lie algebras. In
our case, we consider homogeneous spaces $G/H$ such that the Lie algebra $\g$
of $G$ admits a $\Gamma$-grading where $\Gamma$ is a finite abelian group. In
this work we study Riemannian metrics and Lorentzian metrics on the Heisenberg
group $\mathbb{H}_3$ adapted to the symmetries of a $\Gamma$-symmetric
structure on $\mathbb{H}_3$. We prove that the classification of
$\z_2^2$-symmetric Riemannian and Lorentzian metrics on $\mathbb{H}_3$
corresponds to the classification of left invariant Riemannian and Lorentzian
metrics, up to isometries. This gives examples of non-symmetric Lorentzian
homogeneous spaces.
