Equivariant Chern characters with generalized coefficients
These notes form the next episode in a series of articles dedicated to a
detailed proof of a cohomological index formula for transversally elliptic
pseudo-differential operators and applications. The first two chapters are
already available as math.DG/0702575 and arXiv:0711.3898. In this episode, we
construct the relative equivariant Chern character of a morphism of vector
bundles, localized by a one form, and we prove a multiplicativity property of
this generalized Chern character
