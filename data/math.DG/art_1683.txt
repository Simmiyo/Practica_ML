Left-invariant almost nearly Kähler structures on $SU(2)\times SU(2)$
  in the tetrahedron visualization for $CP^3$
The set of maximal non-integrable structures $(SU(2)\times SU(2),B,I)$, where
$B$ is Killing-Cartan metric is described as subset of $\mathbb{CP}^3$. The
visualization of complex projective space $\mathbb{CP}^3$ as tetrahedron which
edges and faces are $\mathbb{CP}^1$ and $\mathbb{CP}^2$ is used.
