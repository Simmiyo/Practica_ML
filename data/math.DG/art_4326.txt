Degree 3 algebraic minimal surfaces in the 3-sphere
We give a local analytic characterization that a minimal surface in the
3-sphere $\, \ES^3 \subset \R^4$ defined by an irreducible cubic polynomial is
one of the Lawson's minimal tori. This provides an alternative proof of the
result by Perdomo (\emph{Characterization of order 3 algebraic immersed minimal
surfaces of $S^3$},Geom. Dedicata 129 (2007), 23--34).
