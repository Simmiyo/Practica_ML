An Introduction to Harmonic Manifolds and the Lichnerowicz Conjecture
The title is self-explanatory. We aim to give an easy to read and
self-contained introduction to the field of harmonic manifolds. Only basic
knowledge of Riemannian geometry is required. After we gave the definition of
harmonicity and derived some properties, we concentrate on Z. I. Szab\'o's
proof of Lichnerowicz's conjecture in the class of compact simply connected
manifolds.
