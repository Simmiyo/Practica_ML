Remarks on a scalar curvature rigidity theorem of Brendle and Marques
In this paper, we provide some remarks on the scalar curvature rigidity
theorem of Brendle and Marques in \cite{BrendleMarques}. The main result is
that Brendle and Marques' theorem holds on a geodesic ball larger than that
specified in [2].
