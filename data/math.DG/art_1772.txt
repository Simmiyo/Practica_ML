Cross Ratios and Identities for Higher Thurston Theory
We generalise in this article the Mc Shane-Mirzakhani identities in
hyperbolic geometry to arbitrary cross ratios. We give an expression of them in
the case of Hitchin representations of surface groups in PSL(n, R) in a
suitable choice of Fock-Goncharov coordinates.
