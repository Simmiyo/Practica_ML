The mean curvature integral is invariant under bending
Suppose M_t is a smooth family of compact connected two dimensional
submanifolds of Euclidean space E^3 without boundary varying isometrically in
their induced Riemannian metrics. Then we show that the mean curvature
integrals over M_t are constant. It is unknown whether there are nontrivial
such bendings. The estimates also hold for periodic manifolds for which there
are nontrivial bendings. In addition, our methods work essentially without
change to show the similar results for submanifolds of H^n and S^n. The
rigidity of the mean curvature integral can be used to show new rigidity
results for isometric embeddings and provide new proofs of some well-known
results. This, together with far-reaching extensions of the results of the
present note is done in the preprint: I Rivin, J-M Schlenker, Schlafli formula
and Einstein manifolds, IHES preprint (1998). Our result should be compared
with the well-known formula of Herglotz.
