The spinorial τ-invariant and 0-dimensional surgery
Let $M$ be a compact manifold with a metric $g$ and with a fixed spin
structure $\chi$. Let $\lambda\_1^+(g)$ be the first non-negative eigenvalue of
the Dirac operator on $(M,g,\chi)$. We set $$\tau(M,\chi):= \sup \inf
\lambda\_1^+(g)$$ where the infimum runs over all metrics $g$ of volume 1 in a
conformal class $[g\_0]$ on $M$ and where the supremum runs over all conformal
classes $[g\_0]$ on $M$. Let $(M^#,\chi^#)$ be obtained from $(M,\chi)$ by
0-dimensional surgery. We prove that $$\tau(M^#,\chi^#)\geq \tau(M,\chi).$$ As
a corollary we can calculate $\tau(M,\chi)$ for any Riemann surface $M$.
