Explicit Formulas for Non-Geodesic Biharmonic Curves of the Heisenberg
  Group
We consider the biharmonicity condition for maps between Riemannian manifolds
(see [BK]), and study the non-geodesic biharmonic curves in the Heisenberg
group H_3. First we prove that all of them are helices, and then we obtain
explicitly their parametric equations.
