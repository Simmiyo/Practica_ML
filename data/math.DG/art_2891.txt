Hypersurfaces M^n in S^k x H^n-k+1
Let $\psi:\M \to \SH$ be an isometric immersion of codimension 1, then there
exist symmetric $(1,1)$-tensors $S$ and $f$, a tangent vector field $U$ and a
smooth function $\lambda$ on $\M$ that satisfy the compatibility equations of
$\SH$. In this paper, we will deal with the converse problem: "Given a
Riemannian manifold $\M$ with symmetric $(1,1)$-tensors $S$ and $f$, tangent
vector field $U$ and smooth function $\lambda$ satisfying the conditions
mentioned above, can $\M$ then be isometrically immersed in $\SH$ in such a way
that $(g,S,f,U,\lambda)$ is realized as the induced structure?".
