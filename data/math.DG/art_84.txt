Stationary Veselov-Novikov equation and isothermally asymptotic surfaces
  in projective differential geometry
It is demonstrated that the stationary Veselov-Novikov (VN) and the
stationary modified Veselov-Novikov (mVN) equations describe one and the same
class of surfaces in projective differential geometry: the so-called
isothermally asymptotic surfaces, examples of which include arbitrary quadrics
and cubics, quartics of Kummer, projective transforms of affine spheres and
rotation surfaces. The stationary mVN equation arises in the Wilczynski
approach and plays the role of the projective "Gauss-Codazzi" equations, while
the stationary VN equation follows from the Lelieuvre representation of
surfaces in 3-space. This implies an explicit Backlund transformation between
the stationary VN and mVN equations which is an analog of the Miura
transformation between their (1+1)-dimensional limits.
