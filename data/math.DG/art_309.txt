Self-dual Einstein Hermitian four manifolds
We provide a local classification of self-dual Einstein Riemannian four
manifolds admitting a positively oriented Hermitian structure and characterize
those which carry a hyperhermitian, non-hyperk\"ahlerian structure compatible
with the negative orientation. We finally show that self-dual Einstein
4-manifolds obtained as quaternionic quotients of the Wolf spaces ${\mathbb
H}P^2$, ${\mathbb H}H^2$, $SU(4)/S(U(2)U(2))$, and $SU(2,2)/S(U(2)U(2))$ are
always Hermitian.
