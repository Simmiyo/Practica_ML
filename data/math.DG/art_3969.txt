A remark on "Connections and Higgs fields on a principal bundle"
We show that a unipotent vector bundle on a non-Kaehler compact complex
manifold does not admit a flat holomorphic connection in general. We also
construct examples of topologically trivial stable vector bundle on compact
Gauduchon manifold that does not admit any unitary flat connection.
