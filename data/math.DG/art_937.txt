Classification of Material G-structures
A geometrical interpretation of the $G$-structures associated to elastic
material bodies is given. In addition, characterizations of their integrability
are obtained. Since the lack of integrability is a geometrical measure of the
lack of homogeneity, the corresponding inhomogeneity conditions are obtained
