On equivalency of various geometric structures
In the literature we see that after introducing a geometric structure by
imposing some restrictions on Riemann-Christoffel curvature tensor, the same
type structure given by imposing same restriction on other curvature tensors
being studied. The main object of the present paper is to study the equivalency
of various geometric structures obtained by same restriction imposing on
different curvature tensors. In this purpose we present a tensor by combining
Riemann-Christoffel curvature tensor, Ricci tensor, the metric tensor and
scalar curvature which describe various curvature tensors as its particular
cases.
