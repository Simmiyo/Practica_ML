A New Construction of Isospectral Riemannian Nilmanifolds with Examples
We present a new construction for obtaining pairs of higher-step isospectral
Riemannian nilmanifolds and compare several resulting new examples. In
particular, we present new examples of manifolds that are isospectral on
functions, but not isospectral on one-forms.
