The Yamabe problem for Gauss-Bonnet curvatures: a local result around
  space forms
It is shown in the paper "Variational Properties of the Gauss-Bonnet
Curvatures" of M.L. Labbi, that metrics with constant 2k-Gauss-Bonnet curvature
on a closed n-dimensional manifold, 1<2k<n, are critical points for a certain
Hilbert type functional with respect to volume preserving conformal variations.
This motivates the corresponding Yamabe problem: is it true that any metric on
a closed manifold is conformal to a metric with constant 2k-Gauss-Bonnet
curvature? Using perturbative methods we affirmatively answer this question for
small perturbations of certain space forms. More precisely, if (X,g) is a
non-flat closed space form not isometric to a round sphere, we show the
existence of a neighborhood U, of g, in the space of metrics such that any g'
in U is conformal to a metric whose 2k-Gauss-Bonnet curvature is constant.
