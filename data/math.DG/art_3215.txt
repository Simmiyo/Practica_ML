Canonical Coordinates and Principal Directions for Surfaces in
  $\H^2\times\R$
In this paper we characterize and classify surfaces in
${\mathbb{H}}^2\times{\mathbb{R}}$ which have a canonical principal direction.
Here ${\mathbb{H}}^2$ denotes the hyperbolic plane. We study some geometric
properties such as minimality and flatness. Some examples are given to complete
the study.
