On the moment map on symplectic manifolds
We consider a connected symplectic manifold $M$ acted on by a connected Lie
group $G$ in a Hamiltonian fashion. If $G$ is compact, we prove give an
Equivalence Theorem for the symplectic manifolds whose squared moment map
$\parallel \mu \parallel^2$ is constant. This result works also in the
almost-K\"ahler setting. Then we study the case when $G$ is a non compact Lie
group acting properly on $M$ and we prove a splitting results for symplectic
manifolds.
