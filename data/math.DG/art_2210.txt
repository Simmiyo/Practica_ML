Affine Classification of n-Curves
Classification of curves up to affine transformation in a finite dimensional
space was studied by some different methods. In this paper, we achieve the
exact formulas of affine invariants via the equivalence problem and in the view
of Cartan's lemma and then, state a necessary and sufficient condition for
classification of n--Curves.
