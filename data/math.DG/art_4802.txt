Spectral positivity and Riemannian coverings
Let $(M,g)$ be a complete non-compact Riemannian manifold. We consider
operators of the form $\Delta_g + V$, where $\Delta_g$ is the non-negative
Laplacian associated with the metric $g$, and $V$ a locally integrable
function. Let $\rho : (\hat{M},\hat{g}) \to (M,g)$ be a Riemannian covering,
with Laplacian $\Delta_{\hat{g}}$ and potential $\hat{V} = V \circ \rho$. If
the operator $\Delta + V$ is non-negative on $(M,g)$, then the operator
$\Delta_{\hat{g}} + \hat{V}$ is non-negative on $(\hat{M},\hat{g})$. In this
note, we show that the converse statement is true provided that
$\pi_1(\hat{M})$ is a co-amenable subgroup of $\pi_1(M)$.
