Simplicial approach to derived differential manifolds
Derived differential manifolds are constructed using the usual homotopy
theory of simplicial rings of smooth functions. They are proved to be
equivalent to derived differential manifolds of finite type, constructed using
homotopy sheaves of homotopy rings (D.Spivak), thus preserving the classical
cobordism ring. This reduction to the usual algebraic homotopy can potentially
lead to virtual fundamental classes beyond obstruction theory.
