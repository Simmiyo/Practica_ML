Geometric realizations of curvature models by manifolds with constant
  scalar curvature
We show any Riemannian curvature model can be geometrically realized by a
manifold with constant scalar curvature. We also show that any pseudo-Hermitian
curvature model, para-Hermitian curvature model, hyper-pseudo-Hermitian
curvature model, or hyper-para-Hermitian curvature model can be realized by a
manifold with constant scalar and *-scalar curvature.
