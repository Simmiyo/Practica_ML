Fuchsian convex bodies: basics of Brunn--Minkowski theory
The hyperbolic space $ \H^d$ can be defined as a pseudo-sphere in the $(d+1)$
Minkowski space-time. In this paper, a Fuchsian group $\Gamma$ is a group of
linear isometries of the Minkowski space such that $\H^d/\Gamma$ is a compact
manifold. We introduce Fuchsian convex bodies, which are closed convex sets in
Minkowski space, globally invariant for the action of a Fuchsian group. A
volume can be associated to each Fuchsian convex body, and, if the group is
fixed, Minkowski addition behaves well. Then Fuchsian convex bodies can be
studied in the same manner as convex bodies of Euclidean space in the classical
Brunn--Minkowski theory. For example, support functions can be defined, as
functions on a compact hyperbolic manifold instead of the sphere.
  The main result is the convexity of the associated volume (it is log concave
in the classical setting). This implies analogs of Alexandrov--Fenchel and
Brunn--Minkowski inequalities. Here the inequalities are reversed.
