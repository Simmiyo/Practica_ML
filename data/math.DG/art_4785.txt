On the Hopf Conjecture with Symmetry
The Hopf conjecture states that an even-dimensional, positively curved
Riemannian manifold has positive Euler characteristic. We prove this conjecture
under the additional assumption that a torus acts by isometries and has
dimension bounded from below by a logarithmic function of the manifold
dimension. The main new tool is the action of the Steenrod algebra on
cohomology.
