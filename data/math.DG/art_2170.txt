Curvature estimates for minimal submanifolds of higher codimension
We derive curvature estimates for minimal submanifolds in Euclidean space for
arbitrary dimension and codimension via Gauss map. Thus, Schoen-Simon-Yau's
results and Ecker-Huisken's results are generalized to higher codimension. In
this way we improve Hildebrandt-Jost-Widman's result for the Bernstein type
theorem.
