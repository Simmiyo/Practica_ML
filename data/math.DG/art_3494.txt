Some planar isospectral domains
We give a number of examples of isospectral pairs of plane domains, and a
particularly simple method of proving isospectrality. One of our examples is a
pair of domains that are not only isospectral but homophonic: Each domain has a
distinguished point such that corresponding normalized Dirichlet eigenfunctions
take equal values at the distinguished points. This shows that one really can't
hear the shape of a drum.
