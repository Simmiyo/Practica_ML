On M. Mueter's Ph.D. Thesis on Cheeger deformations
These are notes of a talk I gave in a seminar at the University of
Pennsylvania summarizing results in the Ph.D. thesis of Michael Mueter obtained
under the direction of Wolfgang Meyer at the University of Muenster. His thesis
on "Kruemmungserhoehende Deformationen mittels Gruppenaktionen" examines in
detail curvature properties of so called Cheeger deformations. Such
deformations have been a crucial ingredient in non-negative and positive
curvature constructions. His thesis contains a wealth of interesting properties
of such deformations, but since it was never published, is only known to a few
experts. I have no intention to publish these notes, but post them as a service
to the public. A scanned version of his thesis (written in German) is available
on my homepage.
