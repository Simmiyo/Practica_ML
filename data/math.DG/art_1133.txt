Induced connections on submanifolds in spaces with fundamental groups
The authors establish a relation of the theory of varieties with degenerate
Gauss maps in projective spaces with the theory of congruences and
pseudocongruences of subspaces and show how these two theories can be applied
to the construction of induced connections on submanifolds of projective spaces
and other spaces endowed with a projective structure.
