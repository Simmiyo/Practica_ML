Density of Zariski density for surface groups
We show that a surface group contained in a reductive real algebraic group
can be deformed to become Zariski dense, unless its Zariski closure acts
transitively on a Hermitian symmetric space of tube type. This is a kind of
converse to a rigidity result of Burger, Iozzi and Wienhard.
