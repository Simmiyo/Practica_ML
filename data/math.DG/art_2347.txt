Non-proper helicoid-like limits of closed minimal surfaces in
  3-manifolds
We show that there exists a metric with positive scalar curvature on S2xS1
and a sequence of embedded minimal cylinders that converges to a minimal
lamination that, in a neighborhood of a strictly stable 2-sphere, is smooth
except at two helicoid-like singularities on the 2-sphere. The construction is
inspired by a recent example by D. Hoffman and B. White.
