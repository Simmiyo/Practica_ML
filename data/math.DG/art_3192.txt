Locally Compact Contractive Local Groups
We study locally compact contractive local groups, that is, locally compact
local groups with a contractive pseudo-automorphism. We prove that if such an
object is locally connected, then it is locally isomorphic to a Lie group. We
also prove a related structure theorem for locally compact contractive local
groups which are not necessarily locally connected. These results are local
analogues of theorems for locally compact contractive groups.
