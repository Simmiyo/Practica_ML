Calibrated Fibrations on Complete Manifolds via Torus Action
In this paper we will investigate torus actions on complete manifolds with
calibrations. For Calabi-Yau manifolds M^2n with a Hamiltonian
structure-preserving k-torus action we show that any symplectic reduction has a
natural holomorphic volume form. Moreover Special Lagrangian (SLag)
submanifolds of the reduction lift to SLag submanifolds of M, invariant under
the torus action. If k=n-1 and the first cohomology of M is trivial, then we
prove that M is a fibration with generic fiber being a SLag submanifold. As an
application we will see that crepant resolutions of singularities of a finite
Abelian subgroup of SU(n) acting on C^n have SLag fibrations. We study SLag
submanifolds on the total space K(N) of a canonical bundle of a Kahler-Einstein
manifold N with positive scalar curvature. We give a conjecture about fibration
of K(N) by SLag subvarieties with a certain asymptotic behavior at infinity,
which we prove if N is toric. We also get similar results for coassociative
submanifolds of a G_2-manifold M^7, which admits a 3-torus, a 2-torus or an
SO(3)-action.
