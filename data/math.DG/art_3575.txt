Compact minimal surfaces in the Berger spheres
We construct compact arbitrary Euler characteristic orientable and
non-orientable minimal surfaces in the Berger spheres. Besides we show an
interesting family of surfaces that are minimal in every Berger sphere,
characterizing them by this property. Finally we construct, via the Daniel
correspondence, new examples of constant mean curvature surfaces in the
products S^2 x R, H^2 x R and in the Heisenberg group with many symmetries.
