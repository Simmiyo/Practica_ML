Uniqueness of warped product Einstein metrics and applications
We prove that complete warped product Einstein metrics with isometric bases,
simply connected space form fibers, and the same Ricci curvature and dimension
are isometric. In the compact case we also prove that the warping functions
must be the same up to scaling, while in the non-compact case there are simple
examples showing that the warping function is not unique. These results follow
from a structure theorem for warped product Einstein spaces which is proven by
applying the results in our earlier paper "Warped product rigidity" to a vector
space of virtual Einstein warping functions. We also use the structure theorem
to study gap phenomena for the dimension of the space of warping functions and
the isometry group of a warped product Einstein metric.
