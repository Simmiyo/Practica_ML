The Weierstrass Representation always gives a minimal surface
We give a simple, direct proof of the easy fact about the Weierstrass
Representation, namely, that it always gives a minimal surface. Most
presentations include the much harder converse that every simply connected
minimal surface is given by the Weierstrass Representation.
