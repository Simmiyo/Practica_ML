On the curvature properties of real time-like hypersurfaces of Kaehler
  manifolds with Norden metric
A type of almost contact hypersurfaces with Norden metric of a Kaehler
manifold with Norden metric is considered. The curvature tensor and the special
sectional curvatures are characterized. The canonical connection on such
manifolds is studied and the form of the corresponding Kaehler curvature tensor
is obtained. Some curvature properties of the manifolds belonging to the widest
integrable main class of the considered type of hypersurfaces are given.
