Special isothermic surfaces of type $d$
The special isothermic surfaces, discovered by Darboux in connection with
deformations of quadrics, admit a simple explanation via the gauge-theoretic
approach to isothermic surfaces. We find that they fit into a heirarchy of
special classes of isothermic surface and extend the theory to arbitrary
codimension.
