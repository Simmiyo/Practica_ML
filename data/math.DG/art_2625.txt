On parallel submanifolds of symmetric spaces
Due to its length and several inaccuracies, this article is no longer
suggested for reading. Moreover, in the meantime certain results presented
herein could be improved by the author in a non-trivial fashion.
  Instead, the reader is referred to the following two articles:
  The extrinsic holonomy Lie algebra of a parallel submanifold
(arXiv:0904.2611),
  Extrinsic homogeneity of parallel submanifolds (arXiv:0904.2636).
