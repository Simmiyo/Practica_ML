Compactness theorems of gradient Ricci solitons
In this paper, we prove the compactness theorem for gradient Ricci solitons.
Let $(M_{\alpha}, g_{\alpha})$ be a sequence of compact gradient Ricci solitons
of dimension $n\geq 4$, whose curvatures have uniformly bounded
$L^{\frac{n}{2}}$ norms, whose Ricci curvatures are uniformly bounded from
below with uniformly lower bounded volume and with uniformly upper bounded
diameter, then there must exists a subsequence $(M_{\alpha}, g_{\alpha})$
converging to a compact orbifold $(M_{\infty}, g_{\infty})$ with finitly many
isolated singularities, where $g_{\infty}$ is a gradient Ricci soliton metric
in an orbifold sense.
