Rigid 6-dimensional h-spaces of constant curvature
In this paper, we continue studying the 6-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian space
V^6(g_{ij}) with signature [++--], which admits projective motions, i. e.
continuous transformation groups preserving geodesics. In particular, we
determine a necessary and sufficient condition that the 6-dimensional rigid
h-spaces have constant curvature.
