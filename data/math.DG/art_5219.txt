Quasi-minimal Rotational Surfaces in Pseudo-Euclidean Four-dimensional
  Space
In the four-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean space with neutral metric there are
three types of rotational surfaces with two-dimensional axis - rotational
surfaces of elliptic, hyperbolic or parabolic type. A surface whose mean
curvature vector field is lightlike is said to be quasi-minimal. In this paper
we classify all quasi-minimal rotational surfaces of elliptic, hyperbolic and
parabolic type, respectively.
