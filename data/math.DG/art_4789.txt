On the classical and quantum momentum map
In this thesis we study the classical and quantum momentum maps and the
theory of reduction. We focus on the notion of momentum map in Poisson geometry
and we discuss the classification of the momentum map in this framework.
Furthermore, we describe the so-called Poisson Reduction, a technique that
allows us to reduce the dimension of a manifold in presence of symmetries
implemented by Poisson actions.
