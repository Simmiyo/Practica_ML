Twistor Forms on Riemannian Products
We study twistor forms on products of compact Riemannian manifolds and show
that they are defined by Killing forms on the factors. The main result of this
note is a necessary step in the classification of compact Riemannian manifolds
with non-generic holonomy carrying twistor forms.
