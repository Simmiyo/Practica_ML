Zeros of conformal fields in any metric signature
The connected components of the zero set of any conformal vector field, in a
pseudo-Riemannian manifold of arbitrary signature, are shown to be totally
umbilical conifold varieties, that is, smooth submanifolds except possibly for
some quadric singularities. The singularities occur only when the metric is
indefinite, including the Lorentzian case. This generalizes an analogous result
in the Riemannian case, due to Belgun, Moroianu and Ornea (2010).
