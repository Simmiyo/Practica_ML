Minimal surfaces with limit ends in H^2 x R
For any m > 0, we construct properly embedded minimal surfaces in H^2 x R
with genus zero, infinitely many vertical planar ends and m limit ends. We also
provide examples with an infinite countable number of limit ends. All these
examples are vertical bi-graphs.
