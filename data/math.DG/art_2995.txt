On the convex invariance in Finsler geometry
As a natural application of the {\it theory of geometric averaging} in
Finsler geometry and generalized Finsler geometry, a new approach to
investigate {\it generalized Finsler geometry}, based on a convex invariance of
the average structures, is introduced.
