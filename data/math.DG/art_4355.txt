Transgression to Loop Spaces and its Inverse, III: Gerbes and Thin
  Fusion Bundles
We show that the category of abelian gerbes over a smooth manifold is
equivalent to a certain category of principal bundles over the free loop space.
These principal bundles are equipped with fusion products and are equivariant
with respect to thin homotopies between loops. The equivalence is established
by a functor called regression, and complements a similar equivalence for
bundles and gerbes equipped with connections, derived previously in Part II of
this series of papers. The two equivalences provide a complete loop space
formulation of the geometry of gerbes; functorial, monoidal, natural in the
base manifold, and consistent with passing from the setting "with connections"
to the one "without connections". We discuss an application to lifting
problems, which provides in particular loop space formulations of spin
structures, complex spin structures, and spin connections.
