SO(3)-Structures on 8-manifolds
We study Riemannian 8-manifolds with an infinitesimal action of SO(3) by
which each tangent space breaks into irreducible spaces of dimensions 3 and 5.
The relationship with quaternionic, almost product- and PSU-geometry is
thoroughly explained using representation-theoretical arguments.
