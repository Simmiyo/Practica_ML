The first eigenvalue of the Dirac operator on locally reducible
  Riemannian manifolds
We prove a lower estimate for the first eigenvalue of the Dirac operator on a
compact locally reducible Riemannian spin manifold with positive scalar
curvature. We determine also the universal covers of the manifolds on which the
smallest possible eigenvalue is attained.
