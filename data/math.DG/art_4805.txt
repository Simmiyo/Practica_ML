Convex Spacelike Hypersurfaces of Constant Curvature in de Sitter Space
We show that for a very general and natural class of curvature functions (for
example the curvature quotients $(\sigma_n/\sigma_l)^{\frac{1}{n-l}}$) the
problem of finding a complete spacelike strictly convex hypersurface in de
Sitter space satisfying $f(\kappa) = \sigma \in (1,\infty)$ with a prescribed
compact future asymptotic boundary $\Gamma$ at infinity has at least one smooth
solution (if l = 1 or l = 2 there is uniqueness). This is the exact analogue of
the asymptotic plateau problem in Hyperbolic space and is in fact a precise
dual problem. By using this duality we obtain for free the existence of
strictly convex solutions to the asymptotic Plateau problem for $\sigma_l =
\sigma$; $1\leq l < n$ in both deSitter and Hyperbolic space.
