Surfaces in three-dimensional Lie groups in terms of spinors
This is a survey of results on surfaces in noncommutative three-dimensional
Lie groups obtained by using the Weierstrass (spinor) representation of
surfaces. It is based on the talk given at the conference "Geometry related to
the theory of integrable systems" (RIMS, Kyoto, September 2007).
