Geometric inequalities in Carnot groups
Let $\GG$ be a sub-Riemannian $k$-step Carnot group of homogeneous dimension
$Q$. In this paper, we shall prove several geometric inequalities concerning
smooth hypersurfaces (i.e. codimension one submanifolds) immersed in $\GG$,
endowed with the $\HH$-perimeter measure.
