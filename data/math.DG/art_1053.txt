Cohomologie $L^2$ et parabolicite
We obtain a topological interpretation for the space of $L^2$ harmonic forms
for some complete Riemannian manifold : when the geometry at infinity is the
geometry of a simply connected nilpotent Lie group, when the geometry at
infinity is a symmetric space with non positive curvature and also when the
geometry at infinity is parabolic.
