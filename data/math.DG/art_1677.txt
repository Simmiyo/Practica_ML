Induced structures on submanifolds in almost product Riemannian
  manifolds
We give some fundamental properties of the induced structures on submanifolds
immersed in almost product or locally product Riemannian manifolds. We study
the induced structure by the composition of two isometric immersions on
submanifolds in an almost product Riemannian manifold. We give an effective
construction for some induced structures on submanifolds of codimension 1 or 2
in Euclidean space.
