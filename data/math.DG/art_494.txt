$T^3$-fibrations on compact six-manifolds
We describe a simple way of constructing torus fibrations $T^3\to X\to S^3$
which degenerate canonically over a knot or link in $S^3$. We show that the
topological invariants of $X$ can be computed algebraically from the monodromy
representation of the fibration. We use this to obtain some new
$T^3$-fibrations $S^3\times S^3\to S^3$ and $(S^3\times S^3)#(S^3\times
S^3)#(S^4\times S^2) \to S^3$ whose discriminant locus is a torus knot.
