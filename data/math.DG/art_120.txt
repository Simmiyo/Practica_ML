On conformal invariance of isotropic geodesics
We consider real isotropic geodesics on manifolds endowed with a
pseudoconformal structure and their applications to the theory of lightlike
hypersurfaces on such manifolds, the geometry of four-dimensional conformal
structures of Lorentzian type, and a classification of the Einstein spaces.
