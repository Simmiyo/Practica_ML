Limit leaves of a CMC lamination are stable
Suppose ${\cal L}$ is a lamination of a Riemannian manifold by hypersurfaces
with the same constant mean curvature. We prove that every limit leaf of ${\cal
L}$ is stable for the Jacobi operator. A simple but important consequence of
this result is that the set of stable leaves of ${\cal L}$ has the structure of
a lamination.
