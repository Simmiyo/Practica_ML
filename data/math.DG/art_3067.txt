The Weierstrass representation of discrete isotropic surfaces in
  $R^{2,1}$, $R^{3,1}$ and $R^{2,2}$
Using an integrable discrete Dirac operator, we construct a discrete version
of the Weierstrass representation of time-like surfaces parametrized along
isotropic directions in $R^{2,1}$, $R^{3,1}$ and $R^{2,2}$. The corresponding
discrete surfaces have isotropic edges. We show that any discrete surface
satisfying a general monotonicity condition and having isotropic edges admits
such a representation.
