Complete commutative subalgebras in polynomial Poisson algebras: a proof
  of the Mischenko--Fomenko conjecture
The Mishchenko-Fomenko conjecture says that for each real or complex
finite-dimensional Lie algebra $\goth g$ there exists a complete set of
commuting polynomials on its dual space $\goth g^*$. In terms of the theory of
integrable Hamiltonian systems this means that the dual space $\goth g^*$
endowed with the standard Lie-Poisson bracket admits polynomial integrable
Hamiltonian systems. Recently this conjecture has been proved by S.T. Sadetov.
Following his idea, we give an explicit geometric construction for commuting
polynomials on $\goth g^*$ and consider some examples.
