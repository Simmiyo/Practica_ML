The second Dirac eigenvalue of a nearly parallel $G_2$-manifold
We investigate the second Dirac eigenvalue on Riemannian manifolds admitting
a Killing spinor. In small dimensions the whole Dirac spectrum depends on
special eigenvalues on functions and 1-forms. We compute and discuss the
formulas in dimension $n = 7$.
