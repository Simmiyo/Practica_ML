Projective generalizations of Lelieuvre's formula
Generalizations of the classical affine Lelieuvre formula to surfaces in
projective three-dimensional space and to hypersurfaces in multi- dimensional
projective space are given. A discrete version of the projective Lelieuvre
formula is presented too.
