Ruled Lagrangian Submanifolds of the 6-Sphere
This article sets out to serve a dual purpose. On the one hand, we give an
explicit description of the Lagrangian submanifolds of the nearly Kaehler
6-sphere which are ruled by circles of constant radius using Weierstrass
formulae. On the other, we recognise all previous known examples of these
Lagrangians as being ruled by such circles. Therefore, we describe all families
of Lagrangians in the 6-sphere whose second fundamental form satisfies natural
pointwise conditions: so-called second order families.
