Relations between the Kahler cone and the balanced cone of a Kahler
  manifold
In this paper, we consider a natural map from the Kahler cone to the balanced
cone of a Kahler manifold. We study its injectivity and surjecticity. We also
give an analytic characterization theorem on a nef class being Kahler.
