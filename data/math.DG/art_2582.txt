Geometry of minimal energy Yang-Mills connections
We study the converse to the statement that instantons are minimizers of the
Yang--Mills energy in four dimensions. We show that given an energy minimizing
connection, A, the curvature of A takes values in a subbundle of the adjoint
bundle which decomposes as a sum of instantons.
