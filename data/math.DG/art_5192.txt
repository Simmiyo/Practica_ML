Positive biorthogonal curvature on S^2 x S^2
We prove that S^2 x S^2 satisfies an intermediate condition between having
metrics with positive Ricci and positive sectional curvature. Namely, there
exist metrics for which the average of the sectional curvatures of any two
planes tangent at the same point, but separated by a minimum distance in the
2-Grassmannian, is strictly positive; and this can be done with an arbitrarily
small lower bound on the distance between the planes considered. Although they
have positive Ricci curvature, these metrics do not have nonnegative sectional
curvature. Such metrics also have positive biorthogonal curvature, meaning that
the average of sectional curvatures of any two orthogonal planes is positive.
