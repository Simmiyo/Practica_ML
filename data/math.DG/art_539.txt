A fully nonlinear conformal flow on locally conformally flat manifolds
We study a fully nonlinear flow for conformal metrics. The long-time
existence and the sequential convergence of flow are established for locally
conformally flat manifolds. As an application, we solve the $\sk$-Yamabe
problem for locally conformal flat manifolds when $k \neq n/2$.
