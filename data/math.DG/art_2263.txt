Equivariant relative Thom forms and Chern characters
These notes are the first chapter of a monograph, dedicated to a detailed
proof of the equivariant index theorem for transversally elliptic operators. In
this preliminary chapter, we prove a certain number of natural relations in
equivariant cohomology. These relations include the Thom isomorphism in
equivariant cohomology, the multiplicativity of the relative Chern characters,
and the Riemann-Roch relation between the relative Chern character of the Bott
symbol and of the relative Thom class.
