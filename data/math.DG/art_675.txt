Eta forms and the Chern Character
We prove two geometric index theorems for a family of first-order elliptic
operators over a manifold with boundary by computing eta form representatives
for the Chern character classes of the index bundle. The eta forms occur as
relative and regularized traces on infinite-dimensional vector bundles realized
as the limiting values of superconnection character forms.
