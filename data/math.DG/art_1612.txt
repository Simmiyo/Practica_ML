Surgery and Harmonic Spinors
Let M be a compact manifold with a fixed spin structure \chi. The
Atiyah-Singer index theorem implies that for any metric g on M the dimension of
the kernel of the Dirac operator is bounded from below by a topological
quantity depending only on M and \chi. We show that for generic metrics on M
this bound is attained.
