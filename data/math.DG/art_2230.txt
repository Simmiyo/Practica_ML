Degenerate complex Monge-Ampère equations over compact Kähler
  manifolds
We prove the existence and uniqueness of the solutions of some very general
type of degenerate complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations. This type of equations is
precisely what is needed in order to construct K\"ahler-Einstein metrics over
irreducible singular K\"ahler spaces with ample or trivial canonical sheaf and
singular K\"ahler-Einstein metrics over varieties of general type.
