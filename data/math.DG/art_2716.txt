The Frolicher-Nijenhuis Calculus in Synthetic Differential Geometry
Just as the Jacobi identity of vector fields is a natural consequence of the
general Jacobi identity of microcubes in synthetic differential geometry, it is
to be shown in this paper that the graded Jacobi identity of the
Frolicher-Nijenhuis bracket is also a natural consequence of the general Jacobi
identity.
