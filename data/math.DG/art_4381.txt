On the projective algebra of Einstein Matsumoto metrics
The projective algebra p(M;F) (i.e the collection of all projective vector
fields)of a Finsler space (M;F) is a finite-dimensional Lie algebra with
respect to the usual Lie bracket. The projective algebra of Einstein metrics
has been perpetually studied from physical and geometrical approaches. Here,
the projective algebra of Einstein Matsumoto space of dimension n \geq 3 is
characterized. Moreover, Einstein Matsumoto metrics with maximum projective
symmetry are studied and characterized.
