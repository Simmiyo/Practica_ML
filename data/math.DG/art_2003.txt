Deformations of generalized complex and generalized Kahler structures
In this paper we obtain a stability theorem of generalized Kahler structures
with one pure spinor under small deformations of generalized complex
structures. (This is analogous to the stability theorem of Kahler manifolds by
Kodaira-Spencer.) We apply the stability theorem to a class of compact Kahler
manifolds which admits deformations to generalized complex manifolds and obtain
non-trivial generalized Kahler structures on Fano surfaces and toric Kahler
manifolds. In particular, we show that holomorphic Poisson structures on a
Kahler manifold induce deformations of generalized Kahler structures.
