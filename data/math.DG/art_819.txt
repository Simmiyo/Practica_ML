A Fourier-Mukai transform for real torus bundles
We construct a Fourier--Mukai transform for smooth complex vector bundles $E$
over a torus bundle $\pi:M \to B,$ the vector bundles being endowed with
various structures of increasing complexity. At a minimum, we consider vector
bundles $E$ with a flat partial unitary connection, that is families or
deformations of flat vector bundles (or unitary local systems) on the torus
$T.$ This leads to a correspondence between such objects on $M$ and relative
skyscraper sheaves $\cS$ supported on a spectral covering $\Sigma \hra \what
M,$ where $\hat\pi:\what{M} \to B$ is the flat dual fiber bundle. Additional
structures on $(E,\nabla)$ (flatness, anti-self-duality) will be reflected by
corresponding data on the transform $(\cS, \Sigma).$ Several variations of this
construction will be presented, emphasizing the aspects of foliation theory
which enter into this picture
