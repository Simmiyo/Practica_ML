Generalized geometry and the Hodge decomposition
In this lecture, we review some of the concepts of generalized geometry, as
introduced by Hitchin and developed in the speaker's thesis. We also prove a
Hodge decomposition for the twisted cohomology of a compact generalized
K\"ahler manifold, as well as a generalization of the $dd^c$-lemma of K\"ahler
geometry.
