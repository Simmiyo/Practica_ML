The Schwarzian derivative and measured laminations on Riemann surfaces
We compare two relationships between quadratic differentials and measured
geodesic laminations on hyperbolic Riemann surfaces (by foliations or complex
projective structures). Each yields a homeomorphism $\ML(S) \to Q(X)$ for any
conformal structure $X$ on a compact surface $S$. The main result is that these
maps are nearly the same, differing by a multiplicative factor of -2 and an
error term of lower order than the maps themselves (which we bound explicitly).
  As an application we show that the Schwarzian derivative of a $\CP^1$
structure with Fuchsian holonomy is close to a $2\pi$-integral Jenkins-Strebel
differential. We also study compactifications of the space of $\CP^1$
structures using the Schwarzian derivative and grafting coordinates; we show
that the natural map between these extends to the boundary of each fiber over
Teichmuller space, and we describe this extension.
