4-dimensional (para)-Kähler--Weyl structures
We give an elementary proof of the fact that any 4-dimensional para-Hermitian
manifold admits a unique para-Kaehler--Weyl structure. We then use analytic
continuation to pass from the para-complex to the complex setting and thereby
show any 4-dimensional pseudo-Hermitian manifold also admits a unique
Kaehler--Weyl structure.
