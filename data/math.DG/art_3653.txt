CMC-1 trinoids in hyperbolic 3-space and metrics of constant curvature
  one with conical singularities on the 2-sphere
CMC-1 trinoids (i.e. constant mean curvature one immersed surface with three
regular embedded ends) in hyperbolic 3-space H^3 are irreducible generically,
and the irreducible ones have been classified. However, the reducible case has
not yet been fully treated, so in this paper we give an explicit description of
CMC-1 trinoids in H^3 that includes the reducible case.
