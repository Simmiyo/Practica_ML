Discrete surfaces of constant mean curvature
We propose a unified definition for discrete analogues of constant mean
curvature surfaces in spaces of constant curvature as a special case of
discrete special isothermic nets. B\"acklund transformations and Lawson's
correspondence are discussed. It is shown that the definition generalizes
previous definitions and a construction for discrete cmc surfaces of revolution
in space forms is provided.
