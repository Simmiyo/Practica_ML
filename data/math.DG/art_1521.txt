Lagrangian surfaces in complex Euclidean plane via spherical and
  hyperbolic curves
We present a method to construct a large family of Lagrangian surfaces in
complex Euclidean plane by using Legendre curves in the 3-sphere and in the
anti de Sitter 3-space or, equivalently, by using spherical and hyperbolic
curves, respectively. Among this family, we characterize minimal, constant mean
curvature, Hamiltonian-minimal and Willmore surfaces in terms of simple
properties of the curvature of the generating curves. As applications, we
provide explicitly conformal parametrizations of known and new examples of
minimal, constant mean curvature, Hamiltonian-minimal and Willmore surfaces in
complex Euclidean plane.
