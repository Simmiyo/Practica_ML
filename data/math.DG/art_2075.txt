The Gauss-Bonnet-Grotemeyer Theorem in spaces of constant curvature
In 1963, K.P.Grotemeyer proved an interesting variant of the Gauss-Bonnet
Theorem. Let M be an oriented closed surface in the Euclidean space R^3 with
Euler characteristic \chi(M), Gauss curvature G and unit normal vector field n.
Grotemeyer's identity replaces the Gauss-Bonnet integrand G by the normal
moment <a,n>^2G, where $a$ is a fixed unit vector. Grotemeyer showed that the
total integral of this integrand is (2/3)pi times chi(M).
  We generalize Grotemeyer's result to oriented closed even-dimesional
hypersurfaces of dimension n in an (n+1) ndimensional space form N^{n+1}(k).
