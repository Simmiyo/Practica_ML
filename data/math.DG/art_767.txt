The complex-symplectic geometry of SL(2,C)-characters over surfaces
The SL(2)-character variety X of a closed surface M enjoys a natural
complex-symplectic structure invariant under the mapping class group G of M.
Using the ergodicity of G on the SU(2)-character variety, we deduce that every
G-invariant meromorphic function on X is constant. The trace functions of
closed curves on M determine regular functions which generate complex
Hamiltonian flows. For simple closed curves, these complex Hamiltonian flows
arise from holomorphic flows on the representation variety generalizing the
Fenchel-Nielsen twist flows on Teichmueller space and the complex quakebend
flows on quasi-Fuchsian space. Closed curves in the complex trajectories of
these flows lift to paths in the deformation space of complex-projective
structures between different projective structures with the same holonomy
(grafting). A pants decomposition determines a holomorphic completely
integrable system on X. This integrable system is related to the complex
Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates on quasi-Fuchsian space developed by Tan and
Kourouniotis, and relate to recent formulas of Platis and Series on
complex-length functions and complex twist flows.
