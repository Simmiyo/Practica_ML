On the Four Vertex Theorem on planes with radial density $e^{φ(r)}$
It is showed that on a plane with a radial density the Four Vertex Theorem
holds for the class of all simple closed curves if and only if the density is
constant. But for the class of simple closed curves that are invariant under a
rotation about the origin, the Four Vertex Theorem holds for every radial
density.
