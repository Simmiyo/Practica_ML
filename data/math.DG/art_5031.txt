Multiply twisted products
In this paper, we compute the index form of the multiply twisted products. We
study the Killing vector fields on the multiply twisted product manifolds and
determine the Killing vector fields in some cases. We compute the curvature of
the multiply twisted products with a semi-symmetric metric connection and show
that the mixed Ricci-flat multiply twisted products with a semi-symmetric
metric connection can be expressed as multiply warped products. We also study
the Einstein multiply warped products with a semi-symmetric metric connection
and the multiply warped products with a semi-symmetric metric connection with
constant scalar curvature, we apply our results to generalized Robertson-Walker
spacetimes with a semi-symmetric metric connection and generalized Kasner
spacetimes with a semi-symmetric metric connection and find some new examples
of Einstein affine manifolds and affine manifolds with constant scalar
curvature. We also consider the multiply twisted product Finsler manifolds and
we get some interesting properties of these spaces.
