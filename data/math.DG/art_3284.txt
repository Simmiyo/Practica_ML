Higher symmetries of the conformal powers of the Laplacian on
  conformally flat manifolds
On locally conformally flat manifolds we describe a construction which maps
generalised conformal Killing tensors to differential operators which may act
on any conformally weighted tensor bundle; the operators in the range have the
property that they are symmetries of any natural conformally invariant
differential operator between such bundles. These are used to construct all
symmetries of the conformally invariant powers of the Laplacian (often called
the GJMS operators) on manifolds of dimension at least 3. In particular this
yields all symmetries of the powers of the Laplacian $\Delta^k$, $k\in
\mathbb{Z}>0$, on Euclidean space $\mathbb{E}^n$. The algebra formed by the
symmetry operators is described explicitly.
