Conformal geometry and special holonomy
A theorem of Lawson and Simons states that the only stable minimal
submanifolds in complex projective spaces are complex submanifolds. We
generalize their result to the cases of quaternionic and octonionic projective
spaces. Our approach gives a unified viewpoint towards conformal and projective
geometries.
