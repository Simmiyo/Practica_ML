On the Kähler-Ricci flow near a Kähler-Einstein metric
On a Fano manifold, we prove that the Kahler-Ricci flow starting from a
Kahler metric in the anti-canonical class which is sufficiently close to a
Kahler-Einstein metric must converge in a polynomial rate to a Kahler-Einstein
metric. The convergence can not happen in general if we study the flow on the
level of Kahler potentials. Instead we exploit the interpretation of the Ricci
flow as the gradient flow of Perelman's \mu functional. This involves modifying
the Ricci flow by a canonical family of gauges. In particular, the complex
structure of the limit could be different in general. The main technical
ingredient is a Lojasiewicz type inequality for Perelman's \mu functional near
a critical point.
