Constant Angle Surfaces in $\mathbb{S}^3(1) \times \mathbb{R}$
In this article we study surfaces in $\mathbb{S}^3(1) \times \mathbb{R}$ for
which the $\mathbb{R}$-direction makes a constant angle with the normal plane.
We give a complete classification for such surfaces with parallel mean
curvature vector.
