A sharp bound for the area of minimal surfaces in the unit ball
Let \Sigma be a k-dimensional minimal surface in the unit ball B^n which
meets the unit sphere orthogonally. We show that the area of \Sigma is bounded
from below by the volume of the unit ball in R^k. This answers a question posed
by R. Schoen.
