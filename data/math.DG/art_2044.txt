The Ricci iteration and its applications
In this Note we introduce and study dynamical systems related to the Ricci
operator on the space of Kahler metrics as discretizations of certain geometric
flows. We pose a conjecture on their convergence towards canonical Kahler
metrics and study the case where the first Chern class is negative, zero or
positive. This construction has several applications in Kahler geometry, among
them an answer to a question of Nadel and a construction of multiplier ideal
sheaves.
