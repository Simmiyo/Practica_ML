Screen bundles of Lorentzian manifolds and some generalisations of
  pp-waves
A pp-wave is a Lorentzian manifold with a parallel light-like vector field
satisfying a certain curvature condition. We introduce generalisations of
pp-waves, on one hand by allowing the vector field to be recurrent and on the
other hand by weakening the curvature condition. These generalisations are
related to the screen holonomy of the Lorentzian manifold. While pp-waves have
a trivial screen holonomy there are no restrictions on the screen holonomy of
the manifolds with the weaker curvature condition.
