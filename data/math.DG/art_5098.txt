Maximum principle for semi-elliptic trace operators and geometric
  applications
Based on ideas of L. Al\'ias, D. Impera and M. Rigoli developed in
"Hypersurfaces of constant higher order mean curvature in warped products", we
develope a fairly general weak/Omori-Yau maximum principle for trace operators.
We apply this version of maximum principle to generalize several higher order
mean curvature estimates and to give an extension of Alias-Impera-Rigoli Slice
