A Kaehler Einstein structure on the nonzero cotangent bundle of a space
  form
We obtain a Kaehler Einstein structure on the nonzero cotangent bundle of a
Riemannian manifold of positive constant sectional curvature. The obtained
Kaehler Einstein structure cannot have constant holomorphic sectional curvature
and is not locally symmetric.
