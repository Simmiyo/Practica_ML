Flows of constant mean curvature tori in the 3-sphere: The equivariant
  case
We present a deformation for constant mean curvature tori in the 3-sphere. We
show that the moduli space of equivariant constant mean curvature tori in the
3-sphere is connected, and we classify the minimal, the embedded, and the
Alexandrov embedded tori therein. We conclude with an instability result.
