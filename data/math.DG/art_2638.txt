The co-Riemannian Structure of Smooth Loop Spaces
We construct a natural co-Riemannian structure on the manifold of smooth
loops in a Riemannian manifold. We show that the smooth loop space of a string
manifold is a per-Hilbert-Schmidt locally equivalent co-spin manifold and thus
admits a Dirac operator.
