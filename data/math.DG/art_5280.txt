On the isometric deformation of surfaces via the Bäcklund
  transformation
In trying to generalize Bianchi's B\"acklund transformation of quadrics to
B\"acklund transformations of isometric deformations of other (classes of)
surfaces, we investigate basic features of the isometric deformation of
surfaces via the B\"acklund transformation with isometric correspondence of
leaves of a general nature (independent of the shape of the seed).
