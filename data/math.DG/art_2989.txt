On analytic descriptions of two-dimensional surfaces associated with the
  CP^(N-1) sigma model
We study analytic descriptions of conformal immersions of the Riemann sphere
S^2 into the CP^(N-1) sigma model. In particular, an explicit expression for
two-dimensional (2-D) surfaces, obtained from the generalized Weierstrass
formula, is given. It is also demonstrated that these surfaces coincide with
the ones obtained from the Sym-Tafel formula. These two approaches correspond
to parametrizations of one and the same surface in R^(N^2-1).
