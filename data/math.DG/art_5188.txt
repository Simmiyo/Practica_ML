Axiomatic Differential Geometry III-2
Given a complete and (locally) cartesian closed category U, it is shown that
the category of functors from the category of Weil algebras to the category U
is (locally, resp.) cartesian closed. The corresponding axiomatization for
differential geometry based upon Weil functors is then given.
