Surgery, Yamabe invariant, and Seiberg-Witten theory
By using the gluing formula of the Seiberg-Witten invariant, we compute the
Yamabe invariant Y(X) of 4-manifolds X obtained by performing surgeries along
points, circles or tori on compact Kaehler surfaces. For instance, if M is a
compact Kaehler surface of nonnegative Kodaira dimension, and N is a smooth
closed oriented 4-manifold with b_2^+(N)=0 and Y(N)>= 0, then we show that Y(M
# N)=Y(M).
