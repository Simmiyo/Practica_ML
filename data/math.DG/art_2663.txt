The Existence of Soliton Metrics for Nilpotent Lie Groups
We show that a left-invariant metric g on a nilpotent Lie group N is a
soliton metric if and only if a matrix U and vector v associated the manifold
(N,g) satisfy the matrix equation Uv = [1], where [1] is a vector with every
entry a one. We associate a generalized Cartan matrix to the matrix U and use
the theory of Kac-Moody algebras to analyze the solution spaces for such linear
systems. We use these methods to find infinitely many new examples of
nilmanifolds with soliton metrics. We give a sufficient condition for a sum of
soliton metric nilpotent Lie algebra structures to be soliton, and we use this
criterion to show that soliton metrics exist on every naturally graded filiform
metric Lie algebra.
