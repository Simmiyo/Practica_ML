Normal CR structures on compact 3-manifolds
We study normal CR compact manifolds in dimension 3. For a choice of a CR
Reeb vector field, we associate a Sasakian metric on them, and we classify
those metrics. As a consequence, the underlying manifolds are topologically
finite quotiens of the 3-sphere or of a circle bundle over a Riemann surface of
positive genus. In the latter case, we prove that their CR automorphisms group
is a finite extension of U(1), and we classify the normal CR structures on
these manifolds.
