An optimal extension of Perelman's comparison theorem for quadrangles
  and its applications
In this paper we discuss an extension of Perelman's comparison for
quadrangles. Among applications of this new comparison theorem, we study the
equidistance evolution of hypersurfaces in Alexandrov spaces with non-negative
curvature. We show that, in certain cases, the equidistance evolution of
hypersurfaces become totally convex relative to a bigger sub-domain. An optimal
extension of 2nd variational formula for geodesics by Petrunin will be derived
for the case of non-negative curvature.
  In addition, we also introduced the generalized second fundament forms for
subsets in Alexandrov spaces. Using this new notion, we will propose an
approach to study two open problems in Alexandrov geometry.
