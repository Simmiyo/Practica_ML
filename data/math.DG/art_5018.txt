A note on jet and geometric approach to higher order connections
We compare two ways of interpreting higher order connections. The geometric
approach lies in the decomposition of higher order tangent space into the
horizontal and vertical structures while the jet--like approach considers a
higher order connection as the section of a jet prolongation of a fibered
manifold. Particularly, we use the Ehresmann prolongation of a general
connection and study the result from the point of view of geometric theory. We
pay attention to linear connections, too.
