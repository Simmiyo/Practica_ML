A Schwarz lemma for Kähler affine metrics and the canonical potential
  of a proper convex cone
This is an account of some aspects of the geometry of K\"ahler affine metrics
based on considering them as smooth metric measure spaces and applying the
comparison geometry of Bakry-Emery Ricci tensors. Such techniques yield a
version for K\"ahler affine metrics of Yau's Schwarz lemma for volume forms. By
a theorem of Cheng and Yau there is a canonical K\"ahler affine Einstein metric
on a proper convex domain, and the Schwarz lemma gives a direct proof of its
uniqueness up to homothety. The potential for this metric is a function
canonically associated to the cone, characterized by the property that its
level sets are hyperbolic affine spheres foliating the cone. It is shown that
for an $n$-dimensional cone a rescaling of the canonical potential is an
$n$-normal barrier function in the sense of interior point methods for conic
programming. It is explained also how to construct from the canonical potential
Monge-Amp\`ere metrics of both Riemannian and Lorentzian signatures, and a mean
curvature zero conical Lagrangian submanifold of the flat para-K\"ahler space.
