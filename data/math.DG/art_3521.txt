Slant submersions from almost Hermitian manifolds
We introduce slant submersions from almost Hermitian manifolds onto
Riemannian manifolds. We give examples, investigate the geometry of foliations
which are arisen from the definition of a Riemannian submersion and check the
harmonicity of such submersions. We also find necessary and sufficient
conditions for a slant submersion to be totally geodesic. Moreover, we obtain a
decomposition theorem for the total manifold of such submersions.
