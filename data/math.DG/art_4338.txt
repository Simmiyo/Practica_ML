Backlund Transformations for Darboux Integrable Differential Systems
We give a new mechanism for constructing Backlund transformations by using
symmetry reduction of differential systems. We then characterize a family of
Backlund transformations between Darboux integrable systems where the Backlund
transformation can be constructed by the proposed symmetry reduction method.
