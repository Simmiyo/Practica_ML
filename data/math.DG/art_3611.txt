Naturally reductive pseudo-Riemannian spaces
A family of naturally reductive pseudo-Riemannian spaces is constructed out
of the representations of Lie algebras with ad-invariant metrics. We exhibit
peculiar examples, study their geometry and characterize the corresponding
naturally reductive homogeneous structure.
