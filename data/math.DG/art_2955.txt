A local estimate for maximal surfaces in Lorentzian product spaces
In this paper we introduce a local approach for the study of maximal surfaces
immersed into a Lorentzian product space of the form $M^2\times R_1$, where
$M^2$ is a connected Riemannian surface and $M^2\times R_1$ is endowed with the
product Lorentzian metric. Specifically, we establish a local integral
inequality for the squared norm of the second fundamental form of the surface,
which allows us to derive an alternative proof of our Calabi-Bernstein theorem
given in \cite{AA}.
