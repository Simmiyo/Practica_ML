Mean Curvature Flow of Higher Codimension in Hyperbolic Spaces
In this paper we investigate the convergence for the mean curvature flow of
closed submanifolds with arbitrary codimension in space forms. Particularly, we
prove that the mean curvature flow deforms a closed submanifold satisfying a
pinching condition in a hyperbolic space form to a round point in finite time.
