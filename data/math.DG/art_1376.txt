On the decomposition of global conformal invariants II
This paper is a continuation of [2], where we complete our partial proof of
the Deser-Schwimmer conjecture on the structure of ``global conformal
invariants''. Our theorem deals with such invariants P(g^n) that locally depend
only on the curvature tensor R_{ijkl} (without covariant derivatives).
  In [2] we developed a powerful tool, the ``super divergence formula'' which
applies to any Riemannian operator that always integrates to zero on compact
manifolds. In particular, it applies to the operator I_{g^n}(\phi) that
measures the ``non-conformally invariant part'' of P(g^n). This paper resolves
the problem of using this information we have obtained on the structure of
I_{g^n}(\phi) to understand the structure of P(g^n).
