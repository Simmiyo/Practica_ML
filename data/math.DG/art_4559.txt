Almost Lie structures on an anchored Banach bundle
Under appropriate assumptions, we generalize the concept of linear almost
Poisson struc- tures, almost Lie algebroids, almost differentials in the
framework of Banach anchored bundles and the relation between these objects. We
then obtain an adapted formalism for mechanical systems which is illustrated by
the evolutionary problem of the "Hilbert snake"
