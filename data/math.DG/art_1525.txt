Extrinsic radius pinching for hypersurfaces of space forms
We prove some pinching results for the extrinsic radius of compact
hypersurfaces in space forms. We show that if the pinching condion is strong
enough with a dependance on the norm of the second foundamental form, then the
hypersurface is diffeomorphic and almost isometric to a geodesic hypersphere.
