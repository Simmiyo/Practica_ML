Jacobi fields along harmonic 2-spheres in ${\bf C}P^2$ are integrable
We show that any Jacobi field along a harmonic map from the 2-sphere to the
complex projective plane is integrable (i.e., is tangent to a smooth variation
through harmonic maps). This provides one of the few known answers to this
problem of integrability, which was raised in different contexts of geometry
and analysis. It implies that the Jacobi fields form the tangent bundle to each
component of the manifold of harmonic maps from $S^2$ to ${\bf C}P^2$ thus
giving the nullity of any such harmonic map; it also has bearing on the
behaviour of weakly harmonic $E$-minimizing maps from a 3-manifold to ${\bf
C}P^2$ near a singularity and the structure of the singular set of such maps
from any manifold to ${\bf C}P^2$.
