A note on the Ricci flow on noncompact manifolds
Let $(M^3,g_0)$ be a complete noncompact Riemannian 3-manifold with
nonnegative Ricci curvature and with injectivity radius bounded away from zero.
Suppose that the scalar curvature $R(x)\to 0$ as $x\to \infty$. Then the Ricci
flow with initial data $(M^3,g_0)$ has a long time solution. This extends a
recent result of Ma and Zhu. We also have a higher dimensional version, and we
reprove a K$\ddot{a}$hler analogy due to Chau, Tam and Yu.
