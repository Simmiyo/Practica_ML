Interactions between para-quaternionic and Grassmannian geometry
Almost para-quaternionic structures on smooth manifolds of dimension $2n$ are
equivalent to almost Grassmannian structures of type $(2,n)$. We remind the
equivalence and exhibit some interrelations between subjects that were
previously studied independently from the para-quaternionic and the
Grassmannian point of view. In particular, we relate the respective
normalization conditions, distinguished curves and twistor constructions.
