Sphere-foliated minimal and constant mean curvature hypersurfaces in
  product spaces
In this paper, we prove that minimal hypersurfaces when $n\geq 3$ and nonzero
constant mean curvature hypersurfaces when $n\geq2$ foliated by spheres in
parallel horizontal hyperplanes in ${\mathbb{H}}^n \times \mathbb{R}$ must be
rotationally symmetric.
