Minimax problems related to cup powers and Steenrod squares
If F is a family of mod 2 flat k-cycles in the unit n-ball, we lower bound
the maximal volume of any cycle in F in terms of the homology class of F in the
space of all cycles. We give examples to show that these lower bounds are
fairly sharp.
