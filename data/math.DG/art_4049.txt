Classification of constant angle hypersurfaces in warped products via
  eikonal functions
Given a warped product of the real line with a Riemannian manifold of
arbitrary dimension, we classify the hypersurfaces whose tangent spaces make a
constant angle with the vector field tangent to the real direction. We show
that this is a natural setting in which to extend previous results in this
direction made by several authors. Moreover, when the constant angle
hypersurface is a graph over the Riemannian manifold, we show that the function
involved satisfies a generalized eikonal equation, which we solve via a
geometric method. In the final part of this paper we prove that minimal
constant angle hypersurfaces are cylinders over minimal submanifolds.
