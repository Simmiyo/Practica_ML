Parallel Transport Frame in 4-dimensional Euclidean Space
In this work, we give parallel transport frame of a curve and we introduce
the relations between the frame and Frenet frame of the curve in 4-dimensional
Euclidean space. The relation which is well known in Euclidean 3-space is
generalized for the first time in 4-dimensional Euclidean space. Then we obtain
the condition for spherical curves using the parallel transport frame of them.
The condition in terms of \kappa and {\tau} is so complicated but in terms of
k_{1} and k_{2} is simple. So, parallel transport frame is important to make
easy some complicated characterizations. Moreover, we characterize curves whose
position vectors lie in their normal, rectifying and osculating planes in
4-dimensional Euclidean space E^{4}.
