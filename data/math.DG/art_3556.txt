A classification of certain almost $α$-Kenmotsu manifolds
We study $\mathcal D$-homothetic deformations of almost $\alpha$-Kenmotsu
structures. We characterize almost contact metric manifolds which are
$CR$-integrable almost $\alpha$-Kenmotsu manifolds, through the existence of a
canonical linear connection, invariant under $\mathcal D$-homothetic
deformations. If the canonical connection associated to the structure
$(\varphi,\xi,\eta,g)$ has parallel torsion and curvature, then the local
geometry is completely determined by the dimension of the manifold and the
spectrum of the operator $h'$ defined by $2\alpha h'=({\mathcal
L}_\xi\varphi)\circ\varphi$. In particular, the manifold is locally equivalent
to a Lie group endowed with a left invariant almost $\alpha$-Kenmotsu
structure. In the case of almost $\alpha$-Kenmotsu $(\kappa,\mu)'$-spaces, this
classification gives rise to a scalar invariant depending on the real numbers
$\kappa$ and $\alpha$.
