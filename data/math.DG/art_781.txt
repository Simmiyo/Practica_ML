Twistorial harmonic morphisms with one-dimensional fibres on self-dual
  four-manifolds
We introduce a general notion of twistorial map and classify twistorial
harmonic morphisms with one-dimensional fibres from self-dual four-manifolds.
Such maps can be characterised as those which pull back Abelian monopoles to
self-dual connections. In fact, the constructions involve solving a generalised
monopole equation, and also the Beltrami fields equation of hydrodynamics, and
lead to constructions of self-dual metrics.
