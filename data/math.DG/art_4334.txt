Schur's Theorem for Almost Hermitian Manifolds
The Schur's theorem of antiholomorphic type is proved for arbitrary almost
Hermitian manifolds, namely: If a connected almost Hermitian manifold of
dimension greater or equal to 6 is of pointwise constant antiholomorphic
sectional curvature, then this curvature is a global constant.
