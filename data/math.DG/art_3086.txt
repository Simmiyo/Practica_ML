Smooth compactness of self-shrinkers
We prove a smooth compactness theorem for the space of embedded
self-shrinkers in $\RR^3$. Since self-shrinkers model singularities in mean
curvature flow, this theorem can be thought of as a compactness result for the
space of all singularities and it plays an important role in studying generic
mean curvature flow.
