Bifurcation of constant mean curvature tori in Euclidean spheres
We use bifurcation theory to show the existence of infinite sequences
isometric embeddings of tori with constant mean curvature (CMC) in Euclidean
spheres that are not isometrically congruent to the CMC Clifford tori, and
accumulating at some CMC Clifford torus.
