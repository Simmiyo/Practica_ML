A condition to prescribe Mean Curvature Equations
Let (B^n, g) the $n-$dimensional Ball. In this paper we show the existence of
a solution to the prescribing mean curvature equation:
  In the case $h$ is rotationally symetric, is well known that the
Kazdan-Warner condition implies that a necesary condition for $\eqref{main}$ to
have a solution is: h>0 \text{somewhere and}h'(r) \text{change signs}
  This condition was improved to: {eqnarray}\label{dos} h'(r) \text{changes
signs where} h>0 {eqnarray} However, is this a sufficient condition?. In this
paper we prove that if $h(r)$ satisfies a flatness condition and is radially
symmetric then $\eqref{dos}$ is the necessary and suficient condition to have a
solution on the subcritical level.
