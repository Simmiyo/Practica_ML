Stable and isoperimetric regions in rotationally symmetric tori with
  decreasing Gauss curvature
In this work we classify the stable regions (second order minima of perimeter
under an area constraint) in tori of revolution with piecewise continuous
decreasing Gauss curvature from the longest parallel and with a horizontal
symmetry. Some applications to isoperimetric problems are also given.
