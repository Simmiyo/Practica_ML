Lie groups as four-dimensional special complex manifolds with Norden
  metric
An example of a four-dimensional special complex manifold with Norden metric
of constant holomorphic sectional curvature is constructed via a two-parametric
family of solvable Lie algebras. The curvature properties of the obtained
manifold are studied. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the manifold to
be isotropic K\"ahlerian are given.
