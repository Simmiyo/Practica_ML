Splitting theorems for Finsler manifolds of nonnegative Ricci curvature
We investigate the structure of a Finsler manifold of nonnegative weighted
Ricci curvature including a straight line, and extend the classical
Cheeger-Gromoll-Lichnerowicz splitting theorem. Such a space admits a
diffeomorphic, measure-preserving splitting in general. As for a special class
of Berwald spaces, we can perform the isometric splitting in the sense that
there is a one-parameter family of isometries generated from the gradient
vector field of the Busemann function. A Betti number estimate is also given
for Berwald spaces.
