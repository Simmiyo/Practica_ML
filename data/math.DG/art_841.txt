The odd-dimensional Goldberg Conjecture
An odd-dimensional version of the Goldberg conjecture was formulated and
proved by Boyer and Galicki, using an orbifold analogue of Sekigawa's formulas,
and an approximation argument of K-contact structures with quasi-regular ones.
We provide here another proof of this result and give some applications.
