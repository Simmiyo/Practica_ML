Projective relations for m-th root metric spaces
For Finsler spaces (M,F) endowed with m-th root metrics, we provide necessary
and sufficient conditions in which they are projectively flat, or projectively
related to Berwald/Riemann spaces. We also give a specific characterization for
m-th root metrics spaces of Landsberg and of Berwald type.
