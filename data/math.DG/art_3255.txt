Collapsing of Calabi-Yau manifolds and special lagrangian submanifolds
In this paper, the relationship between the existence of special lagrangian
submanifolds and the collapsing of Calabi-Yau manifolds is studied. First,
special lagrangian fibrations are constructed on some regions of bounded
curvature and sufficiently collapsed in Ricci-flat Calabi-Yau manifolds. Then,
in the opposite direction,it is shown that the existence of special lagrangian
submanifolds with small volume implies the collapsing of some regions in the
ambient Calabi-Yau manifolds.
