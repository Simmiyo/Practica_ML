The problem of prescribed critical functions
Let $(M,g)$ be a compact Riemannian manifold on dimension $n \geq 4$ not
conformally diffeomorphic to the sphere $S^n$. We prove that a smooth function
$f$ on $M$ is a critical function for a metric $\tilde{g}$ conformal to $g$ if
and only if there exists $x \in M$ such that $f(x)>0$.
