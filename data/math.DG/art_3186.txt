On Cohomological Decomposition of Almost-Complex Manifolds and
  Deformations
While small deformations of K\"ahler manifolds are K\"ahler too, we prove
that the cohomological property to be $\mathcal{C}^\infty$-pure-and-full is not
a stable condition under small deformations. This property, that has been
recently introduced and studied by T.-J. Li and W. Zhang in [Comparing tamed
and compatible symplectic cones and cohomological properties of almost complex
manifolds, Comm. Anal. Geom.] and T. Dr\v{a}ghici, T.-J. Li, and W. Zhang in
[Symplectic forms and cohomology decomposition of almost complex
four-manifolds, Int. Math. Res. Not.], [On the J-anti-invariant cohomology of
almost complex 4-manifolds, to appear in Q. J. Math.], is weaker than the
K\"ahler one and characterizes the almost-complex structures that induce a
decomposition in cohomology. We also study the stability of this property along
curves of almost-complex structures constructed starting from the harmonic
representatives in special cohomology classes.
