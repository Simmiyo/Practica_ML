Bundle 2-gerbes
We make the category BGrb_M of bundle gerbes on a manifold M into a
2-category by providing 2-cells in the form of transformations of bundle gerbe
morphisms. This description of BGrb_M as a 2-category is used to define the
notion of a bundle 2-gerbe. To every bundle 2-gerbe on M is associated a class
in H^4(M;Z). We define the notion of a bundle 2-gerbe connection and show how
this leads to a closed, integral differential 4-form on M which represents the
image in real cohomology of the class in H^4(M;Z). Some examples of bundle
2-gerbes are discussed, including the bundle 2-gerbe associated to a principal
G-bundle P \to M. It is shown that the class in H^4(M;Z) associated to this
bundle 2-gerbe coincides with the first Pontryagin class of P --- this example
was previously considered from the point of view of 2-gerbes by Brylinski and
McLaughlin.
