A Study on Dual Mannheim Partner Curves
Mannheim partner curves are studied by Liu and Wang [1,2]. Orbay and others
extended the theory of the Mannheim curves to the ruled surface in Euclidean
3-space[3]. We obtain the relationships between the curvatures and the torsions
of the dual Mannheim partner curves with respect to each other.
