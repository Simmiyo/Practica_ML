Infinitesimal Einstein Deformations of Nearly Kähler Metrics
It is well-known that every 6-dimensional strictly nearly K\"{a}hler manifold
$(M,g,J)$ is Einstein with positive scalar curvature $scal>0$. Moreover, one
can show that the space $E$ of co-closed primitive (1,1)-forms on $M$ is stable
under the Laplace operator $\Delta$. Let $E(a)$ denote the $a$-eigenspace of
the restriction of $\Delta$ to $E$. If $M$ is compact, we prove that the moduli
space of infinitesimal Einstein deformations of the nearly K\"{a}hler metric
$g$ is naturally isomorphic to the direct sum $E(scal/15)\oplus E(scal/5)\oplus
E(2scal/5)$. It is known that the last summand is itself isomorphic with the
moduli space of infinitesimal nearly K\"{a}hler deformations.
