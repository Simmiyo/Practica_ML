Complete Foliations of Space Forms by Hypersurfaces
We study foliations of space forms by complete hypersurfaces, under some mild
conditions on its higher order mean curvatures. In particular, in Euclidean
space we obtain a Bernstein-type theorem for graphs whose mean and scalar
curvature do not change sign but may otherwise be nonconstant. We also
establish the nonexistence of foliations of the standard sphere whose leaves
are complete and have constant scalar curvature, thus extending a theorem of
Barbosa, Kenmotsu and Oshikiri. For the more general case of {\em r-}minimal
foliations of the Euclidean space, possibly with a singular set, we are able to
invoke a theorem of Ferus to give conditions under which the nonsigular leaves
are foliated by hyperplanes.
