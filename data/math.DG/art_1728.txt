Curved Flats, Pluriharmonic Maps and Constant Curvature Immersions into
  Pseudo-Riemannian Space Forms
We study two aspects of the loop group formulation for isometric immersions
with flat normal bundle of space forms. The first aspect is to examine the loop
group maps along different ranges of the loop parameter. This leads to various
equivalences between global isometric immersion problems among different space
forms and pseudo-Riemannian space forms. As a corollary, we obtain a
non-immersibility theorem for spheres into certain pseudo-Riemannian spheres
and hyperbolic spaces.
  The second aspect pursued is to clarify the relationship between the loop
group formulation of isometric immersions of space forms and that of
pluriharmonic maps into symmetric spaces. We show that the objects in the first
class are, in the real analytic case, extended pluriharmonic maps into certain
symmetric spaces which satisfy an extra reality condition along a totally real
submanifold. We show how to construct such pluriharmonic maps for general
symmetric spaces from curved flats, using a generalised DPW method.
