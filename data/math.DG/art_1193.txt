On pseudo-Hermitian Einstein spaces
We describe and construct here pseudo-Hermitian structures $\theta$ without
torsion (i.e. with transversal symmetry) whose Webster-Ricci curvature tensor
is a constant multiple of the exterior differential $d\theta$. We call these
structures pseudo-Hermitian Einstein and our result states that they all can be
derived locally from K{\"a}hler-Einstein metrics. Moreover, we discuss the
corresponding Fefferman metrics of the pseudo-Hermitian Einstein structures.
These Fefferman metrics are never Einstein, but they are locally always
conformally Einstein.
