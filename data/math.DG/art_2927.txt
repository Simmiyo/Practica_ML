On the smooth rigidity of almost-Einstein manifolds with nonnegative
  isotropic curvature
Let $(M^n,g)$, $n \ge 4$, be a compact simply-connected Riemannian manifold
with nonnegative isotropic curvature. Given $0<l\le L$, we prove that there
exists $\eps = \eps (l,L,n)$ satisfying the following: If the scalar curvature
$s$ of $g$ satisfies $$ l \le s \le L $$ and the Einstein tensor satisfies $$ |
Ric - \frac {s}{n}g | \le \eps$$ then $M$ is diffeomorphic to a symmetric space
of compact type.
  This is a smooth analogue of the result of S. Brendle that a compact Einstein
manifold with nonnegative isotropic curvature is isometric to a locally
symmetric space.
