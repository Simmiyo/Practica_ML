Composition series of affine manifolds and n-gerbes
In this paper we study n-composition series of affine manifolds. One
composition series are classified using gerbe theory. It is natural to think
that n-composition series must be classified using n-gerbe theory. In the last
section of this, we propose a notion of abelian n-gerbe theory
