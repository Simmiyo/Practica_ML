Cohomology of groups of diffeomorphims related to the modules of
  differential operators on a smooth manifold
Let $M$ be a manifold and $T^*M$ be the cotangent bundle. We introduce a
1-cocycle on the group of diffeomorphisms of $M$ with values in the space of
linear differential operators acting on $C^{\infty} (T^*M).$ When $M$ is the
$n$-dimensional sphere, $S^n$, we use this 1-cocycle to compute the
first-cohomology group of the group of diffeomorphisms of $S^n$, with
coefficients in the space of linear differential operators acting on
contravariant tensor fields.
