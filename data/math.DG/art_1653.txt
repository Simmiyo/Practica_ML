Sasaki-Einstein 5-manifolds associated to toric 3-Sasaki manifolds
We give a correspondence between toric 3-Sasaki 7-manifolds S and certain
toric Sasaki-Einstein 5-manifolds M. These 5-manifolds are all diffeomorphic to
k#(S^2\times S^3), where k=2b_2(S)+1, and are given by a pencil of Sasaki
embeddings of M in S and are given concretely by the zero set of a component of
the 3-Sasaki moment map. It follows that there are infinitely many examples of
these toric Sasaki-Einstein manifolds M for each odd b_2(M)>1.
  As an application of the proof of the above, we prove that the local
deformation space of ASD structures on a compact toric ASD Einstein orbifold is
given by Joyce ansatz conformal metrics.
