Generalized Metrical Multi-Time Lagrange Model for General Relativity
  and Electromagnetism
The paper construct a suitable generalized metrical multi-time Lagrange
geometrical model for both gravitational and electromagnetic fields, in a
general setting. In this construction, the gravitational potentials are
described by a distinguished vertical metrical tensor of the form
$h^{/alpha/beta}e^{2\sigma}/phi_{ij}$.
