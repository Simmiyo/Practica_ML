Conformally invariant powers of the ambient Dirac operator
This paper constructs a family of conformally invariant differential
operators acting on spinor densities with leading part a power of the Dirac
operator. The construction applies for all powers in odd dimensions, and only
for finitely many powers in even dimensions. These operators arise naturally as
obstructions to formal solution of the Dirac equation on the Fefferman-Graham
ambient space with prescribed boundary conditions.
