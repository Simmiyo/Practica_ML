Uniqueness of H-surfaces in H^2xR, |H| <= 1/2, with boundary one or two
  parallel horizontal circles
We prove that a H-surface M in H^2xR, |H| <= 1/2, inherits the symmetries of
its boundary when the boundary is either a horizontal curve with curvature
greater than one or two parallel horizontal curves with curvature greater than
one, whose distance is greater or equal to \pi Furthermore we prove that the
asymptotic boundary of a surface with mean curvature bounded away from zero
consists of parts of straight lines, provided it is sufficiently regular
