On Embedding Circle-Bundles in Four-Manifolds
We demonstrate an obstruction to finding certain splittings of four-manifolds
along sufficiently twisted circle bundles over Riemann surfaces, arising from
Seiberg-Witten theory. These obstructions are used to show a non-splitting
result for algebraic surfaces of general type.
