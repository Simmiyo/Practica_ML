Rigidity at infinity for even-dimensional asymptotically complex
  hyperbolic spaces
Any Kaehler metric on the ball which is strongly asymptotic to complex
hyperbolic space and whose scalar curvature is no less than the one of the
complex hyperbolic space must be isometrically biholomorphic to it. This result
has been known for some time in odd complex dimension and we provide here a
proof in even dimension.
