Conformally flat Lorentzian manifolds with special holonomy groups
The local classification of conformally flat Lorentzian manifolds with
special holonomy groups is obtained. The corresponding local metrics are
certain extensions of Riemannian spaces of constant sectional curvature to
Walker metrics.
