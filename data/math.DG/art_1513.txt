On the space of metrics with invertible Dirac operator
On a compact spin manifold we study the space of Riemannian metrics for which
the Dirac operator is invertible. The first main result is a surgery theorem
stating that such a metric can be extended over the trace of a surgery of
codimension at least three. We then prove that if non-empty the space of
metrics with invertible Dirac operators is disconnected in dimensions $n \equiv
0,1,3,7 \mod 8$, $n \geq 5$. As a corollary follows results on the existence of
metrics with harmonic spinors by Hitchin and B\"ar. Finally we use computations
of the eta invariant by Botvinnik and Gilkey to find metrics with harmonic
spinors on simply connected manifolds with a cyclic group action. In particular
this applies to spheres of all dimensions $n \geq 5$.
