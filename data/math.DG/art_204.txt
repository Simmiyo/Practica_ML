Pseudoriemannian 2-Step Nilpotent Lie Groups
We begin a systematic study of these spaces, initially following along the
lines of Eberlein's comprehensive study of the Riemannian case. In particular,
we integrate the geodesic equation, discuss the structure of the isometry
group, and make a study of lattices and periodic geodesics.
  Some major differences from the Riemannian theory appear. There are many flat
groups (versus none), including Heisenberg groups. While still a semidirect
product, the isometry group can be strictly larger than the obvious analogue.
Everything is illustrated with explicit examples.
  We introduce the notion of pH-type, which refines Kaplan's H-type and
completes Ciatti's partial extension. We give a general construction for
algebras of pH-type.
