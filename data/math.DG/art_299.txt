A Hodge Theorem for Noncompact Manifolds
If M is a riemannian manifold, then the inclusion of the complex of coclosed
harmonic forms into the de Rham complex induces a linear isomorphism in
cohomology. If M has at most countably many connected components, this linear
isomorphism is a Frechet isomorphism.
