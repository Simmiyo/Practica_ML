Higher order reduction theorems for classical connections and natural
  (0,2)-tensor fields on the cotangent bundle
We generalize reduction theorems for classical connections to operators with
values in $k$-th order natural bundles. Using the first reduction theorem in
order two we classify all (0,2)-tensor fields on the cotangent bundle of a
manifold with a linear (non-symmetric) connection.
