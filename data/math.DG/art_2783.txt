Kählerian Twistor Spinors
On a K\"ahler spin manifold K\"ahlerian twistor spinors are a natural
analogue of twistor spinors on Riemannian spin manifolds. They are defined as
sections in the kernel of a first order differential operator adapted to the
K\"ahler structure, called K\"ahlerian twistor (Penrose) operator. We study
K\"ahlerian twistor spinors and give a complete description of compact K\"ahler
manifolds of constant scalar curvature admitting such spinors. As in the
Riemannian case, the existence of K\"ahlerian twistor spinors is related to the
lower bound of the spectrum of the Dirac operator.
