The Gauss map of pseudo-algebraic minimal surfaces
We refine Osserman's argument on the exceptional values of the Gauss map of
algebraic minimal surfaces. This gives an effective estimate for the number of
exceptional values and the totally ramified value number for a wider class of
complete minimal surfaces that includes algebraic minimal surfaces. It also
provides a new proof of Fujimoto's theorem for this class, which not only
simplifies the proof but also reveals the geometric meaning behind it.
