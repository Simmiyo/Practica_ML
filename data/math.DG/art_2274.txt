On the moduli of constant mean curvature cylinders of finite type in the
  3-sphere
We show that one-sided Alexandrov embedded constant mean curvature cylinders
of finite type in the 3-sphere are surfaces of revolution. This confirms a
conjecture by Pinkall and Sterling that the only embedded constant mean
curvature tori in the 3-sphere are rotational.
