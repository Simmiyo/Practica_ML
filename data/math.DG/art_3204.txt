A generalisation of the Hopf Construction and harmonic morphisms into
  $\s^2$
In this paper we construct a new family of harmonic morphisms
$\varphi:V^5\to\s^2$, where $V^5$ is a 5-dimensional open manifold contained in
an ellipsoidal hypersurface of $\c^4=\r^8$. These harmonic morphisms admit a
continuous extension to the completion ${V^{\ast}}^5$, which turns out to be an
explicit real algebraic variety. We work in the context of a generalization of
the Hopf construction and equivariant theory.
