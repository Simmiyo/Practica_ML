Geometric Algebras
This is the first paper in a series of eight where in the first three we
develop a systematic approach to the geometric algebras of multivectors and
extensors, followed by five papers where those algebraic concepts are used in a
novel presentation of several topics of the differential geometry of (smooth)
manifolds of arbitrary global topology. A key tool for the development of our
program is the mastering of the euclidean geometrical algebra of multivectors
that is detailed in the present paper.
