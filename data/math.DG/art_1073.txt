Deformation and applicability of surfaces in Lie sphere geometry
The theory of surfaces in Euclidean space can be naturally formulated in the
more general context of Legendre surfaces into the space of contact elements.
We address the question of deformability of Legendre surfaces with respect to
the symmetry group of Lie sphere contact transformations from the point of view
of the deformation theory of submanifolds in homogeneous spaces. Necessary and
sufficient conditions are provided for a Legendre surface to admit non-trivial
deformations and the corresponding existence problem is discussed.
