On Dynamical Poisson Groupoids I
We address the question of duality for the dynamical Poisson groupoids of
Etingof and Varchenko over a contractible base. We also give an explicit
description for the coboundary case associated with the solutions of the
classical dynamical Yang-Baxter equation on simple Lie algebras as classified
by the same authors. Our approach is based on the study of a class of Poisson
structures on trivial Lie groupoids within the category of biequivariant
Poisson manifolds. In the former case, it is shown that the dual Poisson
groupoid of such a dynamical Poisson groupoid is isomorphic to a Poisson
groupoid (with trivial Lie groupoid structure) within this category. In the
latter case, we find that the dual Poisson groupoid is also of dynamical type
modulo Poisson groupoid isomorphisms. For the coboundary dynamical Poisson
groupoids associated with constant r- matrices, we give an explicit
construction of the corresponding symplectic double groupoids. In this case,
the symplectic leaves of the dynamical Poisson groupoid are shown to be the
orbits of a Poisson Lie group action.
