On the Filling Invariants at Infinity of Hadamard Manifolds
We study the filling invariants at infinity div_{k} for Hadamard manifolds
defined by Brady and Farb in [Filling-invariants at infinity for manifolds of
nonpositive curvature]. Among other results, we give a positive answer to the
question they posed: whether these invariants can be used to detect the rank of
a symmetric space of noncompact type.
