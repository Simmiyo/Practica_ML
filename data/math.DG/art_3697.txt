Pinching on open manifolds
We show that the 2-jet bundle of local Riemannian metrics on an arbitrary
differentiable manifold admits a section which pointwise fulfills the curvature
relation sec(g)=a for any real number a. It follows by Gromov's h-principle for
open, invariant differential relations that every noncompact differentiable
manifold carries arbitrarily pinched (incomplete) Riemannian metrics.
