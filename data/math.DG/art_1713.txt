On a spin conformal invariant on manifolds with boundary
On a n-dimensional connected compact manifold with non-empty boundary
equipped with a Riemannian metric, a spin structure and a chirality operator,
we study some properties of a spin conformal invariant defined from the first
eigenvalue of the Dirac operator under the chiral bag boundary condition. More
precisely, we show that we can derive a spinorial analogue of Aubin's
inequality.
