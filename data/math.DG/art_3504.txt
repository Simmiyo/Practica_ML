Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalism in Field Theory: a simple model
The static of smooth maps from the two-dimensional disc to a smooth manifold
can be regarded as a simplified version of the Classical Field Theory. In this
paper we construct the Tulczyjew triple for the problem and describe the
Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalism. We outline also natural generalizations
of this approach to arbitrary dimensions.
