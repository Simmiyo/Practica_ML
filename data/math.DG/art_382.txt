Generalized Metrical Multi-Time Lagrange Geometry of Physical Field
The paper developes a geometrization of a Kronecker $h$-regular vertical
fundamental metrical d-tensor $G^{(\alpha)(\beta)}_{(i)(j)}$ on the jet fibre
bundle of order one $J^1(T,M)$. This geometrization gives a mathematical model
for both gravitational and electromagnetic field theory, in a general setting.
In this context, the Einstein and Maxwell equations are described.
