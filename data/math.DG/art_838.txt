Compact Embedded Minimal Surfaces of Positive Genus Without Area Bounds
Let M be a 3-manifold (possibly with boundary). We show that, for any
positive integer g, there exists an open nonempty set of metrics on M for each
of which there are stable compact embedded minimal surfaces of genus g with
arbitrarily large area. This extends the result of Colding and Minicozzi for
g=1.
