Singularities of Blaschke normal maps of convex surfaces
We prove that the difference between the numbers of positive swallowtails and
negative swallowtails of the Blaschke normal map for a given convex surface in
affine space is equal to the Euler number of the subset where the affine shape
operator has negative determinant.
