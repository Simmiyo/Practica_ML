Dirac eigenvalues estimates in terms of symmetric tensors
We review some recent results concerning lower eigenvalues estimates for the
Dirac operator [6, 7]. We show that Friedrich's inequality can be improved via
certain well-chosen symmetric tensors and provide an application to Sasakian
spin manifolds.
