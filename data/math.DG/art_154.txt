A comparison of the eigenvalues of the Dirac and Laplace operator on the
  two-dimensional torus
We compare the eigenvalues of the Dirac and Laplace operator on a
two-dimensional torus with respect to the trivial spin structure. In
particular, we compute their variation up to order 4 upon deformation of the
flat metric, study the corresponding Hamiltonian and discuss several families
of examples.
