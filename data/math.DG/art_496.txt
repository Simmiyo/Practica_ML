Metrics of positive Ricci curvature on bundles
We construct new examples of manifolds of positive Ricci curvature which,
topologically, are vector bundles over compact manifolds of almost nonnegative
Ricci curvature. In particular, we prove that if E is the total space of a
vector bundle over a compact manifold of nonnegative Ricci curvature, then the
product of E and R^p admits a complete metric of positive Ricci curvature for
all large p.
