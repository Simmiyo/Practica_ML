On the Cappell-Lee-Miller glueing theorem
We formulate a more conceptual interpretation of the Cappell-Lee-Miller
glueing/splitting theorem using the new language of asymptotic maps and
asymptotic exactness. Additionally, we present an asymptotic description of the
Mayer-Vietoris sequence naturally associated to the Cech cohomology of the
sheaf of local solutions of a Dirac type operator. We discuss applications to
eigenvalue estimates, approximation of obstruction bundles and glueing of
determinant line bundles frequently arising in gauge theoretic problems. The
operators involved in all these results need not be translation invariant.
