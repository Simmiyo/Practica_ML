Nilsolitons of H-type in the Lorentzian setting
It is known that all left-invariant pseudo-Riemannian metrics on $H_3$ are
algebraic Ricci solitons. We consider generalizations of Riemannian $H$-type,
namely pseudo$H$-type and $pH$-type. We study algebraic Ricci solitons of
left-invariant Lorentzian metrics on 2-step nilpotent Lie groups of both types.
