Taut submanifolds
This is a short, elementary survey article about taut submanifolds. In order
to simplify the exposition, we restrict to the case of compact smooth
submanifolds of Euclidean or spherical spaces. Some new, partial results
concerning taut 4-manifolds are discussed at the end of the text.
