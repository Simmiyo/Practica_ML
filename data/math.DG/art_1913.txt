Grassmann geometries in infinite dimensional homogeneous spaces and an
  application to reflective submanifolds
Let U be a real form of a complex semisimple Lie group, and tau, sigma, a
pair of commuting involutions on U. This data corresponds to a reflective
submanifold of a symmetric space, U/K. We define an associated integrable
system, and describe how to produce solutions from curved flats.
  The solutions are shown to correspond to various special submanifolds,
depending on which homogeneous space U/L one projects to. We apply the
construction to a question which generalizes, to the context of reflective
submanifolds of arbitrary symmetric spaces, the problem of isometric immersions
of space forms with negative extrinsic curvature and flat normal bundle. For
this problem, we prove that the only cases where local solutions exist are the
previously known cases of space forms, in addition to constant curvature
Lagrangian immersions into complex projective and complex hyperbolic spaces. We
also prove non-existence of global solutions in the compact case.
  The solutions associated to other reflective submanifolds correspond to
special deformations of lower dimensional submanifolds. As an example, we
obtain a special class of surfaces in the 6-sphere.
