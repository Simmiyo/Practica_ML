Construction of Hamiltonian-minimal Lagrangian submanifolds in complex
  Euclidean space
We describe several families of Lagrangian submanifolds in the complex
Euclidean space which are H-minimal, i.e. critical points of the volume
functional restricted to Hamiltonian variations. We make use of various
constructions involving planar, spherical and hyperbolic curves, as well as
Legendrian submanifolds of the odd-dimensional unit sphere.
