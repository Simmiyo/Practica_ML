Around heat decay on forms and relations of nilpotent Lie groups
One knows that the large time heat decay exponent on a nilpotent group is
given by half the growing rate of the volume of its large balls. This work
deals with the similar problem of trying to interpret geometrically the heat
decay on (one) forms. We will show how it is (partially) related to the depth
of the relations required to define the group. The tools used apply in general
on Carnot-Caratheodory manifolds.
