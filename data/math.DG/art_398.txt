Twisted connected sums and special Riemannian holonomy
We give a new, connected-sum-like construction of Riemannian metrics with
special holonomy G_2 on compact 7-manifolds. The construction is based on a
gluing theorem for appropriate elliptic partial differential equations. As a
prerequisite, we also obtain asymptotically cylindrical Riemannian manifolds
with holonomy SU(3) building up on the work of Tian and Yau. Examples of new
topological types of compact 7-manifolds with holonomy G_2 are constructed
using Fano 3-folds.
