Biminimal immersions
We study biminimal immersions, that is immersions which are critical points
of the bienergy for normal variations with fixed energy. We give a geometrical
description of the Euler-Lagrange equation associated to biminimal immersions
for: i) biminimal curves in a Riemannian manifold, with particular care to the
case of curves in a space form ii) isometric immersions of codimension one in a
Riemannian manifold, in particular for surfaces of a three-dimensional
manifold. We describe two methods to construct families of biminimal surfaces
using both Riemannian and horizontally homothetic submersions.
