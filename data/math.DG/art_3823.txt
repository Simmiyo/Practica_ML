The classification of orbits on certain exceptional Jordan algebra under
  the automorphism group
Let $\mathcal{J}^1$ be the real form of complex simple Jordan algebra with
the automorphism group $G$ of type $F_{4(-20)}$. Explicitly, we give the orbit
decomposition of $\mathcal{J}^1$ under the action of $G$ and determine the Lie
group structure of stabilizer for each $G$-orbit on $\mathcal{J}^1$.
