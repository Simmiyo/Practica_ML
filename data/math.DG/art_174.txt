On some methods of construction of invariant normalizations of lightlike
  hypersurfaces
The authors study the geometry of lightlike hypersurfaces on
pseudo-Riemannian manifolds $(M, g)$ of Lorentzian signature. Such
hypersurfaces are of interest in general relativity since they can be models of
different types of physical horizons. For a lightlike hypersurface $V \subset
(M, g)$ of general type and for some special lightlike hypersurfaces (namely,
for totally umbilical and belonging to a manifold $(M, g)$ of constant
curvature), in a third-order neighborhood of a point $x \in V$, the authors
construct invariant normalizations intrinsically connected with the geometry of
$V$ and investigate affine connections induced by these normalizations. For
this construction, they used relative and absolute invariants defined by the
first and second fundamental forms of $V$. The authors show that if $\dim M =
4$, their methods allow to construct three invariant normalizations and affine
connections intrinsically connected with the geometry of $V$. Such a
construction is given in the present paper for the first time. The authors also
consider the fibration of isotropic geodesics of $V$ and investigate their
singular points and singular submanifolds.
