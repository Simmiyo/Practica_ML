Cocalibrated G_2-structures on products of four- and three-dimensional
  Lie groups
Cocalibrated G_2-structures are structures naturally induced on hypersurfaces
in Spin(7)-manifolds. Conversely, one may start with a seven-dimensional
manifold M endowed with a cocalibrated G_2-structure and construct via the
Hitchin flow a Spin(7)-manifold which contains M as a hypersurface. In this
article, we consider left-invariant cocalibrated G_2-structures on Lie groups G
which are a direct product G=G_4\times G_3 of a four-dimensional Lie group G_4
and a three-dimensional Lie group G_3. We achieve a full classification of the
Lie groups G=G_4\times G_3 which admit a left-invariant cocalibrated
G_2-structure.
