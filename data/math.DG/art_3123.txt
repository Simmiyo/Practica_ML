The geometry of closed conformal vector fields on Riemannian spaces
In this paper we examine different aspects of the geometry of closed
conformal vector fields on Riemannian manifolds. We begin by getting
obstructions to the existence of closed conformal and nonparallel vector fields
on complete manifolds with nonpositive Ricci curvature, thus generalizing a
theorem of T. K. Pan. Then we explain why it is so difficult to find examples,
other than trivial ones, of spaces having at least two closed, conformal and
homothetic vector fields. We then focus on isometric immersions, firstly
generalizing a theorem of J. Simons on cones with parallel mean curvature to
spaces furnished with a closed, Ricci null conformal vector field; then we
prove general Bernstein-type theorems for certain complete, not necessarily
cmc, hypersurfaces of Riemannian manifolds furnished with closed conformal
vector fields. In particular, we obtain a generalization of theorems J. Jellett
and A. Barros and P. Sousa for complete cmc radial graphs over finitely
punctured geodesic spheres of Riemannian space forms.
