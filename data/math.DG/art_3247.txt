Rigidity and $L^2$ cohomology of hyperbolic manifolds
When $X=\Gamma\backslash \H^n$ is a real hyperbolic manifold, it is already
known that if the critical exponent is small enough then some cohomology spaces
and some spaces of $L^2$ harmonic forms vanish. In this paper, we show rigidity
results in the borderline case of these vanishing results.
