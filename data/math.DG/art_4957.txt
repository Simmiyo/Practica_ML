Second-Order Renormalization Group Flow of Three-Dimensional Homogeneous
  Geometries
We study the behavior of the second order Renormalization Group flow on
locally homogeneous metrics on closed three-manifolds. In the cases $\mathbb
R^3$ and $\text{SO}(3)\times \R$, the flow is qualitatively the same as the
Ricci flow. In the cases $\text{H}(3)$ and $\text{H}(2)\times \R$, if the
curvature is small, then the flow expands as in the Ricci flow case, while if
the curvature is large, then the flow contracts and forms a singularity in
finite time. The main focus of the paper is the flow on the $\text{SU}(2)$,
$\text{Nil}$, $\text{Sol}$, and $\text{SL}(2,\R)$ 3-geometries, with two of the
three principal directions set equal. The configuration spaces for these
geometries are two dimensional, and we can consequently apply phase plane
techniques to the study. For the $\text{SU}(2)$ case, the flow is everywhere
qualitatively the same as Ricci flow. For the $\text{Nil}$, $\text{Sol}$, and
$\text{SL}(2,\R)$ cases, we show that the configuration space is partitioned
into two regions which are delineated by a solution curve of the flow that
depends on the coupling parameter: in one of the regions, the flow develops
cigar or pancake singularities characteristic of the Ricci flow, while in the
other both directions shrink. In the $\text{Nil}$ case we obtain a
characterization of the full 3-dimensional flow.
