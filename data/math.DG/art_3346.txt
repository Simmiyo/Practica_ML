Finitness of the basic intersection cohomology of a Killing foliation
We prove that the basic intersection cohomology $ {I
H}^{^{*}}_{_{\bar{p}}}{(M/\mathcal{F})}, $ where $\mathcal{F}$ is the singular
foliation determined by an isometric action of a Lie group $G$ on the compact
manifold $M$, is finite dimensional.
