The Blaschke-Lebesgue problem for constant width bodies of revolution
We prove that among all constant width bodies of revolution, the minimum of
the ratio of the volume to the cubed width is attained by the constant width
body obtained by rotation of the Reuleaux triangle about an axis of symmetry.
