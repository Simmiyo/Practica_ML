Some families of special Lagrangian tori
We give a simple proof of the local version of a result of R. Bryant, stating
that any 3-dimensional Riemannian manifold can be isometrically embedded as a
special Lagrangian submanifold in a Calabi-Yau manifold. We refine the theorem
proving that a certain class of one-parameter families of metrics on a 3-torus
can be isometrically embedded in a Calabi-Yau manifold as a one-parameter
family of special Lagrangian submanifolds. We use our examples of one-parameter
families to show that the semi-flat metric on the mirror manifold proposed be
N. Hitchin is not necessarily Ricci-flat in dimension 3.
