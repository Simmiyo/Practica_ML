Einstein Metrics from Symmetry and Bundle Constructions: A Sequel
This is a sequel to the survey given by the author in Surveys in Differential
Geometry Vol. 6 in 1999. The present survey covers selected developments since
1999 to 2011 dealing with the construction of Einstein metrics on bundles and
Einstein metrics with symmetries.
