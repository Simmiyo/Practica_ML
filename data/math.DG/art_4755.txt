On Almost-Riemannian Surfaces
An almost-Riemannian structure on a surface is a generalized Riemannian
structure whose local orthonormal frames are given by Lie bracket generating
pairs of vector fields that can become collinear. The distribution generated
locally by orthonormal frames has maximal rank at almost every point of the
surface, but in general it has rank 1 on a nonempty set which is generically a
smooth curve. In this paper we provide a short introduction to 2-dimensional
almost-Riemannian geometry highlighting its novelties with respect to
Riemannian geometry. We present some results that investigate topological,
metric and geometric aspects of almost- Riemannian surfaces from a local and
global point of view.
