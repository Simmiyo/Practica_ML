Sequences of Willmore surfaces
In this paper we develop the theory of Willmore sequences for Willmore
surfaces in the 4-sphere. We show that under appropriate conditions this
sequence has to terminate. In this case the Willmore surface either is the
twistor projection of a holomorphic curve into complex projective space or the
inversion of a minimal surface with planar ends in 4-space. These results give
a unified explanation of previous work on the characterization of Willmore
spheres and Willmore tori with non-trivial normal bundles by various authors.
