Local quaternionic rigidity for complex hyperbolic lattices
Let $\Gamma \stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} L$ be a lattice in the real simple
Lie group $L$. If $L$ is of rank at least 2 (respectively locally isomorphic to
$Sp(n,1)$) any unbounded morphism $\rho: \Gamma \longrightarrow G$ into a
simple real Lie group $G$ essentially extends to a Lie morphism $\rho_L: L
\longrightarrow G$ (Margulis's superrigidity theorem, respectively Corlette's
theorem). In particular any such morphism is infinitesimally, thus locally,
rigid. On the other hand, for $L=SU(n,1)$, even morphisms of the form $\rho :
\Gamma \stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} L \longrightarrow G$ are not
infinitesimally rigid in general. Almost nothing is known about their local
rigidity. In this paper we prove that any {\em cocompact} lattice $\Gamma$ in
SU(n,1) is essentially locally rigid (while in general not infinitesimally
rigid) in the quaternionic groups $Sp(n,1)$, SU(2n,2) or SO(4n,4) (for the
natural sequence of embeddings $SU(n,1) \subset Sp(n,1) \subset SU(2n,2)
\subset SO(4n,4))$.
