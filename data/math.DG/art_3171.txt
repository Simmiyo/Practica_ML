On a class of hypersurfaces in $\Sf^n\times \R$ and $\Hy^n\times \R$
We give a complete description of all hypersurfaces of the product spaces
$\Sf^n\times \R$ and $\Hy^n\times \R$ that have flat normal bundle when
regarded as submanifolds with codimension two of the underlying flat spaces
$\R^{n+2}\supset \Sf^n\times \R$ and $\Le^{n+2}\supset \Hy^n\times \R$. We
prove that any such hypersurface in $\Sf^n\times \R$ (respectively,
$\Hy^n\times \R$) can be constructed by means of a family of parallel
hypersurfaces in $\Sf^n$ (respectively, $\Hy^n$) and a smooth function of one
variable. Then we show that constant mean curvature hypersurfaces in this class
are given in terms of an isoparametric family in the base space and a solution
of a certain ODE. For minimal hypersurfaces such solution is explicitly
determined in terms of the mean curvature function of the isoparametric family.
As another consequence of our general result, we classify the constant angle
hypersurfaces of $\Sf^n\times \R$ and $\Hy^n\times \R$, that is, hypersurfaces
with the property that its unit normal vector field makes a constant angle with
the unit vector field spanning the second factor $\R$. This extends previous
results by Dillen, Fastenakels, Van der Veken, Vrancken and Munteanu for
surfaces in $\Sf^2\times \R$ and $\Hy^2\times \R$.
  Our method also yields a classification of all Euclidean hypersurfaces with
the property that the tangent component of a constant vector field in the
ambient space is a principal direction, in particular of all Euclidean
hypersurfaces whose unit normal vector field makes a constant angle with a
fixed direction.
