Canonical-type connection on almost contact manifolds with B-metric
The canonical-type connection on the almost contact manifolds with B-metric
is constructed. It is proved that its torsion is invariant with respect to a
subgroup of the general conformal transformations of the almost contact
B-metric structure. The basic classes of the considered manifolds are
characterized in terms of the torsion of the canonical-type connection.
