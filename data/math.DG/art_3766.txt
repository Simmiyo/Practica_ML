On the self-CPG curves and the Björling problem
Schwartz's solution to the Bj\"orling problem leads to an equivalence class
of spatial strips S(t)=(c(t),n(t)) which produce equivalent minimal surfaces.
For the particular case when the generating strip S(t) belongs to some plane E
and c(t) is symmetric with respect to some straight line in E, the symmetries
of the minimal surface permit us to identify another planar curve ~c(t) that we
call the CPG curve to c(t). A simple symmetric argument shows that self-CPG
curves produce minimal surfaces whose adjoint surface contains another self-CPG
curve. We ask for minimal surfaces generated by self-CPG curves which are
self-adjoints.
