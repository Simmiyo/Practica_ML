Connections and curvings on lifting bundle gerbes
We construct a connection and a curving on a bundle gerbe associated with
lifting a structure group of a principal bundle to a central extension. The
construction is based on certain structures on the bundle, i.e. connections and
splittings. The Deligne cohomology class of the lifting bundle gerbe with the
connection and with the curving coincides with the obstruction class of the
lifting problem with these structures.
