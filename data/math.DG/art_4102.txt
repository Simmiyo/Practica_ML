The Semi-linear Torsional Rigidity on a Complete Riemannian Two-Manifold
This note is concerned with some essential properties (optimal isoperimetry,
first variation, and monotonicity formula) of the so-called
$[0,1)\ni\gamma$-torsional rigidity $\mathcal{T}_{\gamma,\mathsf{g}}$ on a
complete Riemannian two-manifold $(\mathbb M^2,\mathsf{g})$. Even in the
special case of $\mathbb R^2$, major results are new.
