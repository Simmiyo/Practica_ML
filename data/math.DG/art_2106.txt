On the spinor structure of the homogeneous and isotropic universe in
  closed model
The closed homogeneous and isotropic universe is considered. The bundles of
Weyl and Dirac spinors for this universe are explicitly described. Some
explicit formulas for the basic fields and for the connection components in
stereographic and in spherical coordinates are presented.
