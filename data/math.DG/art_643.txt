On hypercomplexifying real forms of arbitrary rank
For certain problems involving vector fields, it is possible to find an
associated imaginary field that, in conjunction with the first, forms a complex
field for which the equation can be solved. This result is generalized to
arbitrary Clifford algebras, followed by quaternionic vectors as a special
case. All results are shown to reduce to the established method of
complexifying vector fields. For simplicity, differential forms are used rather
than vector notation.
