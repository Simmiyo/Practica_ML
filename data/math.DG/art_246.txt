Examples of Riemannian manifolds with positive curvature almost
  everywhere
We show that the unit tangent bundle of S^4 and a real cohomology CP^3 admit
Riemannian metrics with positive sectional curvature almost everywhere. These
are the only examples so far with positive curvature almost everywhere that are
not also known to admit positive curvature.
