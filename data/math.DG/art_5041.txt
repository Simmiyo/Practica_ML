Ricci-quadratic homogeneous Randers spaces
A Finsler space is called Ricci-quadratic if its Ricci curvature $Ric(x,y)$
is quadratic in $y$. It is called a Berwald space if its Chern connection
defines a linear connection directly on the underlying manifold $M$. In this
article, we prove that a homogeneous Randers space is Ricci-quadratic if and
only if it is of Berwald type.
