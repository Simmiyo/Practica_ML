Existence of non-isotropic conjugate points on rank one normal
  homogeneous spaces
We give a positive answer to the Chavel's conjecture [J. Diff. Geom. 4
(1970), 13-20]: a simply connected rank one normal homogeneous space is
symmetric if any pair of conjugate points are isotropic. It implies that all
simply connected rank one normal homogeneous space with the property that the
isotropy action is variational complete is a rank one symmetric space.
