Conformal Killing forms on Riemannian manifolds
Conformal Killing forms are a natural generalization of conformal vector
fields on Riemannian manifolds. They are defined as sections in the kernel of a
conformally invariant first order differential operator. We show the existence
of conformal Killing forms on nearly Kaehler and weak G_2-manifolds. Moreover,
we give a complete description of special conformal Killing forms. A further
result is a sharp upper bound on the dimension of the space of conformal
Killing forms.
