Vanshing Theorems for Quaternionic Kaehler Manifolds
We discuss a peculiar interplay between the representation theory of the
holonomy group of a Riemannian manifold, the Weitzenboeck formula for the
Hodge-Laplace operator on forms and the Lichnerowicz formula for twisted Dirac
operators. For quaternionic Kaehler manifolds this leads to simple proofs of
eigenvalue estimates for Dirac and Laplace operators. Moreover it enables us to
determine which representations can contribute to harmonic forms. As a
corollary we prove the vanishing of certain odd Betti numbers on compact
quaternionic Kaehler manifolds of negative scalar curvature. We simplify the
proofs of several related results in the positive case.
