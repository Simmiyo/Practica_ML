A sequence of connections and a characterization of Kähler manifolds
We study a sequence of connections which is associated with a Riemannian
metric and an almost symplectic structure on a manifold. We prove that if this
sequence is trivial (i.e. constant) or 2-periodic, then the manifold has a
canonical K\"ahler structure.
