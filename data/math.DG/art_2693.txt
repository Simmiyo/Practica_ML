Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces in Lorentz-Minkowski space
We review part of the classical theory of curves and surfaces in
$3$-dimensional Lorentz-Minkowski space. We focus in spacelike surfaces with
constant mean curvature pointing the differences and similarities with the
Euclidean space.
