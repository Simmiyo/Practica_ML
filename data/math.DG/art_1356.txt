Locally conformal parallel $G_2$ and $Spin(7)$ manifolds
We characterize compact locally conformal parallel $G_2$ (respectively,
$Spin(7)$) manifolds as fiber bundles over $S^1$ with compact nearly K\"ahler
(respectively, compact nearly parallel $G_2$) fiber. A more specific
characterization is provided when the local parallel structures are flat.
