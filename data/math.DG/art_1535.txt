Density theorems for complete minimal surfaces in R^3
In this paper we have proved several approximation theorems for the family of
minimal surfaces in R^3 that imply, among other things, that complete minimal
surfaces are dense in the space of all minimal surfaces endowed with the
topology of C^k convergence on compact sets, for any k.
  As a consequence of the above density result, we have been able to produce
the first example of a complete proper minimal surface in R^3 with uncountably
many ends.
