Singular Riemannian metrics, sub-rigidity vs rigidity
We analyze sub-Riemannian and lightlike metrics from the point of view of
their rigidity as geometric structures. Following Cartan's and Gromov's formal
definitions, they are never rigid, yet, in generic cases, they naturally give
rise to rigid geometric structures!?
