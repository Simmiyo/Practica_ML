Mass endomorphism, surgery and perturbations
We prove that the mass endomorphism associated to the Dirac operator on a
Riemannian manifold is non-zero for generic Riemannian metrics. The proof
involves a study of the mass endomorphism under surgery, its behavior near
metrics with harmonic spinors, and analytic perturbation arguments.
