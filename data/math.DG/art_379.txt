Families of (1,2)-Symplectic M etrics on Full Flag Manifolds
We obtain new families of (1,2)-symplectic invariant metrics on the full
complex flag manifolds F(n). For n > 4, we characterize n-3 different
n-dimensional families of (1,2)-symplectic invariant metrics on F(n). Any of
these families corresponds to a different class of non-integrable invariant
almost complex structure on F(n).
