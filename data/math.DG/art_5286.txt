Lecture notes on the Kähler-Ricci flow
These lecture notes give an introduction to the Kahler-Ricci flow. They are
based on lectures given by the authors at the conference "Analytic Aspects of
Complex Algebraic Geometry", held at the Centre International de Rencontres
Mathematiques in Luminy, in February 2011.
