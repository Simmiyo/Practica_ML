Stable constant mean curvature hypersurfaces are area minimizing in
  small L^1 neighborhoods
We prove that a strictly stable constant-mean-curvature hypersurface in a
smooth manifold of dimension less than or equal to 7 is uniquely homologically
area minimizing for fixed volume in a small L^1 neighborhood.
