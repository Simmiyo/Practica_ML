A manifold structure for the group of orbifold diffeomorphisms of a
  smooth orbifold
For a compact, smooth C^r orbifold (without boundary), we show that the
topological structure of the orbifold diffeomorphism group is a Banach manifold
for finite r \ge 1 and a Frechet manifold if r=infty. In each case, the local
model is the separable Banach (Frechet) space of C^r (C^infty, resp.)
orbisections of the tangent orbibundle.
