Symplectic reduction and a weighted multiplicity formula for twisted
  Spin$^c$-Dirac operators
We extend our earlier work in [TZ1], where an analytic approach to the
Guillemin-Sternberg conjecture [GS] was developed, to cases where the
Spin$^c$-complex under consideration is allowed to be further twisted by
certain natural exterior power bundles. The main result is a weighted
quantization formula in the presence of commuting Hamiltonian actions. The
corresponding Morse type inequalities in holomorphic situations are also
established.
