Minimality in CR geometry and the CR Yamabe problem on CR manifolds with
  boundary
We study the minimality of an isometric immersion of a Riemannian manifold
into a strictly pseudoconvex CR manifold endowed with the Webster metric hence
formulate a version of the CR Yamabe problem for CR manifolds-with-boundary.
This is shown to be a nonlinear subelliptic problem of variational origin.
