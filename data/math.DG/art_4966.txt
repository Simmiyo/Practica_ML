Commuting foliations
The aim of this paper is to extend the notion of commutativity of vector
fields to the category of singular foliations, using Nambu structures, i.e.
integrable multi-vector fields. We will classify the relationship between
singular foliations and Nambu structures, and show some basic results about
commuting Nambu structures.
