Non-collapsing in mean-convex mean curvature flow
We provide a direct proof of a non-collapsing estimate for compact
hypersurfaces with positive mean curvature moving under the mean curvature
flow: Precisely, if every point on the initial hypersurface admits an interior
sphere with radius inversely proportional to the mean curvature at that point,
then this remains true for all positive times in the interval of existence.
