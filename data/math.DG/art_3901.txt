From Infinitesimal Harmonic Transformations to Ricci Solitons
The concept of the Ricci soliton was introduced by Hamilton. Ricci soliton is
defined by vector field and it's a natural generalization of Einstein metric.
We have shown earlier that the vector field of Ricci soliton is an
infinitesimal harmonic transformation. In our paper, we survey Ricci solitons
geometry as an application of the theory of infinitesimal harmonic
transformations.
