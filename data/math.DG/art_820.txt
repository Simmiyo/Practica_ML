Least-perimeter partitions of the disk into three regions of given areas
We prove that the unique least-perimeter way of partitioning the unit
2-dimensional disk into three regions of prescribed areas is by means of the
standard graph consisting in three balanced constant geodesic curvature curves
meeting themselves at 120 degrees, and reaching orthogonally the boundary of
the disk.
