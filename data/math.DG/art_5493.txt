The Sasaki-Ricci flow on Sasakian 3-spheres
We show that on a Sasakian 3-sphere the Sasaki-Ricci flow initiating from a
Sasakian metric of positive transverse scalar curvature converges to a gradient
Sasaki- Ricci soliton. We also show the existence and uniqueness of gradient
Sasaki-Ricci soliton on each Sasakian 3-sphere.
