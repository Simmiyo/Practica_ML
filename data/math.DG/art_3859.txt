An Invariant Theory of Spacelike Surfaces in the Four-dimensional
  Minkowski Space
We consider spacelike surfaces in the four-dimensional Minkowski space and
introduce geometrically an invariant linear map of Weingarten-type in the
tangent plane at any point of the surface under consideration. This allows us
to introduce principal lines and an invariant moving frame field. Writing
derivative formulas of Frenet-type for this frame field, we obtain eight
invariant functions. We prove a fundamental theorem of Bonnet-type, stating
that these eight invariants under some natural conditions determine the surface
up to a motion. We show that the basic geometric classes of spacelike surfaces
in the four-dimensional Minkowski space, determined by conditions on their
invariants, can be interpreted in terms of the properties of the two geometric
figures: the tangent indicatrix, and the normal curvature ellipse. We apply our
theory to a class of spacelike general rotational surfaces.
