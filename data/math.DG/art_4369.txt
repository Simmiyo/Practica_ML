The Yang-Mills flow and the Atiyah-Bott formula on compact Kahler
  manifolds
We study the Yang-Mills flow on a holomorphic vector bundle E over a compact
Kahler manifold X . Along a solution of the flow, we show the curvature
$i\Lambda F(A_t)$ approaches in $L^2$ an endomorphism with constant eigenvalues
given by the slopes of the quotients from the Harder-Narasimhan filtration of
E. This proves a sharp lower bound for the Hermitian-Yang-Mills functional and
thus the Yang-Mills functional, generalizing to arbitrary dimension a formula
of Atiyah and Bott first proven on Riemann surfaces. Furthermore, we show any
reflexive extension to all of X of the limiting bundle $E_\infty$ is isomorphic
to $Gr(E)^{\star\star}$, verifying a conjecture of Bando and Siu.
