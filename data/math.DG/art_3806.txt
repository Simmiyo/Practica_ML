On the classification of warped product Einstein metrics
In this paper we take the perspective introduced by Case-Shu-Wei of studying
warped product Einstein metrics through the equation for the Ricci curvature of
the base space. They call this equation on the base the $m$-Quasi Einstein
equation, but we will also call it the $(\lambda,n+m)$-Einstein equation. In
this paper we extend the work of Case-Shu-Wei and some earlier work of Kim-Kim
to allow the base to have non-empty boundary. This is a natural case to
consider since a manifold without boundary often occurs as a warped product
over a manifold with boundary, and in this case we get some interesting new
canonical examples. We also derive some new formulas involving curvatures which
are analogous to those for the gradient Ricci solitons. As an application, we
characterize warped product Einstein metrics when the base is locally
conformally flat.
