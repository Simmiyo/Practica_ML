Lie contact structures and chains
Lie contact structures generalize the classical Lie sphere geometry of
oriented hyperspheres in the standard sphere. They can be equivalently
described as parabolic geometries corresponding to the contact grading of
orthogonal real Lie algebra. It follows the underlying geometric structure can
be interpreted in several equivalent ways. In particular, we show this is given
by a split-quaternionic structure on the contact distribution, which is
compatible with the Levi bracket. In this vein, we study the geometry of
chains, a distinguished family of curves appearing in any parabolic contact
geometry. Also to the system of chains there is associated a canonical
parabolic geometry of specific type. Up to some exceptions in low dimensions,
it turns out this can be obtained by an extension of the parabolic geometry
associated to the Lie contact structure if and only if the latter is locally
flat. In that case we can show that chains are never geodesics of an affine
connection, hence, in particular, the path geometry of chains is always
non-trivial. Using appropriately this fact, we conclude that the path geometry
of chains allows to recover the Lie contact structure, hence, in particular,
transformations preserving chains must preserve the Lie contact structure.
