Isophote curves on spacelike surfaces in Lorentz-Minkowski space E31
Isophote curve consists of a locus of surface points whose normal vectors
make a constant angle with a fixed vector (the axis). In this paper, we define
an isophote curve on a spacelike surface in Lorentz-Minkowski space and then
find its axis as timelike and spacelike vectors via the Darboux frame. Besides,
we give some characterizations concerning isophote curve and its axis.
