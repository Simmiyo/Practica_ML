The strong elliptic maximum principle for vector bundles and
  applications to minimal maps
Based on works by Hopf, Weinberger, Hamilton and Evans, we state and prove
the strong elliptic maximum principle for smooth sections in vector bundles
over Riemannian manifolds and give some applications in Differential Geometry.
Moreover, we use this maximum principle to obtain various rigidity theorems and
Bernstein type theorems in higher codimension for minimal maps between
Riemannian manifolds.
