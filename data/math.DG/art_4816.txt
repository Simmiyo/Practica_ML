The existence of light-like homogeneous geodesics in homogeneous
  Lorentzian manifolds
In previous papers, a fundamental affine method for studying homogeneous
geodesics was developed. Using this method and elementary differential topology
it was proved that any homogeneous affine manifold and in particular any
homogeneous pseudo-Riemannian manifold admits a homogeneous geodesic through
arbitrary point. In the present paper this affine method is refined and adapted
to the pseudo-Riemannian case. Using this method and elementary topology it is
proved that any homogeneous Lorentzian manifold of even dimension admits a
light-like homogeneous geodesic. The method is illustrated in detail with an
example of the Lie group of dimension 3 with an invariant metric, which does
not admit any light-like homogeneous geodesic.
