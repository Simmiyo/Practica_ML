Wormholes in ACH Einstein manifolds
We give a new construction of Einstein and Kaehler-Einstein manifolds which
are asymptotically complex hyperbolic, inspired by the work of Mazzeo-Pacard in
the real hyperbolic case. The idea is to develop a gluing theorem for 1-handle
surgery at infinity, which generalizes the Klein construction for the complex
hyperbolic metric.
