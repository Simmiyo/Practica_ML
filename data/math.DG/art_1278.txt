Proper Affine Vector Fields in Plane Symmetric Static Space-Times
A study of proper affine vector fields in plane symmetric static space-times
by using the rank of the Rieman matrix and holonomy. Studying proper affine
vector fields in each case, It is shown that the special class of the above
space-times admit proper affine vector fields.
