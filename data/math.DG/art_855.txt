A conformally invariant sphere theorem in four dimensions
In this paper we provide a sharp characterization of the smooth
four-dimensional sphere. The assumptions of the theorem are conformally
invariant, and can be reduced to an L^2 inequality of the Weyl tensor and
positivity of the Yamabe invariant.
