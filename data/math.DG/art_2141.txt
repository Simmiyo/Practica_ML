Lie groups of bundle automorphisms and their extensions
We describe natural abelian extensions of the Lie algebra $\aut(P)$ of
infinitesimal automorphisms of a principal bundle over a compact manifold $M$
and discuss their integrability to corresponding Lie group extensions. Already
the case of a trivial bundle $P = M \times K$ is quite interesting. In this
case, we show that essentially all central extensions of the gauge algebra
$C^\infty(M,\fk)$ can be obtained from three fundamental types of cocycles with
values in one of the spaces $\fz := C^\infty(M,V)$, $\Omega^1(M,V)$ and
$\Omega^1(M,V)/\dd C^\infty(M,V)$. These cocycles extend to $\aut(P)$, and,
under the assumption that $TM$ is trivial, we also describe the space
$H^2({\cal V}(M),\fz)$ classifying the twists of these extensions. We then show
that all fundamental types have natural generalizations to non-trivial bundles
and explain under which conditions they extend to $\aut(P)$ and integrate to
global Lie group extensions.
