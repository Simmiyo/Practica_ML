Mixed metric 3-contact manifolds and paraquaternionic Kähler manifolds
We study manifolds endowed with mixed metric 3--contact structures, proving
that the distribution spanned by the Reeb vector fields is integrable, with
totally geodesic integral manifolds, of constant sectional curvature $k=\pm1$.
We also prove a result of projectability of such structures onto
paraquaternionic K\"ahlerian structures.
