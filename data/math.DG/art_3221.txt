Jacobi fields and the stability of minimal foliations of arbitrary
  codimension
In this article, we investigate the stability of leaves of minimal foliations
of arbitrary codimension. We also study relations between Jacobi fields and
vector fields which preserves a foliation and we use these results to Killing
fields.
