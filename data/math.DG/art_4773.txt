Symplectic analog of Calabi's conjecture for Calabi--Yau threefolds
In this paper we state an analog of Calabi's conjecture proved by Yau. The
difference with the classical case is that we propose deformation of the
complex structure, whereas the complex Monge--Amp\`{e}re equation describes
deformation of the K\"{a}hler (symplectic) structure.
