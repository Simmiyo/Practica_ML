An Extension of Barta's Theorem and Geometric Applications
We prove an extension of a theorem of Barta then we make few geometric
applications. We extend Cheng's lower eigenvalue estimates of normal geodesic
balls. We generalize Cheng-Li-Yau eigenvalue estimates of minimal submanifolds
of the space forms. We prove an stability theorem for minimal hypersurfaces of
the Euclidean space, giving a converse statement of a result of Schoen. Finally
we prove a generalization of a result of Kazdan-Kramer about existence of
solutions of certain quasi-linear elliptic equations.
