Riemann surfaces with boundary and natural triangulations of the
  Teichmueller space
We compare some natural triangulations of the Teichm\"uller space of
hyperbolic surfaces with geodesic boundary and of some bordifications. We adapt
Scannell-Wolf's proof to show that grafting semi-infinite cylinders at the ends
of hyperbolic surfaces with fixed boundary lengths is a homeomorphism. This
way, we construct a family of triangulations of the Teichm\"uller space of
punctures surfaces that interpolates between Penner-Bowditch-Epstein's (using
the spine construction) and Harer-Mumford-Thurston's (using Strebel's
differentials). Finally, we show (adapting arguments of Dumas) that on a fixed
punctured surface, when the triangulation approaches HMT's, the associated
Strebel differential is well-approximated by the Schwarzian of the associated
projective structure and by the Hopf differential of the collapsing map.
