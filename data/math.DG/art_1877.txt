A nonlinear Poisson transform for Einstein metrics on product spaces
We consider the Einstein deformations of the reducible rank two symmetric
spaces of noncompact type. If $M$ is the product of any two real, complex,
quaternionic or octonionic hyperbolic spaces, we prove that the family of
nearby Einstein metrics is parametrized by certain new geometric structures on
the Furstenberg boundary of $M$.
