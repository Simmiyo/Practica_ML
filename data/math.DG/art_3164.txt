Global Existence for the Seiberg-Witten Flow
We introduce the gradient flow of the Seiberg-Witten functional on a compact,
orientable Riemannian 4-manifold and show the global existence of a unique
smooth solution to the flow. The flow converges uniquely in $C^\infty$ up to
gauge to a critical point of the Seiberg-Witten functional.
