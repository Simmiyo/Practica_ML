Triunduloids: Embedded constant mean curvature surfaces with three ends
  and genus zero
In 1841, Delaunay constructed the embedded surfaces of revolution with
constant mean curvature (CMC); these unduloids have genus zero and are now
known to be the only embedded CMC surfaces with two ends and finite genus.
Here, we construct the complete family of embedded CMC surfaces with three ends
and genus zero; they are classified using their asymptotic necksizes. We work
in a class slightly more general than embedded surfaces, namely immersed
surfaces which bound an immersed three-manifold, as introduced by Alexandrov.
