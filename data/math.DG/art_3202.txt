Gauge Deformations and Embedding Theorems for Special Geometries
We reduce the embedding problem for hypo SU(2) and SU(3)-structures to the
embedding problem for hypo G2-structures into parallel Spin(7)-manifolds. The
latter will be described in terms of gauge deformations. This description
involves the intrinsic torsion of the initial G2-structure and allows us to
prove that the evolution equations, for all of the above embedding problems, do
not admit non-trivial longtime solutions.
