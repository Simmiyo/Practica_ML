Capacity on Finsler Spaces
Here, the concept of electric capacity on Finsler spaces is introduced and
the fundamental conformal invariant property is proved, i.e. the capacity of a
compact set on a connected non-compact Finsler manifold is conformal invariant.
This work enables mathematicians and theoretical physicists to become more
familiar with the global Finsler geometry and one of its new applications.
