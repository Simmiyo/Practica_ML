Biharmonic submanifolds with parallel mean curvature vector field in
  spheres
We present some results on the boundedness of the mean curvature of proper
biharmonic submanifolds in spheres. A partial classification result for proper
biharmonic submanifolds with parallel mean curvature vector field in spheres is
obtained. Then, we completely classify the proper biharmonic submanifolds in
spheres with parallel mean curvature vector field and parallel Weingarten
operator associated to the mean curvature vector field.
