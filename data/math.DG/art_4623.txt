Taut Submanifolds and Foliations
We give an equivalent description of taut submanifolds of complete Riemannian
manifolds as exactly those submanifolds whose normal exponential map has the
property that every preimage of a point is a union of submanifolds. It turns
out that every taut submanifold is also $\mathbb Z_2$-taut. We explicitely
construct generalized Bott-Samelson cycles for the critical points of the
energy functionals on the path spaces of a taut submanifold which, generically,
represent a basis for the $\mathbb Z_2$-cohomology. We also consider singular
Riemannian foliations all of whose leaves are taut. Using our characterization
of taut submanifolds, we are able to show that tautness of a singular
Riemannian foliation is actually a property of the quotient.
