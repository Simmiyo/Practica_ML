Ricci flow on quasiprojective manifolds
We consider the Kaehler-Ricci flow on complete finite-volume metrics that
live on the complement of a divisor in a compact Kaehler manifold X. Assuming
certain spatial asymptotics on the initial metric, we compute the singularity
time in terms of cohomological data on X. We also give a sufficient condition
for the singularity, if there is one, to be type-II.
