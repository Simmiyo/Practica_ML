The G_2 sphere over a 4-manifold
We present a construction of a canonical G_2 structure on the unit sphere
tangent bundle S_M of any given orientable Riemannian 4-manifold M. Such
structure is never geometric or 1-flat, but seems full of other possibilities.
We start by the study of the most basic properties of our construction. The
structure is co-calibrated if, and only if, M is an Einstein manifold. The
fibres are always associative. In fact, the associated 3-form results from a
linear combination of three other volume 3-forms, one of which is the volume of
the fibres. We also give new examples of co-calibrated structures on well known
spaces. We hope this contributes both to the knowledge of special geometries
and to the study of 4-manifolds.
