Polygons of the Lorentzian plane and spherical simplexes
It is known that the space of convex polygons in the Euclidean plane with
fixed normals, up to homotheties and translations, endowed with the area form,
is isometric to a hyperbolic polyhedron. In this note we show a class of convex
polygons in the Lorentzian plane such that their moduli space, if the normals
are fixed and endowed with a suitable area, is isometric to a spherical
polyhedron. These polygons have an infinite number of vertices, are space-like,
contained in the future cone of the origin, and setwise invariant under the
action of a linear isometry.
