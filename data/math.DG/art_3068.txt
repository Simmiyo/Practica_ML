Affine deformations of a three-holed sphere
Associated to every complete affine 3-manifold M with nonsolvable fundamental
group is a noncompact hyperbolic surface S. We classify such complete affine
structures when Sigma is homeomorphic to a three-holed sphere. In particular,
for every such complete hyperbolic surface Sigma, the deformation space
identifies with two opposite octants in R^3. Furthermore every M admits a
fundamental polyhedron bounded by crooked planes. Therefore M is homeomorphic
to an open solid handlebody of genus two. As an explicit application of this
theory, we construct proper affine deformations of an arithmetic Fuchsian group
inside Sp(4,Z).
