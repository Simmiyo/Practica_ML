Some comparison theorems for Kahler manifolds
In this work, we will verify some comparison results on Kahler manifolds.
They are complex Hessian comparison for the distance function from a closed
complex submanifold of a Kahler manifold with holomorphic bisectional curvature
bounded below by a constant, eigenvalue comparison and volume comparison in
terms of scalar curvature. This work is motivated by comparison results of Li
and Wang .
