Minimal disks bounded by three straight lines in Euclidean space and
  trinoids in hyperbolic space
Following Riemann's idea, we prove the existence of a minimal disk in
Euclidean space bounded by three lines in generic position and with three
helicoidal ends of angles less than $\pi$. In the case of general angles, we
prove that there exist at most four such minimal disks, we give a sufficient
condition of existence in terms of a system of three equations of degree 2, and
we give explicit formulas for the Weierstrass data in terms of hypergeometric
functions. Finally, we construct constant-mean-curvature-one trinoids in
hyperbolic space by the method of the conjugate cousin immersion.
