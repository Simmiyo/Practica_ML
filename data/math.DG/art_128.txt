On symplectically aspherical manifolds with nontrivial pi_2
We construct closed symplectic manifolds for which spherical classes generate
arbitrarily large subspaces in 2-homology, such that the first Chern class and
cohomology class of the symplectic form both vanish on all spherical classes.
We construct both Kaehler and non-Kaehler examples, and show independence of
the conditions that these two cohomology classes vanish on spherical homology.
In particular, we show that the symplectic form can pair trivially with all
spherical classes even when the Chern class pairs nontrivially.
