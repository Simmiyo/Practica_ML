Differential as a harmonic morphism with respect to Cheeger--Gromoll
  type metrics
We investigate horizontal conformality of a differential of a map between
Riemannian manifolds where the tangent bundles are equipped with
Cheeger--Gromoll type metrics. As a corollary, we characterize the differential
of a map as a harmonic morphism.
