Pfaffian Systems from Twistor Fibrations
Canonical twistor fibrations lead to Pfaffian systems by means of their
superhorizontal distribution. The aim of this note is to identify explicitly
the Pfaffian systems of five or less variables that arise in this way in terms
of the classification given by A.Awane and M.Goze.
