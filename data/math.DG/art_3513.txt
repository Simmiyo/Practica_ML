Riemann-Lagrange Geometric Dynamics for the Multi-Time Magnetized
  Non-Viscous Plasma
In this paper, using Riemann-Lagrange geometrical methods, we construct a
geometrical model on 1-jet spaces for the study of multi-time relativistic
magnetized non-viscous plasma, characterized by a given energy-stress-momentum
distinguished (d-) tensor. In that arena, we give the conservation laws and the
continuity equations for multi-time plasma. The partial differential equations
of the stream sheets (the equivalent of stream lines in the classical
semi-Riemannian geometrical approach of plasma) for multi-time plasma are also
written.
