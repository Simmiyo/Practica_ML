Evolution equations for special Lagrangian 3-folds in C^3
This is the third in a series of papers constructing explicit examples of
special Lagrangian submanifolds in C^m. The previous paper in the series,
math.DG/0008155, defined the idea of evolution data, which includes an
(m-1)-submanifold P in R^n, and constructed a family of special Lagrangian
m-folds N in C^m, which are swept out by the image of P under a 1-parameter
family of linear or affine maps phi_t : R^n -> C^m, satisfying a first-order
o.d.e. in t.
  In this paper we use the same idea to construct special Lagrangian 3-folds in
C^3. We find a 1-1 correspondence between sets of evolution data with m=3 and
homogeneous symplectic 2-manifolds P. This enables us to write down several
interesting sets of evolution data, and so to construct corresponding families
of special Lagrangian 3-folds in C^3.
  Our main results are a number of new families of special Lagrangian 3-folds
in C^3, which we write very explicitly in parametric form. Generically these
are nonsingular as immersed 3-submanifolds, and diffeomorphic to R^3 or S^1 x
R^2. Some of the 3-folds are singular, and we describe their singularities,
which we believe are of a new kind.
  We hope these 3-folds will be helpful in understanding singularities of
compact special Lagrangian 3-folds in Calabi-Yau 3-folds. This will be
important in resolving the SYZ conjecture in Mirror Symmetry.
