Images of Harmonic Maps with Symmetry
We show that under certain symmetry, the images of complete harmonic
embeddings from the complex plane into the hyperbolic plane is completely
determined by the geometric information of the vertical measured foliation and
is independent of the horizontal measured foliation of the corresponding Hopf
differentials.
