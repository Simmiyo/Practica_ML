A note on the uniqueness of quasi-Einstein metrics on $\Bbb{H}^{n}\times
  \Bbb{R}$
The aim of this note is to give an explicit description of quasi-Einstein
metrics on $\Bbb{H}^{n}\times \Bbb{R}.$ We shall construct two examples of
quasi-Einstein metrics on this manifold and then we shall prove the uniqueness
of these examples. Finally, we shall describe the closed relation between
quasi-Einstein metrics and static metrics in the quoted space.
