Harmonic Functions on Manifolds with Nonnegative Ricci Curvature and
  Linear Volume Growth
Lower bounds on Ricci curvature limit the volumes of sets and the existence
of harmonic functions on Riemannian manifolds. In 1975, Shing Tung Yau proved
that a complete noncompact manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature has no
nonconstant harmonic functions of sublinear growth. In the same paper, Yau used
this result to prove that a complete noncompact manifold with nonnegative Ricci
curvature has at least linear volume growth. In this paper, we prove the
following theorem concerning harmonic functions on these manifolds.
  Theorem: Let M be a complete noncompact manifold with nonnegative Ricci
curvature and at most linear volume growth. If there exists a nonconstant
harmonic function, f, of polynomial growth of any given degree q, then the
manifold splits isometrically, M= N x R.
