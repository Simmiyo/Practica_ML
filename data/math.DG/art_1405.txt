On manifolds with quadratic curvature decay
We give conditions which imply that a complete noncompact manifold with
quadratic curvature decay has finite topological type. In particular, we find
links between the topology of a manifold with quadractic curvature decay and
some properties of the asymptotic cones of such a manifold.
