Hypersurfaces and Codazzi tensors
In this paper we deal with the following problem: Find all Riemannian metrics
on a manifold that can be realized isometrically as immersed hypersurfaces in
the Euclidean space. We study this problem for a wide class of metrics on
hypersurfaces arising from Codazzi tensors.
