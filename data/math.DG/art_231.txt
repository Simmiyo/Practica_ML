Reduction of Sasakian manifolds
We show that the contact reduction can be specialized to Sasakian manifolds.
We link this Sasakian reduction to K\"ahler reduction by considering the
K\"ahler cone over a Sasakian manifold. We present examples of Sasakian
manifolds obtained by $S^1$ reduction of standard Sasakian spheres.
