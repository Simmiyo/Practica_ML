Intrinsic characteristic classes for a local Lie group
For a local Lie group M we define odd order cohomology classes. The first
class is an obstruction to globalizability of the local Lie group. The third
class coincides with Godbillon-Vey class in a particular case. These classes
are secondary as they emerge when curvature vanishes.
