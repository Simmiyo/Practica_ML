Lower bounds of the Dirac eigenvalues on compact Riemannian spin
  manifolds with locally product structure
We study some similarities between almost product Riemannian structures and
almost Hermitian structures. Inspired by the similarities, we prove lower
eigenvalue estimates for the Dirac operator on compact Riemannian spin
manifolds with locally product structures. We also provide some examples
(limiting manifolds) for the limiting case of the estimates.
