Properly Discontinuous Isometric Actions on the Unit Sphere of Infinite
  Dimensional Hilbert Spaces
We study the properly discontinuous and isometric actions on the unit sphere
of infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces and we get some new examples of Hilbert
manifold with costant positive sectional curvature. We prove some necessary
conditions for a group to act isometrically and properly discontinuously and in
the case of finitely generated Abelian groups, the necessary and sufficient
conditions are given.
