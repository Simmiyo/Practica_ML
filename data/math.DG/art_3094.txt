Lindelöf's theorem for catenoids revisited
In this paper we study the maximal stable domains on minimal catenoids in
Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces and in $H^2 \times R$. We in particular
investigate whether half-vertical catenoids are maximal stable domains
(\emph{Lindel\"of's property}). We also consider stable domains on
catenoid-cousins in hyperbolic space. Our motivations come from Lindel\"of's
1870 paper on catenoids in Euclidean space.
