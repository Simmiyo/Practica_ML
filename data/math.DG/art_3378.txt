Spinorial Characterizations of Surfaces into 3-dimensional
  pseudo-Riemannian Space Forms
We give a spinorial characterization of isometrically immersed surfaces of
arbitrary signature into 3-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian space forms. For
Lorentzian surfaces, this generalizes a recent work of the first author in
$\mathbb{R}^{2,1}$ to other Lorentzian space forms. We also characterize
immersions of Riemannian surfaces in these spaces. From this we can deduce
analogous results for timelike immersions of Lorentzian surfaces in space forms
of corresponding signature, as well as for spacelike and timelike immersions of
surfaces of signature (0,2), hence achieving a complete spinorial description
for this class of pseudo-Riemannian immersions.
