Turbiner's Conjecture in Three Dimensions
We prove a modified version of Turbiner's conjecture in three dimensions and
we give a counter-example to the original conjecture. The Lie algebraic
Schr\"odinger operators corresponding to flat metrics of a certain restricted
type are shown to separate partially in either Cartesian, cylindrical or
spherical coordinates.
