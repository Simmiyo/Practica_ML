Sequences of embedded minimal disks whose curvatures blow up on a
  prescribed subset of a line
For any prescribed closed subset of a line segment in Euclidean 3-space, we
construct a sequence of minimal disks that are properly embedded in an open
solid cylinder around the segment and that have curvatures blowing up precisely
at the points of the closed set.
