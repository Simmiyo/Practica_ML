Geometric realizations of generalized algebraic curvature operators
We study the 8 natural GL equivariant geometric realization questions for the
space of generalized algebraic curvature tensors. All but one of them is
solvable; a non-zero projectively flat Ricci antisymmetric generalized
algebraic curvature is not geometrically realizable by a projectively flat
Ricci antisymmetric torsion free connection.
