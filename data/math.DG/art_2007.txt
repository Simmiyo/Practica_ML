Curve shortening and the topology of closed geodesics on surfaces
We study "flat knot types" of geodesics on compact surfaces M^2. For every
flat knot type and any Riemannian metric g we introduce a Conley index
associated with the curve shortening flow on the space of immersed curves on
M^2. We conclude existence of closed geodesics with prescribed flat knot types,
provided the associated Conley index is nontrivial.
