Hyper-symplectic structures on integrable systems
We prove that an integrable system over a symplectic manifold, whose
symplectic form is covariantly constant w.r.t. the Gauss-Manin connection,
carries a natural hyper-symplectic structure. Moreover, a special Kaehler
structure is induced on the base manifold.
