Scattering theory for geometrically finite groups
We develop a geometric scattering theory for a geometrically finite group
acting on (a vector bundle over) a symmetric space of negative curvature. In
particular, we obtain the meromorphic continuation of Eisenstein series and
scattering matrices and their functional equations.
