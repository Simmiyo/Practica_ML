On the $L^{1}$-Liouville property of stochastically incomplete manifolds
A classical result by Alexander Grigor'yan states that on a stochastically
complete manifold the non-negative superharmonic $L^1$-functions are
necessarily constant. In this paper we address the question of whether and to
what extent the reverse implication holds.
