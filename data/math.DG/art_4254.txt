The Kähler-Ricci flow on projective bundles
We study the behaviour of the K\"ahler-Ricci flow on projective bundles. We
show that if the initial metric is in a suitable K\"ahler class, then the
fibers collapse in finite time and the metrics converge subsequentially in the
Gromov-Hausdorff sense to a metric on the base.
