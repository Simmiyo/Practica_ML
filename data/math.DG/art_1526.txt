The Hijazi inequality on manifolds with boundary
In this paper, we prove the Hijazi inequality on compact Riemannian spin
manifolds under two boundary conditions: the condition associated with a
chirality operator and the Riemannian version of the $\MIT$ bag condition. We
then show that the limiting-case is characterized as being a half-sphere for
the first condition whereas the equality cannot be achieved for the second.
