Orbifold homeomorphism finiteness based on geometric constraints
We show that any collection of n-dimensional orbifolds with sectional
curvature and volume uniformly bounded below, diameter bounded above, and with
only isolated singular points contains orbifolds of only finitely many orbifold
homeomorphism types. This is a generalization to the orbifold category of a
similar result for manifolds proven by Grove, Petersen, and Wu. It follows that
any Laplace isospectral collection of orbifolds with sectional curvature
uniformly bounded below and having only isolated singular points also contains
only finitely many orbifold homeomorphism types. The main steps of the argument
are to show that any sequence from the collection has subsequence that
converges to an orbifold, and then to show that the homeomorphism between the
underlying spaces of the limit orbifold and an orbifold from the subsequence
that is guaranteed by Perelman's stability theorem must preserve orbifold
structure.
