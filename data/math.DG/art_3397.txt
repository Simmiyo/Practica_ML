A note about invariant SKT structures and generalized Kahler structures
  on flag manifolds
We prove that any invariant strong Kahler structure with torsion (SKT
structure) on a flag manifold M=G/K of a semisimple compact Lie group G is
Kahler. As an application we describe invariant generalized Kahler structures
on M.
