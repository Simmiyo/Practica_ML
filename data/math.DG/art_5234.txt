A simple construction of generalized complex manifolds
We construct a natural generalized complex structure on the total space of
any bundle endowed with a Chern connection and whose typical fibre is a
homogeneous symplectic manifold. This extends known constructions of
generalized complex structures on Lie groups and leads to natural examples of
holomorphic maps between generalized complex manifolds.
