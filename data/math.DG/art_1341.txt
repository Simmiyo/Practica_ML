Conformal Anomalies via Canonical Traces
Using Laurent expansions of the Kontsevich-Vishik canonical trace of
holomorphic families of classical pseudodifferential operators, we define
functionals on the space of Riemannian metrics and investigate their conformal
properties, thereby giving a unified description of several conformal
invariants and anomalies.
