Differential Invariants of SL(2) and SL(3)-ACTIONS on R^2
The main purpose of this paper is calculation of differential invariants
which arise from prolonged actions of two Lie groups SL(2) and SL(3) on the
$n$th jet space of $R^2$. It is necessary to calculate $n$th prolonged
infenitesimal generators of the action.
