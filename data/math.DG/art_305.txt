Isothermic surfaces: conformal geometry, Clifford algebras and
  integrable systems
We give an account of the classical and integrable geometry of isothermic
surfaces in arbitrary co-dimension. We show that the classical transformation
theory of Darboux, Bianchi and Calapso goes through unchanged in arbitrary
co-dimension as does the connection with the "curved flats" of Ferus and Pedit.
Moreover, we identify Darboux transformations with the dressing action of
"simple factors" in the sense of Terng and Uhlenbeck. In so doing, we advertise
the use of Vahlen's Clifford algebra matrices as an efficient computational
tool in conformal geometry.
