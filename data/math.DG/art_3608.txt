Harmonic Complex Structures
In this paper, we introduce a new concept so called harmonic complex
structure by using harmonic theory for vector bundle-valued differential forms.
It is a new structure intermediates between complex structure and K\"ahler
structure. From differential geometric viewpoint, it is a natural
generalization of K\"ahler structure.
