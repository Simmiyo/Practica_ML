A Neumann Type Maximum Principle for the Laplace Operator on Compact
  Riemannian Manifolds
In this paper we present a proof of a Neumann type maximum principle for the
Laplace operator on compact Riemannian manifolds. A key p oint is the simple
geometric nature of the constant in the a priori estimate of this maximum
principle. In particular, this maximum principle can be applied to manifolds
with Ricci curvature bounded from below and diameter bounded from above to
yield a maximum estimate without dependence on a positive lower bound for the
volume.
