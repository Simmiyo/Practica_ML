From spatially periodic instantons to singular monopoles
The main result is a computation of the Nahm transform of a SU(2)-instanton
over RxT^3, called spatially-periodic instanton. It is a singular monopole over
T^3, a solution to the Bogomolny equation, whose rank is computed and behavior
at the singular points is described.
