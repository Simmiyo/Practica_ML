A new proof of a characterization of small spherical caps
It is known that planar disks and small spherical caps are the only constant
mean curvature graphs whose boundary is a round circle. Usually, the proof
invokes the Maximum Principle for elliptic equations. This paper presents a new
proof of this result motivated by an article due to Reilly. Our proof utilizes
a flux formula for surfaces with constant mean curvature together with integral
equalities on the surface.
