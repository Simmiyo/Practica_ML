Burghelea-Friedlander-Kappeler's gluing formula for the zeta-determinant
  and its applications to the adiabatic decompositions of the zeta-determinant
  and the analytic torsion
The gluing formula of the zeta-determinant of a Laplacian given by Burghelea,
Friedlander and Kappeler contains an unknown constant. In this paper we compute
this constant to complete the formula under the assumption of the product
structure near boundary. As applications of this result,we prove the adiabatic
decomposition theorems of the zeta-determinant of a Laplacian with respect to
the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions and of the analytic torsion with
respect to the absolute and relative boundary conditions.
