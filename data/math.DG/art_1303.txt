On projective group properties of the $6D$ pseudo-Riemannian space
We study the six-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian spaces with two time-like
coordinates that admit non-homothetic infinitesimal projective transformations.
The metrics are manifestly obtained and the projective group properties are
determined. We also find a generic defining of projective motion in the
6-dimensional rigid h-space.
