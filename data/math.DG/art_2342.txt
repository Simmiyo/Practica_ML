A class of variational functionals in conformal geometry
We derive a class of variational functionals which arise naturally in
conformal geometry. In the special case when the Riemannian manifold is locally
conformal flat, the functional coincides with the well studied functional which
is the integration over the manifold of the k-symmetric function of the
Schouten tensor of the metric on the manifold.
