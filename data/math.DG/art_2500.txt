Index and nullity of the Gauss map of the Costa-Hoffman-Meeks surfaces
The aim of this work is to extend the results of S. Nayatani about the index
and the nullity of the Gauss map of the Costa-Hoffman-Meeks surfaces for values
of the genus bigger than 37. That allows us to state that these minimal
surfaces are non degenerate for all the values of the genus in the sense of the
definition of J. Perez and A. Ros.
