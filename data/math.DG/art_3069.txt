Position vectors of slant helices in Euclidean space E$^3$
In classical differential geometry, the problem of the determination of the
position vector of an arbitrary space curve according to the intrinsic
equations $\kappa=\kappa(s)$ and $\tau=\tau(s)$ (where $\kappa$ and $\tau$ are
the curvature and torsion of the space curve $\psi$, respectively) is still
open \cite{eisenh, lips}. However, in the case of a plane curve, helix and
general helix, this problem is solved. In this paper, we solved this problem in
the case of a slant helix. Also, we applied this method to find the
representation of a Salkowski, anti-Salkowski curves and a curve of constant
precession, as examples of a slant helices, by means of intrinsic equations.
