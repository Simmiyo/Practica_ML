Families of conformal tori of revolution in the 3-sphere
For all positive integers n we construct a 1-parameter family of conformal
tori of revolution in the 3-sphere with n bulges. These tori arise by Darboux
transformations of constant mean curvature tori but do not have constant mean
curvature in the 3-sphere.
