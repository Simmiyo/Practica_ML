Harmonic tori and their spectral data
This is an expository article which describes one approach to the
construction and classification of harmonic tori "of finite type", namely, via
their ring of polynomial Killing fields. To keep the discussion focussed, the
first section is devoted entirely to non-conformal harmonic tori in the
2-sphere. The second section summarizes the authors more recent work on
pluri-harmonic maps into complex Grassmannians.
