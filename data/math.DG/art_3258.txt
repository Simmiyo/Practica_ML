A family of Einstein Randers metrics
Using Hawking Taub-NUT metric $g_a$ on $\mathbf{R}^4$, where $a$ is a
positive real number and finding a 4-parameter family of Killing vector fields
of $(\mathbf{R}^4,g_a)$, we construct a 5-parameter family of Einstein Randers
metrics with non-constant flag curvature.
