Hardy spaces of differential forms on Riemannian manifolds
Let $M$ be a complete connected Riemannian manifold. Assuming that the
Riemannian measure is doubling, we define Hardy spaces $H^p$ of differential
forms on $M$ and give various characterizations of them, including an atomic
decomposition. As a consequence, we derive the $H^p$-boundedness for Riesz
transforms on $M$, generalizing previously known results. Further applications,
in particular to $H^{\infty}$ functional calculus and Hodge decomposition, are
given.
