Generalized Mannheim Curves in Minkowski space-time $E_1^4$
In this paper, the definition of generalized spacelike Mannheim curve in
Minkowski space-time $E_1^4$ is given. The necessary and sufficient conditions
for the generalized spacelike Mannheim curve are obtained. Also, some
characterizations of Mannheim curve are given.
