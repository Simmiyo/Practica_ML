Classification of the solutions to an overdetermined problem in the
  plane
We classify the solutions to an overdetermined elliptic problem in the plane
in the finite connectivity case. This is achieved by establishing a one-to-one
correspondence between the solutions to this problem and a certain type of
minimal surfaces.
