On causality and closed geodesics of compact Lorentzian manifolds and
  static spacetimes
Some results related to the causality of compact Lorentzian manifolds are
proven: (1) any compact Lorentzian manifold which admits a timelike conformal
vector field is totally vicious, and (2) a compact Lorentzian manifold covered
regularly by a globally hyperbolic spacetime admits a timelike closed geodesic,
if some natural topological assumptions (fulfilled, for example, if one of the
conjugacy classes of deck transformations containing a closed timelike curve is
finite) hold. As a consequence, any compact Lorentzian manifold conformal to a
static spacetime is geodesically connected by causal geodesics, and admits a
timelike closed geodesic.
