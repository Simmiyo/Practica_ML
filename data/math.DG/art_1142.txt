The Positive Mass Conjecture for Non-spin Manifolds
We extend Witten's spinor proof of the positive mass theorem to large classes
of complete asymptotically flat non-spin manifolds, including all manifolds of
dimension less than or equal to 11 and all manifolds of dimension less than 26
which admit a codimension 3 immersion in Euclidean space.
