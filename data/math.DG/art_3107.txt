Totally umbilical disks and applications to surfaces in
  three-dimensional homogeneous spaces
Following ideas of Choe and Fernandez-do Carmo, we give sufficient conditions
for a disk type surface, with piecewise smooth boundary, to be totally
umbilical for a given Coddazi pair. As a consequence, we obtain rigidity
results for surfaces in space forms and in homogeneous product spaces that
generalizes some known results.
