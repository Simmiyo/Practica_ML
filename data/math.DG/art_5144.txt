On CR (Cauchy-Riemann) almost cosymplectic manifolds
In the paper we develop a framework for the alternative way of the study of a
local geometry of almost cosymplectic manifolds with Kahlerian leaves. The main
idea is to apply the concept of a geometry and analysis of CR manifolds.
Locally the almost cosymplectic manifold is modeled on the 'mixed' space RxCn.
There is given a complete local description of the underlying almost contact
metric structure in the system of local, mixed - real, complex- coordinates. We
also introduce a notion of a canonical Hermitian complex connection in the CR
structure of a CR almost cosymplectic manifold. As an example we provide
detailed descritpion of almost cosymplectic $(-1,\mu,0)$-spaces.
