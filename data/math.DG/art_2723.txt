Proper isometric actions
We prove the following to results: (1) A subgroup G of the isometry group of
a Riemannian manifold M acts properly on M if and only if G is closed in the
isometry group of M. (2) The orbits of an isometric action are closed if and
only if the action is orbit equivalent to a proper isometric action.
