On a new construction of special Lagrangian immersions in complex
  Euclidean space
We construct new special Lagrangian submanifolds in complex Euclidean space
using a pair of minimal Legendrian submanifolds in odd-dimensional spheres and
certain Lagrangian surface belonging to a family that can be considered as a
generalization of the special Lagrangian surfaces in complex Euclidean plane.
Our examples include those invariant under the standard action of
SO(p+1)xSO(q+1) on C^n = C^(p+1) x C^(q+1), n=p+q+2.
