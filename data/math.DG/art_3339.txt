Local Bianchi Identities in the Relativistic Non-Autonomous Lagrange
  Geometry
The aim of this paper is to describe the local Bianchi identities for an
$h$-normal $\Gamma$-linear connection of Cartan type $\nabla\Gamma$ on the
first-order jet space $J^1(R,M)$. In this direction, we present the local
expressions of the adapted components of the torsion and curvature d-tensors
produced by $\nabla\Gamma$ and we give the general local expressions of Bianchi
identities which connect these d-torsions and d-curvatures.
