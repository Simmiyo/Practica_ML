A generalization of Rado's Theorem for almost graphical boundaries
In this paper, we prove a generalization of Rado's Theorem, a fundamental
result of minimal surface theory, which says that minimal surfaces over a
convex domain with graphical boundaries must be disks which are themselves
graphical. We will show that, for a minimal surface of any genus, whose
boundary is "almost graphical" in some sense, that the surface must be
graphical once we move sufficiently far from the boundary.
