Causal geometries, null geodesics, and gravity
The authors study a generalized notion of null geodesic defined by the
Legendrian dynamics of a regular conical subbundle of the tangent bundle on a
manifold. A natural extension of the Weyl tensor is shown to exist, and to
depend only on this conical subbundle. Given a suitable defining function of
the conical bundle, the Raychaudhuri--Sachs equations of general relativity
continue to hold, and give rise to the same phenomenon of covergence of null
geodesics in regions of positive energy that underlies the theory of
gravitation.
