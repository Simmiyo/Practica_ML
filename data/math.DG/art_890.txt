Degeneration of Kahler-Einstein hypersurfaces in complex torus to
  generalized pair of pants decomposition
In this paper we show that the convergence of complete Kahler-Einstein
hypersurfaces in complex torus in the sense of Cheeger-Gromov will canonically
degenerate the underlying manifolds into "pair of pants" decomposition. We also
construct minimal Lagrangian tori that represent the vanishing cycles of the
degeneration.
