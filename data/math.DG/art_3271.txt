Isomorphism of Intransitive Linear Lie Equations
We show that formal isomorphism of intransitive linear Lie equations along
transversal to the orbits can be extended to neighborhoods of these
transversal. In analytic cases, the word formal is dropped from theorems. Also,
we associate an intransitive Lie algebra with each intransitive linear Lie
equation, and from the intransitive Lie algebra we recover the linear Lie
equation, unless of formal isomorphism. The intransitive Lie algebra gives the
structure functions introduced by E. Cartan.
