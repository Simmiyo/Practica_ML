Conformal equivalence between certain geometries in dimension 6 and 7
For G_2-manifolds the Fern\'andez-Gray class X_1+X_4 is shown to consist of
the union of the class X_4 of G_2-manifolds locally conformal to parallel
G_2-structures and that of conformal transformations of nearly parallel or weak
holonomy G_2-manifolds of type X_1. The analogous conclusion is obtained for
Gray-Hervella class W_1+W_4 of real 6-dimensional almost Hermitian manifolds:
this sort of geometry consists of locally conformally K\"ahler manifolds of
class W_4 and conformal transformations of nearly K\"ahler manifolds in class
W_1. A corollary of this is that a compact SU(3)-space in class W_1+W_4 or
G_2-space of the kind X_1+X_4 has constant scalar curvature if only if it is
either a standard sphere or a nearly parallel G_2 or nearly K\"ahler manifold,
respectively. The properties of the Riemannian curvature of the spaces under
consideration are also explored.
