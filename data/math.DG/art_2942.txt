Certain Constant Angle Surfaces Constructed on Curves
In this paper we classify certain special ruled surfaces in $\R^3$ under the
general theorem of characterization of constant angle surfaces. We study the
tangent developable and conical surfaces from the point of view the constant
angle property. Moreover, the natural extension to normal and binormal constant
angle surfaces is given.
