Circle-preserving transformations in Finsler spaces
Here, by extending the definition of circle to Finsler geometry, we show
that, every circle-preserving local diffeomorphism is conformal. This result
implies that in Finsler geometry, the definition of concircular change of
metrics, a priori, does not require the conformal assumption.
