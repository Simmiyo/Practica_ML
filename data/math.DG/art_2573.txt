Adiabatic limit, Bismut-Freed connection, and the real analytic torsion
  form
For a complex flat vector bundle over a fibered manifold, we consider the
1-parameter family of certain deformed sub-signature operators introduced by
Ma-Zhang. We compute the adiabatic limit of the Bismut-Freed connection
associated to this family and show that the Bismut-Lott analytic torsion form
shows up naturally under this procedure.
