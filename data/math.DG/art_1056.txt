The Ribaucour transformation in Lie sphere geometry
We discuss the Ribaucour transformation of Legendre maps in Lie sphere
geometry. In this context, we give a simple conceptual proof of Bianchi's
original Permutability Theorem and its generalisation by Dajczer--Tojeiro. We
go on to formulate and prove a higher dimensional version of the Permutability
Theorem. It is shown how these theorems descend to the corresponding results
for submanifolds in space forms.
