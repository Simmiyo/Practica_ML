The Weil-Petersson geometry of the five-times punctured sphere
We give a new proof that the completion of the Weil-Petersson metric on
Teichm\"uller space is Gromov-hyperbolic if the surface is a five-times
punctured sphere or a twice-punctured torus. Our methods make use of the
synthetic geometry of the Weil-Petersson metric.
