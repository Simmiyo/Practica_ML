Crossed modules and the integrability of Lie brackets
We show that the integrability obstruction of a transitive Lie algebroid
coincides with the lifting obstruction of a crossed module of groupoids
associated naturally with the given algebroid. Then we extend this result to
general extensions of integrable transitive Lie algebroids by Lie algebra
bundles. Such a lifting obstruction is directly related with the classification
of extensions of transitive Lie groupoids. We also give a classification of
such extensions which differentiates to the classification of transitive Lie
algebroids discussed in \cite{KCHM:new}.
