Bounding sectional curvature along a Kähler-Ricci flow
If a normalized K\"{a}hler-Ricci flow $g(t),t\in[0,\infty),$ on a compact
K\"{a}hler $n$-manifold, $n\geq 3$, of positive first Chern class satisfies
$g(t)\in 2\pi c_{1}(M)$ and has $L^{n}$ curvature operator uniformly bounded,
then the curvature operator will also uniformly bounded along the flow.
Consequently the flow will converge along a subsequence to a K\"{a}hler-Ricci
soliton.
