Flats and Submersions in Non-Negative Curvature
We find constraints on the extent to which O'Neill's horizontal curvature
equation can be used to create positive curvature on the base space of a
Riemannian submersion. In particular, we study when K. Tapp's theorem on
Riemannian submersions of compact Lie groups with bi-invariant metrics
generalizes to arbitrary manifolds of non-negative curvature.
