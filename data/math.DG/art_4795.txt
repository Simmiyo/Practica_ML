On isophote curve and its characterizations
Isophote comprises a locus of the surface points whose normal vectors make a
constant angle with a fixed vector. Main objective of this paper is to find the
axis of an isophote curve via its Darboux frame and afterwards to give some
characterizations about isophote and its axis. Particularly, for isophotes
lying on a canal surface will be obtained other characterizations again.
