Positive mass theorem for the Paneitz-Branson operator
We prove that under suitable assumptions, the constant term in the Green
function of the Paneitz-Branson operator on a compact Riemannian manifold
$(M,g)$ is positive unless $(M,g)$ is conformally diffeomophic to the standard
sphere. The proof is inspired by the positive mass theorem on spin manifolds by
Ammann-Humbert.
