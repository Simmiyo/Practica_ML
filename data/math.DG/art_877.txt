Varieties with Degenerate Gauss Maps with Multiple Foci and Twisted
  Cones
The authors study in detail new types of varieties with degenerate Gauss
maps: varieties with multiple foci and their particular case, the so-called
twisted cones. They prove an existence theorem for twisted cones and describe
their structure.
