Timelike Minimal Submanifolds of General Co-dimension in Minkowski
  SpaceTime
We consider the timelike minimal surface problem in Minkowski spacetimes and
show local and global existence of such surfaces having arbitrary dimension
$\geq 2$ and arbitrary co-dimension, provided they are initially close to a
flat plane.
