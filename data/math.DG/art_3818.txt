Genericity of Caustics on a corner
We introduce the notions of the caustic-equivalence and the weak
caustic-equivalence relations of reticular Lagrangian maps in order to give a
generic classification of caustics on a corner. We give the figures of all
generic caustics on a corner in a smooth manifold of dimension 2 and 3.
