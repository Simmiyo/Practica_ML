Helicoidal surfaces with constant anisotropic mean curvature
We study surfaces with constant anisotropic mean curvature which are
invariant under a helicoidal motion. For functionals with axially symmetric
Wulff shapes, we generalize the recently developed twizzler representation of
Perdomo to the anisotropic case and show how all helicoidal constant
anisotropic mean curvature surfaces can be obtained by quadratures.
