Lightlike foliations on Lorentzian manifolds with weakly irreducible
  holonomy algebra
We study the lightlike foliations that appear on Lorentzian manifolds with
weakly irreducible not irreducible holonomy algebra. We give global structure
equations for the foliation that generalize the Gauss and Weingarten equations
for one lightlike hypersurface. This gives us some global operators on the
manifold. Using these operators, we decompose the curvature tensor of the
manifold into several components. We give a criteria how to find the type of
the holonomy algebras (there are 4 possible types) in terms of the global
operators.
