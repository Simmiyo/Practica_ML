U(1)-invariant special Lagrangian 3-folds. III. Properties of singular
  solutions
This is the third in a series of three papers math.DG/0111324,
math.DG/0111326 studying special Lagrangian 3-submanifolds (SL 3-folds) N in
C^3 invariant under the U(1)-action (z_1,z_2,z_3) --> (gz_1,g^{-1}z_2,z_3) for
unit complex numbers g, using analytic methods. The three papers are surveyed
in math.DG/0206016.
  Let N be such a U(1)-invariant SL 3-fold. Then |z_1|^2-|z_2|^2=2a on N for
some real a. Locally, N can be written as a kind of graph of functions u,v :
R^2 --> R satisfying a nonlinear Cauchy-Riemann equation depending on a. When a
is nonzero, u,v are smooth and N is nonsingular. But if a=0, there may be
points (x,0) where u,v are not differentiable, corresponding to singular points
of N.
  The first paper math.DG/0111324 studied the case a nonzero, and proved
existence and uniqueness for solutions of two Dirichlet problems derived from
the nonlinear Cauchy-Riemann equation. This yields existence and uniqueness of
a large class of nonsingular U(1)-invariant SL 3-folds in C^3, with boundary
conditions.
  The second paper math.DG/0111326 extended these results to weak solutions of
the Dirichlet problems when a=0, giving existence and uniqueness of many
singular U(1)-invariant SL 3-folds in C^3, with boundary conditions.
  This third paper studies the singularities of these SL 3-folds. We show that
under mild conditions the singularities are isolated, and have a multiplicity
n>0, and one of two types. Examples are constructed with every multiplicity and
type. We also prove the existence of large families of U(1)-invariant special
Lagrangian fibrations of open sets in C^3, including singular fibres.
