P-spectrum and collapsing of connected sums, calculus of the limit
The goal of the paper is to calculate the limit sectrum of the Hodge-Laplace
operator under the perturbation of collapse of one part of a connected sum.
This gives some new results concerning the 'conformal spectrum' on differential
forms.
