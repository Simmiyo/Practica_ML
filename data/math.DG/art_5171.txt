Prescription du spectre de Steklov dans une classe conforme
On any compact manifold of dimension $n\geq3$ with boundary, we prescibe any
finite part of the Steklov spectrum whithin a given conformal class. In
particular, we prescribe the multiplicity of the first eigenvalues. On a
compact surface with boundary, we show that the multiplicity of the $k$-th
eigenvalue is bounded independently of the metric. On the disk, we give more
precise results : the multiplicity of the first and second positive eigenvalues
are at most 2 and 3 respectively. For the Steklov-Neumann problem on the disk,
we prove that the multiplicity of the $k$-th positive eigenvalue is at most
$k+1$.
