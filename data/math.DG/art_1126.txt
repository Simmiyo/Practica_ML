Desingularizations of Calabi-Yau 3-folds with a conical singularity
We study Calabi-Yau 3-folds M_0 with a conical singularity x modelled on a
Calabi-Yau cone V. We construct desingularizations of M_0, obtaining a
1-parameter family of compact, nonsingular Calabi-Yau 3-folds which has M_0 as
the limit. The way we do is to choose an Asymptotically Conical Calabi-Yau
3-fold Y modelled on the same cone V, and then glue into M_0 at x after
applying a homothety to Y. We then get a 1-parameter family of nearly
Calabi-Yau 3-folds M_t depending on a small real variable t. For sufficiently
small t, we show that the nearly Calabi-Yau structures on M_t can be deformed
to genuine Calabi-Yau structures, and therefore obtaining the
desingularizations of M_0. Our result can be applied to resolving orbifold
singularities and hence provides a quantitative description of the Calabi-Yau
metrics on the crepant resolutions.
