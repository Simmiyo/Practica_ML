Einstein metrics and Yamabe invariants of weighted projective spaces
An orbifold version of the Hitchin-Thorpe inequality is used to prove that
certain weighted projective spaces do not admit orbifold Einstein metrics.
Also, several estimates for the orbifold Yamabe invariants of weighted
projective spaces are proved.
