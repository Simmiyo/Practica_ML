On the harmonicity of normal almost contact metric structures
We consider normal almost contact structures on a Riemannian manifold and,
through their associated sections of an ad-hoc twistor bundle, study their
harmonicity, as sections or as maps. We rewrite these harmonicity equations in
terms of the Riemann curvature tensor and find conditions relating the
harmonicity of the almost contact and almost complex structures of the total
and base spaces of the Morimoto fibration.
