Connections and Curvature in sub-Riemannian geometry
For a subRiemannian manifold and a given Riemannian extension of the metric,
we define a canonical global connection. This connection coincides with both
the Levi-Civita connection on Riemannian manifolds and the Tanaka-Webster
connection on strictly pseudoconvex CR manifolds. We define a notion of
normality generalizing Tanaka's notion for CR manifolds to the subRiemannian
case. Under the assumption of normality, we construct local frames that
simplify computations in a manner analogous to Riemannian normal coordinates.
We then use these frames to establish Bianchi Identities and symmetries for the
associated curvatures. Finally we explore subRiemannian generalizations of the
Bonnet-Myers theorem, providing some new results and some new proofs and
interpretations of existing results.
