AV-Courant algebroids and generalized CR structures
We construct a generalization of Courant algebroids which are classified by
the third cohomology group $H^3(A,V)$, where $A$ is a Lie Algebroid, and $V$ is
an $A$-module. We see that both Courant algebroids and $\mathcal{E}^1(M)$
structures are examples of them. Finally we introduce generalized CR structures
on a manifold, which are a generalization of generalized complex structures,
and show that every CR structure and contact structure is an example of a
generalized CR structure.
