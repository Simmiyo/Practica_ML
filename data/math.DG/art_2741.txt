Pseudo-parallel Lagrangian submanifolds are semi-parallel
We prove a conjecture formulated by Pablo M. Chacon and Guillermo A. Lobos in
[Pseudo-parallel Lagrangian submanifolds in complex space forms, Differential
Geom. Appl.] stating that every Lagrangian pseudo-parallel submanifold of a
complex space form of dimension at least 3 is semi-parallel.
