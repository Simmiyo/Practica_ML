On Finslerized Absolute Parallelism spaces
The aim of the present paper is to construct and investigate a Finsler
structure within the framework of a Generalized Absolute Parallelism space
(GAP-space). The Finsler structure is obtained from the vector fields forming
the parallelization of the GAP-space. The resulting space, which we refer to as
a Finslerized Parallelizable space, combines within its geometric structure the
simplicity of GAP-geometry and the richness of Finsler geometry, hence is
potentially more suitable for applications and especially for describing
physical phenomena. A study of the geometry of the two structures and their
interrelation is carried out. Five connections are introduced and their torsion
and curvature tensors derived. Some special Finslerized Parallelizable spaces
are singled out. One of the main reasons to introduce this new space is that
both Absolute Parallelism and Finsler geometries have proved effective in the
formulation of physical theories, so it is worthy to try to build a more
general geometric structure that would share the benefits of both geometries.
