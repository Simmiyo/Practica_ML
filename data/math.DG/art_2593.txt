Bianchi's Bäcklund transformation for higher dimensional quadrics
We provide a generalization of Bianchi's B\"{a}cklund transformation from
2-dimensional quadrics to higher dimensional quadrics. The starting point of
our investigation is the higher dimensional (infinitesimal) version of
Bianchi's main four theorems on the theory of deformations of quadrics and
Bianchi's treatment of the B\"{a}cklund transformation for diagonal paraboloids
via conjugate systems.
