Cohomology for almost Lie algebroids
We give numerous examples of almost Lie algebroids arising as Dirac
structures in pre-Courant algebroids, e.g. from twisted Poisson structures, as
well as from twisted actions of a Lie algebra. We moreover define a cohomology
for them, motivated by a Q-structure, that is trivial for (bundles of) Lie
algebras but characterizes the underlying integrable distribution the image of
the anchor map.
