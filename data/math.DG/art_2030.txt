On the spectrum of the twisted Dolbeault Laplacian over Kähler
  manifolds
We use Dirac operator techniques to a establish sharp lower bound for the
first eigenvalue of the Dolbeault Laplacian twisted by Hermitian-Einstein
connections on vector bundles of negative degree over compact K\"ahler
manifolds.
