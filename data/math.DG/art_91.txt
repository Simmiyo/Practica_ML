L2-torsion of hyperbolic manifolds
The L^2-torsion is an invariant defined for compact L^2-acyclic manifolds of
determinant class, for example odd dimensional hyperbolic manifolds. It was
introduced by John Lott and Varghese Mathai and computed for hyperbolic
manifolds in low dimensions.
  In this paper we show that the L^2-torsion of hyperbolic manifolds of
arbitrary odd dimension does not vanish. This was conjectured by J. Lott and W.
Lueck.
  Some concrete values are computed and an estimate of their growth with the
dimension is given.
