Ricci surfaces
A Ricci surface is a Riemannian 2-manifold $(M,g)$ whose Gaussian curvature
$K$ satisfies $K\Delta K+g(dK,dK)+4K^3=0$. Every minimal surface isometrically
embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is a Ricci surface of non-positive curvature. At the
end of the 19th century Ricci-Curbastro has proved that conversely, every point
$x$ of a Ricci surface has a neighborhood which embeds isometrically in
$\mathbb{R}^3$ as a minimal surface, provided $K(x)<0$. We prove this result in
full generality by showing that Ricci surfaces can be locally isometrically
embedded either minimally in $\mathbb{R}^3$ or maximally in $\mathbb{R}^{2,1}$,
including near points of vanishing curvature. We then develop the theory of
closed Ricci surfaces, possibly with conical singularities, and construct
classes of examples in all genera $g\geq 2$.
