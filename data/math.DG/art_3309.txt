The Perron Method and the Non-Linear Plateau Problem
We describe a novel technique for solving the Plateau problem for constant
curvature hypersurfaces based on recent work of Harvey and Lawson. This is
illustrated by an existence theorem for hypersurfaces of constant Gaussian
curvature in $\Bbb{R}^{n+1}$.
