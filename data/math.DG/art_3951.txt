A short proof to the rigidity of volume entropy
In this note we give a short proof to the rigidity of volume entropy. The
result says that for a closed manifold with Ricci curvature bounded from below,
if the universal cover has maximal volume entropy, then it is the space form.
This theorem was first proved by F. Ledrappier and X. Wang in [1].
