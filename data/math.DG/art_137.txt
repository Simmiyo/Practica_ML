Nonnegative Ricci curvature, small linear diameter growth and finite
  generation of fundamental groups
In 1968, Milnor conjectured that a complete noncompact manifold with
nonnegative Ricci curvature has a finitely generated fundamental group. The
author applies the Excess Theorem of Abresch and Gromoll (1990), to prove two
theorems. The first states that if such a manifold has small linear diameter
growth then its fundamental group is finitely generated. The second states that
if such a manifold has an infinitely generated fundamental group then it has a
tangent cone at infinity which is not polar. A corollary of either theorem is
the fact that if such a manifold has linear volume growth, then its fundamental
group is finitely generated.
