On Cartan Spaces with m-th Root Metrics
In this paper, we define some non-Riemannian curvature properties for Cartan
spaces. We consider Cartan space with the m-th root metric. We prove that every
m-th root Cartan space of isotropic Landsberg curvature, or isotropic mean
Landsberg curvature, or isotropic mean Berwald curvature reduces to a
Landsberg, weakly Landsberg and weakly Berwald space, respectively. Then we
show that m-th root Cartan space of almost vanishing H-curvature satisfies H =
0.
