Mean curvature flow of higher codimension in Riemannian manifolds
We investigate the convergence of the mean curvature flow of arbitrary
codimension in Riemannian manifolds with bounded geometry. We prove that if the
initial submanifold satisfies a pinching condition, then along the mean
curvature flow the submanifold contracts smoothly to a round point in finite
time. As a consequence we obtain a differentiable sphere theorem for
submanifolds in a Riemannian manifold.
