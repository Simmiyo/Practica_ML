Diffeomorphisms of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds and the values of the
  curvature tensor on degenerate planes
A diffeomorphism of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds is called sectional curvature
preserving if it preserves the sectional curvature of all the nondegenerate
2-planes. We consider a similar condition for degenerate 2-planes and we prove
that the diffeomorphism is conformal (when the condition is fulfilled for
weakly degenerate planes) or an isometry (when the condition is fulfilled for
strongly degenerate 2-planes).
