Thread configurations for ellipsoids
We discuss Darboux-Staude type of thread configurations for the ellipsoid
similar to Chasles-Graves type of thread configurations for the ellipse. These
threads are formed by rectilinear segments, geodesic and line of curvature
segments on the considered ellipsoid and with tangents tangent to the given
ellipsoid and a fixed confocal hyperboloid with one sheet and preserve constant
length when the vertices of the configuration move on confocal ellipsoids.
