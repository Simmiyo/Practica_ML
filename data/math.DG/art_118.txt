Coherent states, line bundles and divisors
For homogeneous simply connected Hodge manifolds it is proved that the set of
coherent vectors orthogonal to a given one is the divisor responsible for the
homogeneous holomorphic line bundle of the coherent vectors. In particular, for
naturally reductive spaces, the divisor is the cut locus.
