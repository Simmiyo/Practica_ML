A note on the uniformization of gradient Kähler-Ricci solitons
Applying a well known result for attracting fixed points of biholomorphisms
\cite{RR, V}, we observe that one immediately obtains the following result: if
$(M^n,g)$ is a complete non-compact gradient K\"ahler-Ricci soliton which is
either steady with positive Ricci curvature so that the scalar curvature
attains its maximum at some point, or expanding with non-negative Ricci
curvature, then $M$ is biholomorphic to $\ce ^n$.
