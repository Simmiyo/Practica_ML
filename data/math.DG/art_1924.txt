Integral formula of Minkowski type and new characterization of the Wulff
  shape
Given a positive function F on Sn which satisfies a convexity condition, we
introduce the r-th anisotropic mean curvature Mr for hypersurfaces in Rn+1
which is a generalization of the usual r-th mean curvature Hr. We get integral
formulas of Minkowski type for compact hypersurfaces in Rn+1. We give some new
characterizations of the Wulff shape by use of our integral formulas of
Minkowski type, in case F = 1 which reduces to some well-known results.
