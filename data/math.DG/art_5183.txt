Curvature identities on almost Hermitian manifolds and applications
In this paper, we systematically compute the Bianchi identities for the
canonical connection on an almost Hermitian manifold. Moreover, we also compute
the curvature tensor of the Levi-Civita connection on almost Hermitian
manifolds in terms of curvature and torsion of the canonical connection. As
applications of the curvature identities, we obtain some results about the
integrability of quasi Kaehler manifolds and some properties of nearly Kaehler
manifolds.
