The second Yamabe invariant
Let $(M,g)$ be a compact Riemannian manifold of dimension $n \geq 3$. We
define the second Yamabe invariant as the infimum of the second eigenvalue of
the Yamabe operator over the metrics conformal to $g$ and of volume 1. We study
when it is attained. As an application, we find nodal solutions of the Yamabe
equation.
