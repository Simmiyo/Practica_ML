Reconstruction of the intertwining operator and new striking examples
  added to``Isospectral pairs of metrics on balls and spheres with different
  local geometries''
The intertwining operator constructed in [Sz1,Sz2] does not appear in the
right form. It is established there by using only the anticommutators. The
correct operator must involve all endomorphisms, which are unified by the
Z-Fourier transform. Although some of the correct elements of the previous
constructions are kept, this idea is established by a new technique which
yields the various isospectrality theorems stated in the papers on a much
larger scale. The new results include new isospectrality examples living on
sphere$X$ball- and sphere$X$sphere-type manifolds. Among them, there are such
discrete isospectrality families where one of the members is homogeneous while
the others are locally inhomogeneous (striking examples). Furthermore, a large
class of new isospectrality families are constructed by $\sigma$ deformations.
