Parallel submanifolds of complex projective space and their normal
  holonomy
The object of this article is to compute the holonomy group of the normal
connection of complex parallel submanifolds of the complex projective space. We
also give a new proof of the classification of complex parallel submanifolds by
using a normal holonomy approach. Indeed, we explain how these submanifolds can
be regarded as the unique complex orbits of the (projectivized) isotropy
representation of an irreducible Hermitian symmetric space. Moreover, we show
how these important submanifolds are related to other areas of mathematics and
theoretical physics. Finally, we state a conjecture about the normal holonomy
group of a complete and full complex submanifold of the complex projective
space.
