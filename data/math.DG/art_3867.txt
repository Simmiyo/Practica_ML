1|1 Parallel Transport and Connections
A vector bundle with connection over a supermanifold leads naturally to a
notion of parallel transport along superpaths. In this note we show that {\it
every} such parallel transport along superpaths comes form a vector bundle with
connection, at least when the base supermanifold is a manifold.
