On Locally Conformally Flat Gradient Steady Ricci Solitons
In this paper, we classify n-dimensional (n>2) complete noncompact locally
conformally flat gradient steady solitons. In particular, we prove that a
complete noncompact non-flat conformally flat gradient steady Ricci soliton is,
up to scaling, the Bryant soliton.
