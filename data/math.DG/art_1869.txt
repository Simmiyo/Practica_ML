Weighted Poincaré inequality and rigidity of complete manifolds
We prove structure theorems for complete manifolds satisfying both the Ricci
curvature lower bound and the weighted Poincar\'e inequality. In the process, a
sharp decay estimate for the minimal positive Green's function is obtained.
This estimate only depends on the weight function of the Poincar\'e inequality,
and yields a criterion of parabolicity of connected components at infinity in
terms of the weight function.
