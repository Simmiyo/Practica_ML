Local rigidity in quaternionic hyperbolic space
In this note, we study deformations of quaternionic hyperbolic lattices in
larger quaternionic hyperbolic spaces and prove local rigidity results. On the
other hand, surface groups are shown to be more flexible in quaternionic
hyperbolic plane than in complex hyperbolic plane.
