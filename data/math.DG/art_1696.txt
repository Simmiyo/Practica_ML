On the l-Function and the Reduced Volume of Perelman I
The main purpose of this paper is to present a number of analytic and
geometric properties of the $l$-function and the reduced volume of Perelman,
including in particular the monotonicity, the upper bound and the rigidities of
the reduced volume.
