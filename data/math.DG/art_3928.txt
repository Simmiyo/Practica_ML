Natural Connections on Riemannian Product Manifolds
A Riemannian almost product manifold with integrable almost product structure
is called a Riemannian product manifold. In the present paper the natural
connections on such manifolds are studied, i.e. the linear connections
preserving the almost product structure and the Riemannian metric.
