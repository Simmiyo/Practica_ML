The Hermitian Laplace Operator on Nearly Kähler Manifolds
The moduli space NK of infinitesimal deformations of a nearly K\"ahler
structure on a compact 6-dimensional manifold is described by a certain
eigenspace of the Laplace operator acting on co-closed primitive (1,1) forms.
Using the Hermitian Laplace operator and some representation theory, we compute
the space NK on all 6-dimensional homogeneous nearly K\"ahler manifolds. It
turns out that the nearly K\"ahler structure is rigid except for the flag
manifold F(1,2)=SU_3/T^2, which carries an 8-dimensional moduli space of
infinitesimal nearly K\"ahler deformations, modeled on the Lie algebra su_3 of
the isometry group.
