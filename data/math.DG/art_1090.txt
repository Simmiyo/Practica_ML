Timelike Minimal Surfaces via Loop Groups
We study manifolds with split-complex structure and apply some general
results to the study of Lorentz surfaces. In particular, we apply our results
to timelike minimal immersions. The conformal realization of these surfaces is
obtained using a representation based on loop groups. The classical Weierstrass
representation (integral formula) is recovered as a byproduct of this general
setting.
