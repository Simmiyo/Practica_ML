Translating graphs by Mean curvature flow in $\M^n\times\Real$
In this work, we study graphs in $\M^n\times\Real$ that are evolving by the
mean curvature flow over a bounded domain on $\M^n$, with prescribed contact
angle in the boundary. We prove that solutions converge to translating surfaces
in $\M^n\times\Real$. Also, for a Riemannian manifold $\M^2$ with negative
Gaussian curvature at each point, we show non-existence of complete vertically
translating graphs in $\M^2\times\Real$.
