Lie Groups of Fourier Integral Operators on Open Manifolds
We endow the group of invertible Fourier integral operators on an
open}manifold with the structure of an ILH Lie group. This is done by
establishing such structures for the groups of invertible pseudodifferential
operators and contact transformations on an open manifold of bounded geometry,
and gluing those together via a local section.
