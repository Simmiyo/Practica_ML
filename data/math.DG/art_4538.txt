Stable 3-spheres in $\mathbb{C}^3$
By only using spectral theory of the Laplace operator on spheres, we prove
that the unit 3-dimensional sphere of a 2-dimensional complex subspace of
$\mathbb{C}^3$ is a $\Omega$-stable submanifold with parallel mean curvature,
when $\Omega$ is the K\"ahler calibration of rank 4 of $\mathbb{C}^3$.
