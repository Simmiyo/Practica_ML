T-structure and the Yamabe invariant
The Yamabe invariant is an invariant of a closed smooth manifold, which
contains information about possible scalar curvature on it. It is well-known
that a product manifold T^m\times B where T^m$ is the m-dimensional torus, and
B is a closed spin manifold of nonzero \hat{A}-genus has zero Yamabe invariant.
We generalize it to various T-structured manifolds, for example T^m-bundles
over such B whose transition functions take values in Sp(m,Z) (or
Sp(m-1,Z)\oplus \pm 1 for odd m).
