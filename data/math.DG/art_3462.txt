On the axiom of planes and the axiom of spheres in the almost Hermitian
  geometry
Criterions for constancy of the holomorphic sectional curvature and the
antiholomorphic sectional curvature are proved for almost Hermitian manifolds.
It is shown, that an almost Hermitian manifold satisfying the axiom of
antiholomorphic planes or the axiom of antiholomorphic spheres is a real or a
complex space form.
