A spinor approach to Walker geometry
A four-dimensional Walker geometry is a four-dimensional manifold M with a
neutral metric g and a parallel distribution of totally null two-planes. This
distribution has a natural characterization as a projective spinor field
subject to a certain constraint. Spinors therefore provide a natural tool for
studying Walker geometry, which we exploit to draw together several themes in
recent explicit studies of Walker geometry and in other work of Dunajski (2002)
and Plebanski (1975) in which Walker geometry is implicit. In addition to
studying local Walker geometry, we address a global question raised by the use
of spinors.
