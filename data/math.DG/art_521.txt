The definition of a differential form on a tangent structure
Three definitions of a differential form on a tangent structure are
considere. It is proved that the (covariant) definition given by Souriau (as a
collection of forms indexed by the plaques) is equivalent to a smooth section
of the corresponding vector bundle if the space does not have transverse
points.
