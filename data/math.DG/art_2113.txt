Cross Curvature Flow on Locally Homogenous Three-manifolds (I)
Chow and Hamilton introduced the cross curvature flow on closed 3-manifolds
with negative or positive sectional curvature. In this paper, we study the
negative cross curvature flow in the case of locally homogenous metrics on
3-manifolds. In each case, we describe the long time behavior of the solutions
of the corresponding ODE system.
