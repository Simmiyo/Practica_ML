A variational proof for the existence of a conformal metric with
  preassigned negative Gaussian curvature for compact Riemann surfaces of genus
  $>1$
Given an smooth function $K <0$ we prove a result by Berger, Kazhdan and
others that in every conformal class there exists a metric which attains this
function as its Gaussian curvature for a compact Riemann surface of genus
$g>1$. We do so by minimizing an appropriate functional using elementary
analysis. In particular for $K$ a negative constant, this provides an
elementary proof of the uniformization theorem for compact Riemann surfaces of
genus $g >1$.
