On paraquaternionic submersions between paraquaternionic Kähler
  manifolds
In this paper we deal with some properties of a class of semi-Riemannian
submersions between manifolds endowed with paraquaternionic structures, proving
a result of non-existence of paraquaternionic submersions between
paraquaternionic K\"ahler non locally hyper paraK\"ahler manifolds. Then we
examine, as an example, the canonical projection of the tangent bundle, endowed
with the Sasaki metric, of an almost paraquaternionic Hermitian manifold.
