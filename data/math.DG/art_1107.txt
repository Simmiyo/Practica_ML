Geometry of Kaehler metrics and holomorphic foliation by discs
The purpose of this paper is to establish a partial regularity theory on
certain homogeneous complex Monge-Ampere equations. As consequences of this new
theory, we prove the uniqueness of extremal Kaehler metrics and give an
necessary condition for existence of extremal Kaehler metrics.
