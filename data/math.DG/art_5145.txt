The classifications of certain kind of isoparametric submanifolds in
  non-compact symmetric spaces
In this paper, we prove that full irreducible curvature-adapted isoparametric
submanifolds of codimension greater than one in a symmetric space of
non-compact type are principal orbits of Hermann actions on the symmetric
spaces under certain conditions.
