Some elementary consequences of Perelman's canonical neighborhood
  theorem
In this purely expository note, we recall a few known properties of
3-dimensional singularity models. These properties are direct consequences of
Perelman's canonical neighborhood theorem for 3-dimensional Ricci flow and
compactness theorem for 3-dimensional kappa-solutions.
