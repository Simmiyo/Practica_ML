Gauss maps of constant mean curvature surfaces in three-dimensional
  homogeneous spaces
It is well-known that for a surface in a 3-dimensional real space form the
constancy of the mean curvature is equivalent to the harmonicity of the Gauss
map. However, this is not true in general for surfaces in an arbitrary
3-dimensional ambient space. In this paper we study this problem for surfaces
in an important and very natural family of 3-dimensional ambient spaces, namely
homogeneous spaces. In particular, we obtain a full classification of constant
mean curvature surfaces, whose Gauss map satisfies the more mild condition of
vertical harmonicity, in all 3-dimensional homogeneous spaces.
