Generalized G_2-manifolds and SU(3)-structures
We construct a compact example of 7- dimensional manifold endowed with a
weakly integrable generalized G_2-structure with respect to a closed and non
trivial 3-form. Moreover, we investigate which type of SU(3)-structures on a
6-dimensional manifold N give rise to a strongly integrable generalized
G_2-structure with respect to a non trivial 3-form on the product $N \times
S^1$.
