Self-similar solutions to the mean curvature flow in the Minkowski plane
  $\mathbf R^{1,1}$
We introduce the mean curvature flow of curves in the Minkowski plane
$\mathbf R^{1,1}$ and give a classification of all the self-similar solutions.
In addition, we describe five other exact solutions to the flow.
