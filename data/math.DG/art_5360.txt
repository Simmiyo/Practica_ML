The consistency and convergence of K-energy minimizing movements
We show that K-energy minimizing movements agree with smooth solutions to
Calabi flow as long as the latter exist. As corollaries we conclude that in a
general Kahler class long time solutions of Calabi flow minimize both K-energy
and Calabi energy. Lastly, by applying convergence results from the theory of
minimizing movements, these results imply that long time solutions to Calabi
flow converge in the weak distance topology to minimizers of the K-energy
functional on the metric completion of the space of Kahler metrics, assuming
one exists.
