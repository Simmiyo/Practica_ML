On Strong r-Helix Submanifolds and Special Curves
In this paper, we investigate special curves on a strong r-helix submanifold
in Euclidean n-space E n. Also, we give the important relations between strong
r-helix submanifolds and the special curves such as line of curvature, geodesic
and slant helix.
