Index theory with bounded geometry, the uniformly finite A-hat class,
  and infinite connected sums
We analyze the obstruction to metrics of positive scalar curvature within a
given bounded distortion class of metrics. This obstruction lives in a
non-Hausdorff cohomology group Poincare dual to the uniformly finite homology
studied by Block and Weinberger. One of the applications is a converse to their
theorem on infinite connected sums, giving a complete picture of when such
manifolds have metrics of positive scalar curvature.
