On complex Landsberg and Berwald spaces
In this paper, we study the complex Landsberg spaces and some of their
important subclasses. We introduce and characterize the class of generalized
Berwald and complex Landsberg spaces. The intersection of these spaces gives
the so called $G-$ Landsberg class.
