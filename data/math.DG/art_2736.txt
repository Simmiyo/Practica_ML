Irreducible complex skew-Berger algebras
Irreducible skew-Berger algebras $\g\subset\gl(n,\Co)$, i.e. algebras spanned
by the images of the linear maps $R:\odot^2\Co^n\to\g$ satisfying the Bianchi
identity, are classified. These Lie algebras can be interpreted as irreducible
complex Berger superalgebras contained in $\gl(0|n,\Co)$.
