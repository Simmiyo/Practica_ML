Hermann type actions on a pseudo-Riemannian symmetric space
We first investigate the geometry of orbits of the isotropy action on a
semi-simple pseudo-Riemannian symmetric space by investigating the complexified
action. Next we investigate the geometry of the orbits of Hermann type actions
on the symmetric spaces. By considering two special Hermann type actions on the
symmetric space, we recognize an interesting structure of the symmetric space.
