Asymptotic geometry and growth of conjugacy classes of nonpositively
  curved manifolds
Let X be a Hadamard manifold and $\Gamma$ a discrete group of isometries of X
which contains an axial isometry without invariant flat half plane. We study
the behavior of conformal densities on the geometric limit set of $\Gamma$ in
order to derive a new asymptotic estimate for the growth rate of closed
geodesics in not necessarily compact or finite volume manifolds.
