Heat kernels, symplectic geometry, moduli spaces and finite groups
In this note we apply heat kernels to derive some localization formula in
sympletcic geometry, to study moduli spaces of flat connections on a Riemann
surface, to obtain the push-forward measures for certain maps between Lie
groups and to solve equations in finite groups.
