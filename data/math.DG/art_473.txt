Surfaces in 3-space possessing nontrivial deformations which preserve
  the shape operator
The class of surfaces in 3-space possessing nontrivial deformations which
preserve principal directions and principal curvatures (or, equivalently, the
shape operator) was investigated by Finikov and Gambier as far back as in 1933.
We review some of the known examples and results, demonstrate the integrability
of the corresponding Gauss-Codazzi equations and draw parallels between this
geometrical problem and the theory of compatible Poisson brackets of
hydrodynamic type. It turns out that coordinate hypersurfaces of the
n-orthogonal systems arising in the theory of compatible Poisson brackets of
hydrodynamic type must necessarily possess deformations preserving the shape
operator.
