Applying inversion to construct rational spiral curves
A method is proposed to construct spiral curves by inversion of a spiral arc
of parabola. The resulting curve is rational of 4-th order. Proper selection of
the parabolic arc and parameters of inversion allows to match a wide range of
boundary conditions, namely, tangents and curvatures at the endpoints,
including those, assuming inflection.
