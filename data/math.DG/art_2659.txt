On the curvature of biquotients
As a means to better understanding manifolds with positive curvature, there
has been much recent interest in the study of non-negatively curved manifolds
which contain either a point or an open dense set of points at which all
2-planes have positive curvature. We study infinite families of biquotients
defined by Eschenburg and Bazaikin from this viewpoint, together with torus
quotients of $S^3 \x S^3$.
