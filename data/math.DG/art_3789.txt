The space of solsolitons in low dimensions
Up to now, the only known examples of homogeneous nontrivial Ricci soliton
metrics are the so called solsolitons, i.e. certain left invariant metrics on
simple connected solvable Lie groups. In this paper, we describe the moduli
space of solsolitons of dimension less or equal than 6, up to isomorphism and
scaling. We start with the already known classification of nilsolitons and,
following the characterization given by Lauret, we describe the subspace of
solsolitons associated to a given nilsoliton, as the quotient of a Grassmanian
by a finite group.
