Genus-One Helicoids from a Variational Point of View
We prove by variational means the existence of a complete, properly embedded,
genus-one minimal surface in R^3 that is asymptotic to a helicoid at infinity.
We also prove existence of surfaces that are asymptotic to a helicoid away from
the helicoid's axis, but that have infinitely many handles arranged
periodically along the axis. Finally, we prove some new properties of such
helicoid-like surfaces.
