Homogeneous Ricci solitons
In this work, we study metrics which are both homogeneous and Ricci soliton.
If there exists a transitive solvable group of isometries on a Ricci soliton,
we show that it is isometric to a solvsoliton. Moreover, unless the manifold is
flat, it is necessarily simply-connected and diffeomorphic to $\mathbb R^n$.
  In the general case, we prove that homogeneous Ricci solitons must be
semi-algebraic Ricci solitons in the sense that they evolve under the Ricci
flow by dilation and pullback by automorphisms of the isometry group. In the
special case that there exists a transitive semi-simple group of isometries on
a Ricci soliton, we show that such a space is in fact Einstein. In the compact
case, we produce new proof that Ricci solitons are necessarily Einstein.
  Lastly, we characterize solvable Lie groups which admit Ricci soliton
metrics.
