Density estimates for compact surfaces with total boundary curvature
  less than 4pi
In this paper we obtain density estimates for compact surfaces immersed in
R^n with total boundary curvature less than 4pi and with sufficiently small L^p
norm of the mean curvature, p>2. Our results generalize the main results in
[2]. We then apply our estimates to discuss the geometry and topology of such
surfaces.
