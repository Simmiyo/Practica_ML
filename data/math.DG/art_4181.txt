Spheres of small diameter with long sweep-outs
We prove the absence of a universal diameter bound on lengths of curves in a
sweep-out of a Riemannian 2-sphere. If such bound existed it would yield a
simple proof of existence of short geodesic segments and closed geodesics on a
sphere of small diameter.
