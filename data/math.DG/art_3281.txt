On $(\varepsilon)$-para Sasakian 3-manifolds
In this paper we study the 3-dimensional $(\varepsilon) $-para Sasakian
manifolds. We obtain an necessary and sufficient condition for an $(\varepsilon
) $-para Sasakian 3 -manifold to be an indefinite space form. We show that a
Ricci-semi-symmetric $(\varepsilon) $-para Sasakian 3 -manifold is an
indefinite space form. We investigate the necessary and sufficient condition
for an $(\varepsilon) $-para Sasakian 3 -manifold to be locally $\varphi
$-symmetric. It is proved that in an $ (\varepsilon) $-para Sasakian 3-manifold
with $\eta $ -parallel Ricci tensor the scalar curvature is constant. It is
also shown that every $(\varepsilon) $-para Sasakian 3-manifolds is
pseudosymmetric in the sense of R. Deszcz.
