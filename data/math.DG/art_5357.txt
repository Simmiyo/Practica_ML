Higher order mean curvature estimates for bounded complete hypersurfaces
We obtain sharp estimates involving the mean curvatures of higher order of a
complete bounded hypersurface immersed in a complete Riemannian manifold.
Similar results are also given for complete spacelike hypersurfaces in
Lorentzian ambient spaces.
