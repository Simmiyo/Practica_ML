A criterion on instability of rotating cylindrical surfaces
We consider a column of a rotating stationary surface in Euclidean space. We
obtain a value $l_0>0$ in such way that if the length $l$ of column satisfies
$l>l_0$, then the surface is instable. This extends, in some sense, previous
results due to Plateau and Rayleigh for columns of surfaces with constant mean
curvature.
