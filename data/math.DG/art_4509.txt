Special curves of 4d galilean space
Special curves and their characterizations are one of the main area of
mathematicians and physicians.
  As a special curve we will mainly focus on Mannheim curve which has the
following relation: k1={\beta}(k1^2+k2^) where k1 and k2 are curvature and
torsion, respectively.
  In the present paper we define Mannheim curves for 4-dimensional Galilean
space and investigate some characterization of it.
