Foliations with complex leaves and instability for harmonic foliations
In this paper, we study stability for harmonic foliations on locally
conformal K\"ahler manifolds with complex leaves. We also discuss instability
for harmonic foliations on compact submanifolds immersed in Euclidean spaces
and compact homogeneous spaces.
