A prime geodesic theorem for SL(4)
A prime geodesic theorem is proven for singular geodesics in quotients of
SL(4). This is a case where regularity assumptions of previous papers fail. As
a consequence, the analysis becomes much more involved. For applications in
number theory (class number asymptotics) it is, however, necessary to consider
this case, too.
