Linear estimate for the number of zeros of Abelian integrals
We prove a linear in $\deg\omega$ upper bound on the number of real zeros of
the Abelian integral $I(t)=\int_{\delta(t)}\omega$, where
$\delta(t)\subset\R^2$ is the real oval $x^2y(1-x-y)=t$ and $\omega$ is a
one-form with polynomial coefficients.
