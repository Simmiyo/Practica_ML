Collapsing and the Differential Form Laplacian : The Case of a Singular
  Limit Space
In this paper, which is a sequel to math.DG/9902111, we analyze the limit of
the p-form Laplacian under a collapse with bounded sectional curvature and
bounded diameter to a singular limit space. As applications, we give results
about upper and lower bounds on the j-th eigenvalue of the p-form Laplacian, in
terms of sectional curvature and diameter.
