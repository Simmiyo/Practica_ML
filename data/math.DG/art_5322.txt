Asymptotically cylindrical Calabi-Yau manifolds
Let $M$ be a complete Ricci-flat Kahler manifold with one end and assume that
this end converges at an exponential rate to $[0,\infty) \times X$ for some
compact connected Ricci-flat manifold $X$. We begin by proving general
structure theorems for $M$; in particular we show that there is no loss of
generality in assuming that $M$ is simply-connected and irreducible with
Hol$(M)$ $=$ SU$(n)$, where $n$ is the complex dimension of $M$. If $n > 2$ we
then show that there exists a projective orbifold $\bar{M}$ and a divisor
$\bar{D}$ in $|{-K_{\bar{M}}}|$ with torsion normal bundle such that $M$ is
biholomorphic to $\bar{M}\setminus\bar{D}$, thereby settling a long-standing
question of Yau in the asymptotically cylindrical setting. We give examples
where $\bar{M}$ is not smooth: the existence of such examples appears not to
have been noticed previously. Conversely, for any such pair $(\bar{M},
\bar{D})$ we give a short and self-contained proof of the existence and
uniqueness of exponentially asymptotically cylindrical Calabi-Yau metrics on
$\bar{M}\setminus\bar{D}$.
