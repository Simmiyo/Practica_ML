On the Cohomology of the spaces of differential operators acting on
  skewsymmetric tensor fields or on forms, as modules of the Lie algebra of
  vector fields
The space of differential operators acting on skewsymmetric tensor fields or
on smooth forms of a smooth manifold are representations of its Lie algebra of
vector fields. We compute the first cohomology spaces of these representations
and show how they are related to the cohomology with coefficients in ther space
of smooth functions of the manifold.
