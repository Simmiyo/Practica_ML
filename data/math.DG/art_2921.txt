Embedded hypersurfaces with constant $m^{\text{th}}$ mean curvature in a
  unit sphere
In this paper, we study $n$-dimensional hypersurfaces with constant
$m^{\text{th}}$ mean curvature in a unit sphere $S^{n+1}(1)$ and construct many
compact nontrivial embedded hypersurfaces with constant $m^{\text{th}}$ mean
curvature $H_m>0$ in $S^{n+1}(1)$, for $1\leq m\leq n-1$. In particular, if the
$4^{\text{th}}$ mean curvature $H_4$ takes value between $\dfrac{1}{(\tan
\frac{\pi}{k})^4}$ and $\dfrac{k^4-4}{n(n-4)}$ for any integer $k\geq3$, then
there exists an $n$-dimensional ($n\geq 5$) compact nontrivial embedded
hypersurface with constant $H_4$ in $S^{n+1}(1)$.
