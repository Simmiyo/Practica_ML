Gluing Seiberg-Witten monopoles
We establish a canonical gluing procedure for Seiberg-Witten monopoles on the
two pieces of a closed, oriented 4-manifold X which is split along a
3-dimensional closed, oriented submanifold. We only assume that the
(unperturbed) character variety is Kuranishi-smooth and the limiting maps are
transversal -- then we will be able to glue regular monopoles over the
irreducible points of the character variety.
