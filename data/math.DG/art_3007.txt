The Maximum Principle for Minimal Varieties of Arbitrary Codimension
We prove that an m-dimensional minimal variety in a Riemannian manifold
cannot touch the boundary at a point where the sum of the smallest m principal
curvatures is greater than 0. We also prove an analogous result for varieties
with bounded mean curvature.
