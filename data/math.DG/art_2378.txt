Lightlike hypersurfaces in indefinite $\mathcal{S}$-manifolds
In a metric $g.f.f$-manifold we study lightlike hypersurfaces $M$ tangent to
the characteristic vector fields, and owing to the presence of the
$f$-structure, we determine some decompositions of $TM$ and of a chosen screen
distribution obtaining two distributions invariant with respect to the
structure. We discuss the existence of a $g.f.f$-structure on a lightlike
hypersurface and, under suitable hypotheses, we obtain an indefinite
$\mathcal{S}$-structure on the leaves of an integrable distribution. The
existence of totally umbilical lightlike hypersurfaces of an indefinite
$\mathcal{S}$-space form is also discussed. Finally, we explicitely describe a
lightlike hypersurface of an indefinite $\mathcal{S}$-manifold.
