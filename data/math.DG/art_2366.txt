Orbits of s-representations with degenerate Gauss mappings
In this paper we study tangentially degeneracy of the orbits of
s-representations in the sphere. We show that an orbit of an s-representation
is tangentially degenerate if and only if it is through a long root, or a short
root of restricted root system of type G_2. Moreover these orbits provide many
new examples of tangentially degenerate submanifolds which satisfy the Ferus
equality.
