Lifts of Poisson structures to Weil bundles
In the present paper, we study complete and vertical lifts of tensor fields
from a smooth manifold $M$ to its Weil bundle $T^A M$ defined by a Frobenius
Weil algebra $A$. For a Poisson manifold $(M,w)$, we show that the complete
lift $w^C$ and the vertical lift $w^V$ of the Poisson tensor $w$ are Poisson
tensors on $T^A M$ and establish their properties. We prove that the complete
and the vertical lifts induce homomorphisms of the Poisson cohomology spaces.
We compute the modular classes of the lifts of Poisson structures.
