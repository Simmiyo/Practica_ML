Sur Les Actions Symplectiques Quasi-Primitives
A transitive smooth action of a connected Lie group G on a manifold M is
called almost primitive (resp. primitive) if G doesn't contain any proper
subgroup (resp. any proper normal subgroup) whose induced action on M is
transitive as well. The aim of the present work is to investigate some
combinatory properties of symplectic actions of completely solvable Lie groups.
