On Nurowski's conformal structure associated to a generic rank two
  distribution in dimension five
For a generic distribution of rank two on a manifold $M$ of dimension five,
we introduce the notion of a generalized contact form. To such a form we
associate a generalized Reeb field and a partial connection. From these data,
we explicitly constructed a pseudo--Riemannian metric on $M$ of split
signature. We prove that a change of the generalized contact form only leads to
a conformal rescaling of this metric, so the corresponding conformal class is
intrinsic to the distribution. In the second part of the article, we relate
this conformal class to the canonical Cartan connection associated to the
distribution. This is used to prove that it coincides with the conformal class
constructed by Nurowski.
