Embedded, Doubly Periodic Minimal Surfaces
We consider the question of existence of embedded doubly periodic minimal
surfaces in Euclidean 3-space with Scherk-type ends, surfaces that
topologically are Scherk's doubly periodic surface with handles added in
various ways. We extend the existence results of H. Karcher and F. Wei to more
cases, and we find other cases where existence does not hold.
