Uniform convergence of discrete curvatures from nets of curvature lines
We study discrete curvatures computed from nets of curvature lines on a given
smooth surface, and prove their uniform convergence to smooth principal
curvatures. We provide explicit error bounds, with constants depending only on
properties of the smooth limit surface and the shape regularity of the discrete
net.
