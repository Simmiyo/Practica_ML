TQFT's and gerbes
We generalize the notion of parallel transport along paths for abelian
bundles to parallel transport along surfaces for abelian gerbes using an
embedded Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT) approach. We show both for
bundles and gerbes with connection that there is a one-to-one correspondence
between their local description in terms of locally-defined functions and forms
and their non-local description in terms of a suitable class of embedded
TQFT's.
