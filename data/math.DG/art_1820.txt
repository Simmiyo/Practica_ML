A metric approach to Fréchet geometry
The aim of this article is to present the category of bounded Frechet
manifolds in respect to which we will review the geometry of Frechet manifolds
with a stronger accent on its metric aspect. An inverse function theorem in the
sense of Nash and Moser in this category is proved, and some applications to
Riemannian geometry are given.
