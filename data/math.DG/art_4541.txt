Potential symmetries and conservation laws for generalized quasilinear
  hyperbolic equations
Based on Lie group method, potential symmetry and invariant solutions for
generalized quasilinear hyperbolic equations are studied. To obtain the
invariant solutions in explicit form, we focus on the physically interesting
situations which admit potential symmetries. Then by using the partial
Lagrangian approach, we find conservation laws for this equation in three
physically interesting cases.
