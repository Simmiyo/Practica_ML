A mean curvature estimate for cylindrically bounded submanifolds
We extend the estimate obtained in [1] for the mean curvature of a
cylindrically bounded proper submanifold in a product manifold with an
Euclidean space as one factor to a general product ambient space endowed with a
warped product structure.
