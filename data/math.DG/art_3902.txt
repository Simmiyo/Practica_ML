Duality of symmetric spaces and polar actions
We study isometric actions on Riemannian symmetric spaces of noncompact type
which are induced by reductive algebraic subgroups of the isometry group. We
show that for such an action there exists a corresponding isometric action on a
dual compact symmetric space, which reflects many properties of the original
action. For example, the principal isotropy subgroups of both actions are
locally isomorphic and the dual action is (hyper)polar if and only if the
original action is (hyper)polar. This fact provides many new examples for polar
actions on symmetric spaces of noncompact type and we use duality as a method
to study polar actions by reductive algebraic subgroups in the isometry group
of an irreducible symmetric space. Among other applications, we show that they
are hyperpolar if the space is of type III and of higher rank; we prove that
such actions are orbit equivalent to Hermann actions if they are hyperpolar and
of cohomogeneity greater than one. Furthermore, we classify polar actions by
reductive algebraic subgroups of the isometry group on noncompact symmetric
spaces of rank one.
