On Einstein Matsumoto metrics
In this paper, the necessary and sufficient conditions for Matsumoto metrics
$F=\frac{\alpha^2}{\alpha-\beta}$ to be Einstein are given. It is shown that if
the length of $\beta$ with respect to $\alpha$ is constant, then the Matsumoto
metric $F$ is an Einstein metric if and only if $\alpha$ is Ricci-flat and
$\beta$ is parallel with respect to $\alpha$. A nontrivial example of Ricci
flat Matsumoto metrics is given.
