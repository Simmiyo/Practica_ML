Covariant almost analytic vector field on Q - Quasi umbilical
  hypersurface of a Sasakian manifold
In this paper we have studied the properties of covariant almost analytic
vector field on Q - quasi umbilical hypersurface $M$ of a Sasakian manifold
$\tilde M$ with $(\phi, g, u, v, \lambda)-$structure and obtained the scalars
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ using $1 - form u, v$ covariant almost analytic for the
hypersurface $M$ to be totally umbilical and cylindrical.
