Discrete holomorphic geometry I. Darboux transformations and spectral
  curves
Finding appropriate notions of discrete holomorphic maps and, more generally,
conformal immersions of discrete Riemann surfaces into 3-space is an important
problem of discrete differential geometry and computer visualization. We
propose an approach to discrete conformality that is based on the concept of
holomorphic line bundles over "discrete surfaces", by which we mean the vertex
sets of triangulated surfaces with bi-colored set of faces. The resulting
theory of discrete conformality is simultaneously Moebius invariant and based
on linear equations. In the special case of maps into the 2-sphere we obtain a
reinterpretation of the theory of complex holomorphic functions on discrete
surfaces introduced by Dynnikov and Novikov. As an application of our theory we
introduce a Darboux transformation for discrete surfaces in the conformal
4-sphere. This Darboux transformation can be interpreted as the space- and
time-discrete Davey-Stewartson flow of Konopelchenko and Schief.
