Discrete spectrum and Weyl's asymptotic formula for incomplete manifolds
Motivated by recent interest in the spectrum of the Laplacian of incomplete
surfaces with isolated conical singularities, we consider more general
incomplete m-dimensional manifolds with singularities on sets of codimension at
least 2. With certain restrictions on the metric, we establish that the
spectrum is discrete and satisfies Weyl's asymptotic formula.
