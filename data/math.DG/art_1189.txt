Differential Geometry, Lie Groups and Symmetric Spaces over General Base
  Fields and Rings
The aim of this work is to lay the foundations of differential geometry and
Lie theory over the general class of topological base fields and -rings for
which a differential calculus has been developed in recent work (collaboration
with H. Gloeckner and K.-H. Neeb), without any restriction on the dimension or
on the characteristic. Two basic features distinguish our approach from the
classical real (finite or infinite dimensional) theory, namely the
interpretation of tangent- and jet functors as functors of scalar extensions
and the introduction of multilinear bundles and multilinear connections which
generalize the concept of vector bundles and linear connections.
