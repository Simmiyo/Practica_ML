Eigenvalues of the basic Dirac operator on quaternion-Kahler foliations
In this paper, we give an optimal lower bound for the eigenvalues of the
basic Dirac operator on a quaternion-Kahler foliation. The limiting case is
characterized by the existence of quaternion-Kahler Killing spinors. We end
this paper by giving some examples.
