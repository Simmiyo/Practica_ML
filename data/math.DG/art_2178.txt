Bochner-Kaehler metrics and connections of Ricci type
We apply the results from the article Cahen, Schwachh\"ofer: Special
symplectic connections, to the case of Bochner-Kaehler metrics. We obtain a
(local) classification of these based on the orbit types of the adjoint action
in $su(n,1)$. The relation between Sasaki and Bochner-Kaehler metrics in cone
and transveral metrics constructions is discussed. The connection of the
special symplectic and Weyl connections is outlined. The duality between the
Ricci-type and Bochner-Kaehler metrics is shown.
