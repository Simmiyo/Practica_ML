Dressing preserving the fundamental group
In this note we consider the relationship between the dressing action and the
holonomy representation in the context of constant mean curvature surfaces. We
characterize dressing elements that preserve the topology of a surface and
discuss dressing by simple factors as a means of adding bubbles to a class of
non finite type cylinders.
