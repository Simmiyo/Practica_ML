Descending maps between slashed tangent bundles
Suppose $TM\setminus \{0\}$ and $T\widetilde M\setminus\{0\}$ are slashed
tangent bundles of two smooth manifolds $M$ and $\widetilde M$, respectively.
In this paper we characterize those diffeomorphisms $F\colon TM\setminus\{0\}
\to T\widetilde M\setminus\{0\}$ that can be written as $F =
(D\phi)|_{TM\setminus\{0\}}$ for a diffeomorphism $\phi\colon M\to \wt M$. When
$F = (D\phi)|_{TM\setminus\{0\}}$ one say that $F$ \emph{descends}. If $M$ is
equipped with two sprays, we use the characterization to derive sufficient
conditions that imply that $F$ descends to a totally geodesic map. Specializing
to Riemann geometry we also obtain sufficient conditions for $F$ to descent to
an isometry.
