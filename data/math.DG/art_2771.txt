A formalism for the study of Natural Tensors Fields of type (0,2) on
  Manifolds and Fibrations
In order to study tensor fields of type (0,2) on manifolds and fibrations we
introduce the notion of s-spaces. With the help of these objects we generalized
the concept of natural tensor without making use of the theory of natural
operators and differential invariants.
