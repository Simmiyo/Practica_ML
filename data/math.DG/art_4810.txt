Similar Ruled Surfaces with Variable Transformations in the Euclidean
  3-space
In this study, we define a family of ruled surfaces in the Euclidean 3-space
E^3 and called similar ruled surfaces. We obtain some properties of these
special surfaces and we show that developable ruled surfaces form a family of
similar ruled surfaces if and only if the striction curves of the surfaces are
similar curves with variable transformation.
