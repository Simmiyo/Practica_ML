A Uniformization Theorem Of Complete Noncompact Kähler Surfaces With
  Positive Bisectional Curvature
In this paper, by combining techniques from Ricci flow and algebraic
geometry, we prove the following generalization of the classical uniformization
theorem of Riemann surfaces. Given a complete noncompact complex two
dimensional K\"ahler manifold $M$ of positive and bounded holomorphic
bisectional curvature, suppose its geodesic balls have Euclidean volume growth
and its scalar curvature decays to zero at infinity in the average sense, then
$M$ is biholomorphic to $\C^2$. During the proof, we also discover an
interesting gap phenomenon which says that a K\"ahler manifold as above
automatically has quadratic curvature decay at infinity in the average sense.
