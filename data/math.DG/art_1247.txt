On Vertices and Focal Curvatures of Space Curves
The {\em focal curve} of an immersed smooth curve $\gamma:s\mapsto
\gamma(s)$, in Euclidean space $\R^{m+1}$, consists of the centres of its
osculating hyperspheres. The focal curve may be parametrised in terms of the
Frenet frame of $\gamma$ (${\bf t},{\bf n}_1, ...,{\bf n}_m$), as
$C_\gamma(s)=(\gamma+c_1{\bf n}_1+c_2{\bf n}_2+...+c_m{\bf n}_m)(s)$, where the
coefficients $c_1,...,c_{m-1}$ are smooth functions that we call the {\em focal
curvatures} of $\gamma$. We discovered a remarkable formula relating the
Euclidean curvatures $\kappa_i$, $i=1,...,m$, of $\gamma$ with its focal
curvatures. We show that the focal curvatures satisfy a system of Frenet
equations (not vectorial, but scalar!). We use the properties of the focal
curvatures in order to give, for $k=1,...,m$, necessary and sufficient
conditions for the radius of the osculating $k$-dimensional sphere to be
critical. We also give necessary and sufficient conditions for a point of
$\gamma$ to be a vertex. Finally, we show explicitly the relations of the
Frenet frame and the Euclidean curvatures of $\gamma$ with the Frenet frame and
the Euclidean curvatures of its focal curve $C_\gamma$.
