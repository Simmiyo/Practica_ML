Spectrum of the Laplacian on manifolds with Spin(9) holonomy
We consider noncompact complete manifolds with Spin(9) holonomy and proved an
one end result and a splitting type theorem under different conditions on the
bottom of the spectrum. We proved that any harmonic functions with finite
Dirichlet integral must be Cayley-harmonic, which allowed us to conclude an one
end result. In the second part, we established a splitting type theorem by
utilizing the Busemann function..
