Relating the curvature tensor and the complex Jacobi operator of an
  almost Hermitian manifold
Let J be a unitary almost complex structure on a Riemannian manifold (M,g).
If x is a unit tangent vector, let P be the associated complex line spanned by
x and by Jx. We show that if (M,g) is Hermitian or if (M,g) is nearly Kaehler,
then either the complex Jacobi operator (JC(P)y=R(y,x)x+R(y,Jx)Jx) or the
complex curvature operator (RC(P)y=R(x,Jx)y) completely determine the full
curvature operator; this generalizes a well known result in the real setting to
the complex setting. We also show this result fails for general almost
Hermitian manifold.
