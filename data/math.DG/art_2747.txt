Forgetful maps between Deligne-Mostow ball quotients
We study forgetful maps between Deligne-Mostow moduli spaces of weighted
points on P^1, and classify the forgetful maps that extend to a map of
orbifolds between the stable completions. The cases where this happens include
the Livn\'e fibrations and the Mostow/Toledo maps between complex hyperbolic
surfaces. They also include a retraction of a 3-dimensional ball quotient onto
one of its 1-dimensional totally geodesic complex submanifolds.
