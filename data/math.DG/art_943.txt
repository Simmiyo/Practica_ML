Prolongations of Geometric Overdetermined Systems
We show that a wide class of geometrically defined overdetermined semilinear
partial differential equations may be explicitly prolonged to obtain closed
systems. As a consequence, in the case of linear equations we extract sharp
bounds on the dimension of the solution space.
