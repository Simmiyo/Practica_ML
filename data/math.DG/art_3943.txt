A Filtration for Isoparametric Hypersurfaces in Riemannian Manifolds
This paper introduces the notion of $k$-isoparametric hypersurface in an
$(n+1)$-dimensional Riemannian manifold for $k=0,1,...,n$. Many fundamental and
interesting results (towards the classification of homogeneous hypersurfaces
among other things) are given in complex projective spaces, complex hyperbolic
spaces, and even in locally rank one symmetric spaces.
