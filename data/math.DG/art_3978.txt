Convergence of Kähler-Ricci flow on Fano manifolds, II
In this paper, we give an alternative proof for the convergence of
K\"ahler-Ricci flow on a Fano mnaifold $(M,J)$. This proof differs from that in
[TZ3]. Moreover, we generalize the main theorem of [TZ3] to the case that
$(M,J)$ may not admit any K\"ahler-Einstein metrics.
