Positively Curved Complete Noncompact Kähler Manifolds
In this paper we give a partial affirmative answer to a conjecture of
Greene-Wu and Yau. We prove that a complete noncompact K\"ahler surface with
positive and bounded sectional curvature and with finite analytic Chern number
$c_{1}(M)^{2}$ is biholomorphic to ${\C}^2$.
