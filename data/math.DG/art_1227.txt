Invariant f-structures in the generalized Hermitian geometry
We collect the recent results on invariant f-structures in the generalized
Hermitian geometry. Here the canonical f-structures on homogeneous k-symmetric
spaces play a remarkable role. Specifically, these structures provide a wealth
of invariant examples for the classes of nearly Kaehler f-structures, Hermitian
f-structures and some others. Finally, we consider all invariant f-structures
on the complex flag manifold SU(3)/T_{max} and describe them in the sense of
generalized Hermitian geometry. In particular, it presents first invariant
examples of Killing f-structures.
