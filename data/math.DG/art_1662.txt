A New Ricci Flow Proof of Frankel Conjecture
The aim of this paper is to give a proof the Frankel conjecture by using the
Kahler Ricci flow alone without assuming apriori the existence of Kahler
Einstein metrics. However, there is an essential difference between the real
case and the Kahler case. I didn't realize this difference in the calculation
of the previous version thus made a mistake on the crucial point.
