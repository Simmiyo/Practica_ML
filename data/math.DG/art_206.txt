The Willmore Conjecture for immersed tori with small curvature integral
The Willmore conjecture states that any immersion F:T^2 -> R^n of a 2-torus
into flat euclidean space satisfies $\int_{T^2} H^2\geq 2\pi^2$. We prove it
under the condition that the L^p-norm of the Gaussian curvature is sufficiently
small.
