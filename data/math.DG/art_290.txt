A complete bounded minimal cylinder in R^3
In 1996, Nadirashvili used Runge's theorem to produce a complete minimal disc
inside a ball in R^3. In this paper we generalize the techniques used by
Nadirashvili to obtain new examples of complete minimal surfaces inside a ball
in R^3, with the conformal structure of an annulus.
