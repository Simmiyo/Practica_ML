Reflection of a wave off a surface
Recent advances in twistor theory are applied to geometric optics in
${\Bbb{R}}^3$. The general formulae for reflection of a wavefront in a surface
are derived and in three special cases explicit descriptions are provided: when
the reflecting surface is a plane, when the incoming wave is a plane and when
the incoming wave is spherical. In each case particular examples are computed
exactly and the results plotted to illustrate the outgoing wavefront.
