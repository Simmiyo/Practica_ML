Jet Geometrical Extension of the KCC-Invariants
In this paper we construct the jet geometrical extensions of the
KCC-invariants, which characterize a given second-order system of differential
equations on the 1-jet space $J^1(R,M)$. A generalized theorem of
characterization of our jet geometrical KCC-invariants is also presented.
