Positive scalar curvature and minimal hypersurfaces
We show that the minimal hypersurface method of Schoen and Yau can be used
for the ``quantitative'' study of positive scalar curvature. More precisely, we
show that if a manifold admits a metric $g$ with $s_g \ge | T |$ or $s_g \ge |
W |$, where $s_g$ is the scalar curvature of of $g$, $T$ any 2-tensor on $M$
and $W$ the Weyl tensor of $g$, then any closed orientable stable minimal
(totally geodesic in the second case) hypersurface also admits a metric with
the corresponding positivity of scalar curvature. A corollary about the
topology of such hypersurfaces is proved in a special situation.
