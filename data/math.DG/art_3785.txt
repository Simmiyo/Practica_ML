A short note on 2-step nilpotent Lie algebras associated with graphs
In this note we consider 2-step nilpotent Lie algebras associated with
graphs. We prove that 2-step nilpotent Lie algebras $\n$ and $\n'$ associated
with graphs $(S, E)$ and $(S', E')$ respectively are isomorphic if and only if
$(S, E)$ and $(S', E')$ are isomorphic.
