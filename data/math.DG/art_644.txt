Leafwise holonomy of connections over a bundle map
In this paper we introduce a generalisation of the notion of holonomy for
connections over a bundle map on a principal fibre bundle. We prove that, as in
the standard theory on principal connections, the holonomy groups are Lie
subgroups of the structure group of the principle fibre bundle and we also
derive a straightforward generalisation of the Reduction Theorem.
