On the approximation of functions on a Hodge manifold
If f is a smooth function on a Hodge manifold, we construct a canonical
sequence of real algebraic functions that converge to f in the smooth topology.
The definition of of the approximants is inspired by Berezin-Toeplitz
quantization. The proof follows quickly from known results of Fine, Liu and Ma.
