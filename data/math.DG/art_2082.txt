Cones over pseudo-Riemannian manifolds and their holonomy
By a classical theorem of Gallot (1979), a Riemannian cone over a complete
Riemannian manifold is either flat or has irreducible holonomy. We consider
metric cones with reducible holonomy over pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. First we
describe the local structure of the base of the cone when the holonomy of the
cone is decomposable. For instance, we find that the holonomy algebra of the
base is always the full pseudo-orthogonal Lie algebra. One of the global
results is that a cone over a compact and complete pseudo-Riemannian manifold
is either flat or has indecomposable holonomy. Then we analyse the case when
the cone has indecomposable but reducible holonomy, which means that it admits
a parallel isotropic distribution. This analysis is carried out, first in the
case where the cone admits two complementary distributions and, second for
Lorentzian cones. We show that the first case occurs precisely when the local
geometry of the base manifold is para-Sasakian and that of the cone is
para-K\"ahlerian. For Lorentzian cones we get a complete description of the
possible (local) holonomy algebras in terms of the metric of the base manifold.
