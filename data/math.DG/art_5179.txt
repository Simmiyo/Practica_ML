Almost h-semi-slant Riemannian maps
As a generalization of slant Riemannian maps (Sahin), semi-slant Riemannian
maps (Park), almost h-slant submersions (Park 2012), and almost h-semi-slant
submersions (Park 2011), we introduce the notion of almost h-semi-slant
Riemannian maps from almost quaternionic Hermitian manifolds to Riemannian
manifolds. We investigate the integrability of distributions, the harmonicity
of such maps, the geometry of fibers, etc. We also deal with the condition for
such maps to be totally geodesic and study some decomposition theorems.
Moreover, we give some examples.
