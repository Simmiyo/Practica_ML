On some examples in Symplectic Topology
Article is devoted to the Examples 2 and 3 of the symplectic solvable Lie
groups $R$ with some special cohomological properties, which have been
constructed by Benson and Gordon. But they are not succeeded in constructing
corresponding compact forms for symplectic structures on these Lie groups.
Recently A.Tralle proved that there is no compact form in the Example 3. But
his proof is rather complicated and uses some very special topological methods.
  We propose much more simpler (and purely algebraic) method to prove the main
result of the Tralle's paper. Moreover we prove that for Example 2 there is no
compact form too. But it appears that some modification of the construction of
the Example 2 gives some other example of a solvable Lie group $R^{\prime}$
with the same cohomological properties as $R$, but with a compact form.
