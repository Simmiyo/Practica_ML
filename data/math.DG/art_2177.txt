Generalized Dolbeault sequences in parabolic geometry
In this paper, we show the existence of a sequence of invariant differential
operators on a particular homogeneous model $G/P$ of a Cartan geometry. The
first operator in this sequence can be locally identified with the Dirac
operator in $k$ Clifford variables, $D=(D_1,..., D_k)$, where $D_i=\sum_j
e_j\cdot \partial_{ij}: C^\infty((\R^n)^k,\S)\to C^\infty((\R^n)^k,\S)$. We
describe the structure of these sequences in case the dimension $n$ is odd. It
follows from the construction that all these operators are invariant with
respect to the action of the group $G$.
  These results are obtained by constructing homomorphisms of generalized Verma
modules, what are purely algebraic objects.
