Characterizations of model manifolds by means of certain differential
  systems
We prove metric rigidity for complete manifolds supporting solutions of
certain second order differential systems, thus extending classical works on a
characterization of space-forms. In the route, we also discover new
characterizations of space-forms. We next generalize results concerning metric
rigidity via equations involving vector fields.
