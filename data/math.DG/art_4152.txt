Natural PDE's of Linear Fractional Weingarten surfaces in Euclidean
  Space
We prove that the natural principal parameters on a given Weingarten surface
are also natural principal parameters for the parallel surfaces of the given
one. As a consequence of this result we obtain that the natural PDE of any
Weingarten surface is the natural PDE of its parallel surfaces. We show that
the linear fractional Weingarten surfaces are exactly the surfaces satisfying a
linear relation between their three curvatures. Our main result is
classification of the natural PDE's of Weingarten surfaces with linear relation
between their curvatures.
