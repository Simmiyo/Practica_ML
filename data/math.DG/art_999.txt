Isothermic and S-Willmore Surfaces as Solutions to Blaschke's Problem
We consider the generalization of classical Blaschke's Problem to higher
codimension case, characterizing Darboux pair of isothermic surfaces and dual
S-Willmore surfaces as the only non-trivial surface pairs that envelop a
2-sphere congruence and conformally correspond to each other. When the sphere
congruence is the mean curvature spheres of one envelop surface, it must be a
cmc-1 surface in hyperbolic 3-space, or a S-Willmore surface. A study of
conformally immersed surface pairs is indicated with discussion on the
geometric meaning of new invariants.
