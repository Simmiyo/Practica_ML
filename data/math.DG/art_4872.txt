Stability under deformations of Hermite-Einstein almost-Kähler metrics
On a 4-dimensional compact symplectic manifold, we consider a smooth family
of compatible almost-complex structures such that at time zero the induced
metric is Hermite-Einstein almost-K\"ahler metric with zero or negative
Hermitian scalar curvature. We prove, under certain hypothesis, the existence
of a smooth family of compatible almost-complex structures, diffeomorphic at
each time to the initial family, and inducing constant Hermitian scalar
curvature metrics.
