Intertwinors on Functions over the Product of Spheres
We give explicit formulas for the intertwinors on the scalar functions over
the product of spheres with the natural pseudo-Riemannian product metric using
the spectrum generating technique. As a consequence, this provides another
proof of the even order conformally invariant differential operator formulas
obtained earlier by T. Branson and the present author.
