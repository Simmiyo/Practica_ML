On the long-time behavior of type-III Ricci flow solutions
We show that three-dimensional homogeneous Ricci flow solutions that admit
finite-volume quotients have long-time limits given by expanding solitons. We
show that the same is true for a large class of four-dimensional homogeneous
solutions. We give an extension of Hamilton's compactness theorem that does not
assume a lower injectivity radius bound, in terms of Riemannian groupoids.
Using this, we show that the long-time behavior of type-III Ricci flow
solutions is governed by the dynamics of an R^+ action on a compact space.
