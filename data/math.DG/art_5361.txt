A canonical structure on the tangent bundle of a pseudo- or
  para-Kähler manifold
It is a classical fact that the cotangent bundle $T^* \M$ of a differentiable
manifold $\M$ enjoys a canonical symplectic form $\Omega^*$. If
$(\M,\j,g,\omega)$ is a pseudo-K\"ahler or para-K\"ahler $2n$-dimensional
manifold, we prove that the tangent bundle $T\M$ also enjoys a natural
pseudo-K\"ahler or para-K\"ahler structure $(\J,\G,\Omega)$, where $\Omega$ is
the pull-back by $g$ of $\Omega^*$ and $\G$ is a pseudo-Riemannian metric with
neutral signature $(2n,2n)$. We investigate the curvature properties of the
pair $(\J,\G)$ and prove that: $\G$ is scalar-flat, is not Einstein unless $g$
is flat, has nonpositive (resp.\ nonnegative) Ricci curvature if and only if
$g$ has nonpositive (resp.\ nonnegative) Ricci curvature as well, and is
locally conformally flat if and only if $n=1$ and $g$ has constant curvature,
or $n>2$ and $g$ is flat. We also check that (i) the holomorphic sectional
curvature of $(\J,\G)$ is not constant unless $g$ is flat, and (ii) in $n=1$
case, that $\G$ is never anti-self-dual, unless conformally flat.
