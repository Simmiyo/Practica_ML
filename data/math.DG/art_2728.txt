A note on compact Kähler-Ricci flow with positive bisectional
  curvature
We show that for any solution to the K\"ahler-Ricci flow with positive
bisectional curvature on a compact K\"ahler manifold $M^n$, the bisectional
curvature has a uniform positive lower bound. As a consequence, the solution
converges exponentially fast to an K\"ahler-Einstein metric with positive
bisectional curvature as t tends to the infinity, provided we assume the
Futaki-invariant of $M^n$ is zero. This improves a result of D. Phong, J. Song,
J. Sturm and B. Weinkove in which they assumed the stronger condition that
Mabuchi K-energy is bounded from below.
