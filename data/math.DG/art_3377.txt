Another way of answering Henri Poincare's fundamental question
After G. Perelman's solution of the Poincare Conjecture, this is a different
way toward it. Given a simply connected, closed 3-manifold M, we produce a
homotopy disc H, which arises from M by a finite sequence of simple
modifications and, almost miraculously, can be imbedded into the ordinary space
R^3. It follows that H is a disc, hence M is a sphere. In order to construct H,
we use a special stratification of M, based on the fact that M is simply
connected.
