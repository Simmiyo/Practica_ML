Transformations of compact locally conformally Kähler manifolds
We characterize compact locally conformally K\"ahler (l.c.K.) manifolds under
the assumption of a purely conformal, holomorphic circle action. As an
application, we determine the structure of the compact l.c.K. manifolds with
parallel Lee form. We introduce the Lee-Cauchy-Riemann (LCR) transformations as
a class of diffeomorphisms preserving the specific $G$-structure of l.c.K.
manifolds. Then we characterize the Hopf manifolds, up to holomorphic isometry,
as compact l.c.K. manifolds admitting a certain closed LCR action of
$\mathbb{C}^*$.
