Smooth moduli spaces of associative submanifolds
Let $M^7$ be a smooth manifold equipped with a $G_2$-structure $\phi$, and
$Y^3$ be an closed compact $\phi$-associative submanifold. In \cite{McL}, R.
McLean proved that the moduli space $\bm_{Y,\phi}$ of the $\phi$-associative
deformations of $Y$ has vanishing virtual dimension. In this paper, we perturb
$\phi$ into a $G_2$-structure $\psi$ in order to ensure the smoothness of
$\bm_{Y,\psi}$ near $Y$. If $Y$ is allowed to have a boundary moving in a fixed
coassociative submanifold $X$, it was proved in \cite{GaWi} that the moduli
space $\bm_{Y,X}$ of the associative deformations of $Y$ with boundary in $X$
has finite virtual dimension. We show here that a generic perturbation of the
boundary condition $X$ into $X'$ gives the smoothness of $\bm_{Y,X'}$. In
another direction, we use the Bochner technique to prove a vanishing theorem
that forces $\bm_Y$ or $\bm_{Y,X}$ to be smooth near $Y$. For every case, some
explicit families of examples will be given.
