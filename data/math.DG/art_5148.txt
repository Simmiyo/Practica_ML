The Ricci flow on surfaces with boundary
We show for a non homogeneous boundary value problem for the Ricci flow on
the disk that when the initial metric has positive curvature and the boundary
is convex then the initial metric is deformed, via the normalized flow and
along sequences of times, to a metric of constant curvature and totally
geodesic boundary. We also show that when the geodesic curvature of the
boundary is nonpositive and the metric is rotationally symmetric, the
normalized version of the flow exists for all time.
