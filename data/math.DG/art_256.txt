Variational aspects of the geodesic problem in sub-Riemannian geometry
We study the local geometry of the space of horizontal curves with endpoints
freely varying in two given submanifolds $\mathcal P$ and $\mathcal Q$ of a
manifold $\mathcal M$ endowed with a distribution $\mathcal D\subset T\M$. We
give a different proof, that holds in a more general context, of a result by
Bismut (Large Deviations and the Malliavin Calculus, Birkhauser, 1984) stating
that the normal extremizers that are not abnormal are critical points of the
sub-Riemannian action functional. We use the Lagrangian multipliers method in a
Hilbert manifold setting, which leads to a characterization of the abnormal
extremizers (critical points of the endpoint map) as curves where the linear
constraint fails to be regular. Finally, we describe a modification of a result
by Liu and Sussmann that shows the global distance minimizing property of
sufficiently small portions of normal extremizers between a point and a
submanifold.
