Harmonic morphisms and shear-free ray congruences
We describe the relationship between complex-valued harmonic morphisms from
Minkowski 4-space} and the shear-free ray congruences of mathematical physics.
Then we show how a horizontally conformal submersion on a domain of Euclidean
3-space gives the boundary values at infinity of a complex-valued harmonic
morphism on hyperbolic 4-space.
