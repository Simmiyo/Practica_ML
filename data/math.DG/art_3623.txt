Lectures on generalized geometry
These are lecture notes mainly aimed at graduate students on selected aspects
of generalized geometry: in particular generalized complex and Kaehler
structures and generalized holomorphic bundles. They are based on lectures
given in March 2010 at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
