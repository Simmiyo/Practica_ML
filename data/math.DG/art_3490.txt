k-harmonic curves into a Riemannian manifold with constant sectional
  curvature
J.Eells and L. Lemaire introduced k-harmonic maps, and T. Ichiyama, J.
Inoguchi and H.Urakawa showed the first variation formula.
  In this paper, we describe the ordinary differential equations of
$3$-harmonic curves into a Riemannian manifold with constant sectional
curvature, and show biharmonic curve is k-harmonic curve $(k\geq 2)$.
