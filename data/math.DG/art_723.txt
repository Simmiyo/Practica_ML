Nonnegative curvature, symmetry and fundamental group
We prove a result on equivariant deformations of flat bundles, and as a
corollary, we obtain two ``splitting in a finite cover'' theorems for isometric
group actions on Riemannian manifolds with infinite fundamental groups, where
the manifolds are either compact of nonnegative Ricci curvature, or complete of
nonnegative sectional curvature.
