Connexions with totally skew-symmetric torsion and nearly-Kaehler
  geometry
We study almost Hermitian structures admitting a Hermitian connexion with
totally skew-symmetric torsion or equivalently, those almost Hermitian
structures with totally skew-symmetric Nijenhuis tensor. We investigate up to
what extent the Nijenhuis tensor fails to be parallel with respect to the
characteristic connexion. This is naturally described by means of an extension
of the notion of Killing form to almost Hermitian geometry. In this context, we
also make an essentially self-contained survey of nearly-Kaehler geometry, but
from the perspective of non-integrable holonomy systems.
