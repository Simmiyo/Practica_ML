Some basic properties of Lagrange spaces
Consider $L$ a regular Lagrangian, $S$ the canonical semispray, and $h$ the
horizontal projector of the canonical nonlinear connection. We prove that if
the Lagrangian is constant along the integral curves of the Euler-Lagrange
equations then it is constant along the horizontal curves of the canonical
nonlinear connection. In other words $S(L)=0$ implies $d_hL=0$. If the
Lagrangian $L$ is homogeneous of order $k\neq 1$ then $L$ is a conservation law
and hence $d_hL=0$. We give an example of nonhomogeneous Lagrangians for which
$d_hL\neq 0$.
