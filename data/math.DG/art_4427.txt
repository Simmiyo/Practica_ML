${\rm G}_2$-instantons on generalised Kummer constructions
In this article we introduce a method to construct $\rm{G}_2$-instantons on
$\rm{G}_2$-manifolds arising from Joyce's generalised Kummer construction. The
method is based on gluing ASD instantons over ALE spaces to flat bundles on
$\rm{G}_2$-orbifolds of the form $T^7/ \Gamma$. We use this construction to
produce non-trivial examples of $\rm{G}_2$-instantons.
