Slant submanifolds of quaternionic space forms
In this paper we establish some inequalities concerning the $k$-Ricci
curvature of a slant submanifold in a quaternionic space form. We also obtain
obstructions to the existence of quaternionic slant immersions in quaternionic
space forms with unfull first normal bundle.
