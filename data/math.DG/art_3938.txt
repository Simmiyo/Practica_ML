A lower bound for the scalar curvature of noncompact nonflat Ricci
  shrinkers
We show that recent work of Ni and Wilking yields the result that a
noncompact nonflat Ricci shrinker has at most quadratic scalar curvature decay.
The examples of noncompact K\"{a}hler--Ricci shrinkers by Feldman, Ilmanen, and
Knopf exhibit that this result is sharp.
