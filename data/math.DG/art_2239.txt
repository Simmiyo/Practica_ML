(a, 1)f structures on product of spheres
Our aim in this paper is to give some examples of $(a, 1)f$ Riemannian
structures (a generalization of an $r$-paracontact structure) induced on
product of spheres of codimension $r$ ($r \in \{1,2\} $) in an $m$-dimensional
Euclidean space ($m>2$), endowed with an almost product structure.
