On Special Berwald Metrics
In this paper, we study a class of Finsler metrics which contains the class
of Berwald metrics as a special case. We prove that every Finsler metric in
this class is a generalized Douglas-Weyl metric. Then we study isotropic flag
curvature Finsler metrics in this class. Finally we show that on this class of
Finsler metrics, the notion of Landsberg and weakly Landsberg curvature are
equivalent.
