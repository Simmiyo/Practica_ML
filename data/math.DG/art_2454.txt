On submanifolds with tamed second fundamental form
We show that a complete submanifold $M$ with tamed second fundamental form in
a complete Riemannian manifold $N$ with sectional curvature $K_{N}\leq \kappa
\leq 0$ are proper, (compact if $N$ is compact). In addition, if $N$ is
Hadamard then $M$ has finite topology. We also show that the fundamental tone
is an obstruction for a Riemannian manifold to be realized as submanifold with
tamed second fundamental form of a Hadamard manifold with sectional curvature
bounded below.
