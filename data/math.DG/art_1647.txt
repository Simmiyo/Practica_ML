Capillary channels in a gravitational field
The liquid shape between two vertical parallel plates in a gravity field due
to capillary forces is studied. When the physical system achieves its
mechanical equilibrium, the capillary surface has mean curvature proportional
to its height above a horizontal reference plane and it meets the vertical
walls in a prescribed angle. We examine the shapes of these interfaces and
their qualitative properties depending on the sign of the capillary constant.
We focus to obtain estimates of the size of the meniscus, as for example, its
height and volume.
