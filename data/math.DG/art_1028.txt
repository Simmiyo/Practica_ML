Geometrie affine Geometrie symplectique
Let (M,w,L) be a symplectic manifold endowed with a lagrangian foliation L.
Liberman and Weinstein have shown that the leaves of L are endowed with an
affine structure. In this paper we provide links between the theories of affine
manifolds and symplectic geometry. Using the work of Donaldson who have shown
the existence of symplectic submanifolds in every codimension, we show the
Auslander conjecture to be true if the linear holonomy is contained in
  Gl(n,Z)
