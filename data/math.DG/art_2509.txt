A limit-method for solving period problems on minimal surfaces
We introduce a new technique to solve period problems on minimal surfaces
called limit-method. If a family of surfaces has Weierstrass-data converging to
the data of a known example, and this presents a transversal solution of
periods, then the original family contains a sub-family with closed periods.
