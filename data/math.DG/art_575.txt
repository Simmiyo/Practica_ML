Surfaces in S^3 and H^3 via Spinors
We generalize the spinorial characterization of isometric immersions of
surfaces in R^3 given by T. Friedrich (On the spinor representation of surfaces
in Euclidean 3-space, J. Geom. Phys. 28 (1998)) to surfaces in S^3 and H^3. The
main argument is the interpretation of the energy-momentum tensor associated
with a special spinor field as a second fundamental form. It turns out that
such a characterization of isometric immersions in terms of a special section
of the spinor bundle also holds in the case of hypersurfaces in the Euclidean
4-space.
