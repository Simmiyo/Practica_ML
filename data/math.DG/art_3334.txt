Projectively flat connections and flat connections on homogeneous spaces
We show a correspondence between the set of all G-invariant projectively flat
connections on a homogeneous apace $M=G/K$, and the one of all {G}^~-invariant
flat connections on a homogeneous space {M}^~={G}^~/K, where {G}^~ is a central
extension of G.
