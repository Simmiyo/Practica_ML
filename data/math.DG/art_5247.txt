A volume stability theorem on toric manifolds with positive Ricci
  curvature
In this short note, we will prove a volume stability theorem which says that
if an n-dimensional toric manifold $M$ admits a $\mathbb{T}^n$ invariant
K\"ahler metric $\omega$ with Ricci curvature no less than 1 and its volume is
close to the volume of $\mathbb{CP}^n$, $M$ is bi-holomorphic to
$\mathbb{CP}^n$.
