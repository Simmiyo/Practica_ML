A necessary and sufficient condition for Ricci shrinkers to have
  positive AVR
In this short note we observe that a recent result of C.-W. Chen meshes well
with earlier work of H.-D. Cao and D.-T. Zhou, O. Munteanu, J. Carrillo and L.
Ni, and S.-J. Zhang to give a necessary and sufficient condition for complete
noncompact shrinking gradient Ricci solitons to have positive asymptotic volume
ratio.
