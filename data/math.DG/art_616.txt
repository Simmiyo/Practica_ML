Sur la L2-cohomologie des varietes a courbure negative
We give a topological interpretation of the space of L2-harmonic forms on
finite-volume manifolds with sufficiently pinched negative curvature. We give
examples showing that this interpretation fails if the curvature is not
sufficiently pinched and that our result is sharp with respect to the pinching
constants. The method consists first in comparing L2-cohomology with weighted
L2-cohomology thanks to previuos works done by T. Ohsawa, and then in
identifying these weighted spaces.
