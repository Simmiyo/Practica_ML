Self Dual Einstein Orbifolds with Few Symmetries as Quaternion Kaehler
  Quotients
We construct a new family of compact orbifolds with a positive self dual
Einstein metric and a one-dimensional group of isometries. Together with
another known family, these examples classify all 4-dimensional orbifolds that
are quaternion Kaehler quotients by a torus of real Grassmannians.
