Anisotropic umbilic points and Hopf's Theorem for surfaces with constant
  anisotropic mean curvature
We show that for elliptic parametric functionals whose Wulff shape is smooth
and has strictly positive curvature, any surface with constant anisotropic mean
curvature which is a topological sphere is a rescaling of the Wulff shape.
