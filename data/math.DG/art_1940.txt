On local geometry of nonholonomic rank 2 distributions
In 1910 E. Cartan constructed a canonical frame and found the most symmetric
case for maximally nonholonomic rank 2 distributions in $\mathbb R^5$. We solve
the analogous problem for germs of generic rank 2 distributions in ${\mathbb
R}^n$ for n>5. We use a completely different approach based on the
symplectification of the problem. The main idea is to consider a special
odd-dimensional submanifold $W_D$ of the cotangent bundle associated with any
rank 2 distribution D. It is naturally foliated by characteristic curves, which
are also called the abnormal extremals of the distribution D. The dynamics of
vertical fibers along characteristic curves defines certain curves of flags of
isotropic and coisotropic subspaces in a linear symplectic space. Using the
classical theory of curves in projective spaces, we construct the canonical
frame of the distribution D on a certain (2n-1)-dimensional fiber bundle over
$W_D$ with the structure group of all M\"obius transformations, preserving 0.
