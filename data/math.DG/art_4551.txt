Bounds for the first eigenvalue of the horizontal Laplacian in
  positively curved sub-Riemannian manifolds
We establish lower bounds for the first non-zero eigenvalue for the natural
geometric sub-elliptic Laplacian operator defined on sub-Riemannian manifolds
of step 2 that satisfy a positive curvature condition. The methods are very
general and can be applied even when the sub-Riemannian geometry has
considerable torsion.
