Some examples of self-similar solutions and translating solitons for
  mean curvature flow
We construct new examples of self-similar solutions and translating solitons
for Lagrangian mean curvature flow by extending the method of Joyce, Lee and
Tsui. Those examples include examples in which the Lagrangian angle is
arbitrarily small as the examples of Joyce, Lee and Tsui.
