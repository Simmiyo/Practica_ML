Hypercomplex structures on Courant algebroids
Hypercomplex structures on Courant algebroids unify holomorphic symplectic
structures and usual hypercomplex structures. In this note, we prove the
equivalence of two characterizations of hypercomplex structures on Courant
algebroids, one in terms of Nijenhuis concomitants and the other in terms of
(almost) torsionfree connections for which each of the three complex structures
is parallel.
