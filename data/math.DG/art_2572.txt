Hyperpolar homogeneous foliations on symmetric spaces of noncompact type
A foliation on a Riemannian manifold is hyperpolar if it admits a flat
section, that is, a connected closed flat submanifold that intersects each leaf
of the foliation orthogonally. In this article we classify the hyperpolar
homogeneous foliations on every Riemannian symmetric space of noncompact type.
