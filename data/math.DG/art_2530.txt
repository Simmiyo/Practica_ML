Distinguished Torsion, Curvature and Deflection Tensors in the
  Multi-Time Hamilton Geometry
The aim of this paper is to present the main geometrical objects on the dual
1-jet bundle $J^{1*}(\cal{T},M)$ (this is the polymomentum phase space of the
De Donder-Weyl covariant Hamiltonian formulation of field theory) that
characterize our approach of multi-time Hamilton geometry. In this direction,
we firstly introduce the geometrical concept of a nonlinear connection $N$ on
the dual 1-jet space $J^{1*}(\cal{T},M)$. Then, starting with a given
$N$-linear connection $D$ on $J^{1*}(\cal{T},M)$, we describe the adapted
components of the torsion, curvature and deflection distinguished tensors
attached to the $N$-linear connection $D$.
