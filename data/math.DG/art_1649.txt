On Weitzenböck Curvature Operators
The Weitzenb\"ock curvature operators are the curvature terms of order zero
that appear in the well known classical Weitzenb\"ock formula. In this paper,
we use the formalism of double forms to prove a simple formula for this
operators and to study their geometric properties.
