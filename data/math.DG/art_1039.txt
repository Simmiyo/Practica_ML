Normal Conformal Killing Forms
We introduce in this paper normal twistor equations for differential forms
and study their solutions, the so-called normal conformal Killing forms. The
twistor equations arise naturally from the canonical normal Cartan connection
of conformal geometry. Reductions of its holonomy are related to solutions of
the normal twistor equations. The case of decomposable normal conformal
holonomy representations is discussed. A typical example with an irreducible
holonomy representation are the so-called Fefferman spaces. We also apply our
results to describe the geometry of solutions with conformal Killing spinors on
Lorentzian spin manifolds.
