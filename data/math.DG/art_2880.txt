Discontinuities of plane functions projected from a surface with methods
  for finding these
A result is given to find points where a real valued function on the plane is
not smooth. Provided this function is induced by a smooth mapping from three
dimensions to the plane, from a function on surfaces in three dimensions. This
has applications to numerical methods such as image processing.
