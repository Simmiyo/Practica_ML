Relating diameter and mean curvature for Riemannian submanifolds
Given an $m$-dimensional closed connected Riemannian manifold $M$ smoothly
isometrically immersed in an $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $N$, we
estimate the diameter of $M$ in terms of its mean curvature field integral
under some geometric restrictions, and therefore generalize a recent work of
Topping in the Euclidean case (Comment. Math. Helv., 83 (2008), 539--546).
