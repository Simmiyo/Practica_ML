Generalized special Lagrangian torus fibration for Calabi-Yau
  hypersurfaces in toric varieties I
In this paper we start the program of constructing generalized special
Lagrangian torus fibrations for Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric variety near
the large complex limit, with respect to the restriction of a toric metric on
the toric variety to the Calabi-Yau hypersurface. The construction is based on
the deformation of the standard toric generalized special Lagrangian torus
fibration of the large complex limit $X_0$. In this paper, we will deal with
the region near the smooth top dimensional torus fibres of $X_0$ and its mirror
dual situation: the region near the 0-dimensional fibres of $X_0$.
