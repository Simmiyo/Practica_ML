The treadmillsled of a curve
In a previous paper the author introduced the notion of TreadmillSled of a
curve, which is an operator that takes regular curves in R^2 to curves in R^2.
This operator turned out to be very useful to describe helicoidal surfaces, for
example, it provides an interpretation for the profile curve of helicoidal
surfaces with constant mean curvature similar to the well known interpretation
of the profile curve of Delaunay's surfaces using conics. Recentely, Palmer and
Kuhns used the TreadmillSled to classify all helicoidal surfaces with constant
anisotropic mean curvature coming from axially symmetric anisotropic energy
density. Also the author proved that an helicoidal surface different from a
cylinder has constant Gauss curvature if and only if the TreadmillSled of its
profile curve lies in a vertical semi line contained in the lower or upper half
plane and not contained in the y-axis... Why not the whole vertical line? and
why the semi-line cannot be contained in the y-axis? In this paper we provide
several properties of the TreadmillSled operator, in particular we will answer
the questions in the previous sentence. Finally, we prove that the
TreadmillSled of the profile curve of a minimal helicoidal surface is either a
hyperbola or a the x-axis. The latter case occurs only when the surface is a
helicoid.
