Remarks on an inequality involving the normal scalar curvature
We study a pointwise inequality for submanifolds in real space forms
involving the scalar curvature, the normal scalar curvature and the mean
curvature. We translate it into an algebraic problem, allowing us to prove a
slightly weaker version of it. We also prove the conjecture for certain types
of submanifolds of $\mathbb C^n$.
