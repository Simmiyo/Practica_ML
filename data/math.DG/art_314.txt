Broadly-Pluriminimal Submanifolds of Kaehler-Einstein Manifolds
We define broadly-pluriminimal immersed 2n-submanifold F: M --> N into a
Kaehler-Einstein manifold of complex dimension 2n and scalar curvature R. We
prove that, if M is compact, n \geq 2, and R < 0, then: (i) Either F has
complex or Lagrangian directions; (ii) If n = 2, M is oriented, and F has no
complex directions, then it is a Lagrangian submanifold, generalising the
well-known case n = 1 for minimal surfaces due to Wolfson. We also prove that,
if F has constant Kaehler angles with no complex directions, and is not
Lagrangian, then R = 0 must hold. Our main tool is a formula on the Laplacian
of a symmetric function on the Kaehler angles.
