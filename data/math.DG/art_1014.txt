Estimating the eigenvalues on Quaternionic Kähler Manifolds
We study geometric first order differential operators on quaternionic
K\"ahler manifolds. Their principal symbols are related to the enveloping
algebra and Casimir elements for $\Sp(1)\Sp(n)$. This observation leads to
anti-symmetry of the principal symbols and Bochner-Weitzenb\"ock formulas for
operators. As an application, we estimate the first eigenvalues of them.
