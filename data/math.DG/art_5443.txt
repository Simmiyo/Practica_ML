On a Class of Two-Dimensional Singular Douglas and Projectively flat
  Finsler Metrics
Singular Finsler metrics, such as Kropina metrics and $m$-Kropina metrics,
have a lot of applications in the real world. In this paper, we study a class
of two-dimensional singular Finsler metrics defined by a Riemann metric
$\alpha$ and 1-form $\beta$, and we characterize those which are Douglasian or
locally projectively flat by some equations. It shows that the main class
induced is an $m$-Kropina metric plus a linear part on $\beta$. For this class,
the local structure of Douglasian or (in part) projectively flat case is
determined, and in particular we show that a Kropina metric is always
Douglasian and a Douglas $m$-Kropina metric with $m\ne -1$ is locally
Minkowskian. It indicates that the two-dimensional case is quite different from
the higher dimensional ones.
