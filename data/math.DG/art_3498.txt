Stokes' theorem, volume growth and parabolicity
We present some new Stokes' type theorems on complete non-compact manifolds
that extend, in different directions, previous work by Gaffney and Karp and
also the so called Kelvin-Nevanlinna-Royden criterion for (p-)parabolicity.
Applications to comparison and uniqueness results involving the p-Laplacian are
deduced.
