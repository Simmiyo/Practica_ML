A Novel Solution to the Frenet-Serret Equations
A set of equations is developed to describe a curve in space given the
curvature $\kappa$ and the angle of rotation $\theta$ of the osculating plane.
The set of equations has a solution (in terms of $\kappa$ and $\theta$) that
indirectly solves the Frenet-Serret equations, with a unique value of $\theta$
for each specified value of $\tau$. Explicit solutions can be generated for
constant $\theta$. The equations break down when the tangent vector aligns to
one of the unit coordinate vectors, requiring a reorientation of the local
coordinate system.
