Classification of connected holonomy groups of pseudo-Kählerian
  manifolds of index 2
The problem of classification of connected holonomy groups (equivalently of
holonomy algebras) for pseudo-Riemannian manifolds is open. The classification
of Riemannian holonomy algebras is a classical result. The classification of
Lorentzian holonomy algebras was obtained recently.
  In the present paper weakly-irreducible not irreducible subalgebras of
$\su(1,n+1)$ ($n\geq 0$) are classified. Weakly-irreducible not irreducible
holonomy algebras of pseudo-K\"ahlerian and special pseudo-K\"ahlerian
manifolds are classified. An example of metric for each possible holonomy
algebra is given. This gives the classification of holonomy algebras for
pseudo-K\"ahlerian manifolds of index 2
