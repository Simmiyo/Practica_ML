Subsequent Singularities in Mean-Convex Mean Curvature Flow
We use Ilmanen's elliptic regularization to prove that for an initially
smooth mean convex hypersurface in Euclidean n-space moving by mean curvature
flow, the surface is very nearly convex in a spacetime neighborhood of every
singularity. Previously this was known only (i) for n < 7, and (ii) for
arbitrary n up to the first singular time.
