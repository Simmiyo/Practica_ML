The sharp lower bound of the first eigenvalue of the sub-Laplacian on a
  quaternionic contact manifold in dimension seven
A version of Lichnerowicz' theorem giving a lower bound of the eigenvalues of
the sub-Laplacian under a lower bound on the Sp(1)Sp(1) component of the
qc-Ricci curvature on a compact seven dimensional quaternionic contact manifold
is established. It is shown that in the case of a seven dimensional compact
3-Sasakian manifold the lower bound is reached if and only if the quaternionic
contact manifold is a round 3-Sasakian sphere.
