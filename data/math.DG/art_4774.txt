Cylindrically bounded constant mean curvature surfaces in
  $\mathbb{H}^2\times\mathbb{R}$
In this paper we prove that a properly embedded constant mean curvature
surface in $\mathbb{H}^2\times\mathbb{R}$ which has finite topology and stays
at a finite distance from a vertical geodesic line is invariant by rotation
around a vertical geodesic line.
