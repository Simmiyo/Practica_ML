Mean time exit and isoperimetric inequalities \\for minimal submanifolds
  of $N\times \mathbb{R}$
Based on Markvorsen and Palmer's work on mean time exit and isoperimetric
inequalities we establish slightly better isoperimetric inequalities and mean
time exit estimates for minimal submanifolds of $N\times\mathbb{R}$. We also
prove isoperimetric inequalities for submanifolds of Hadamard spaces with tamed
second fundamental form.
