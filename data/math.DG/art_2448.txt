Compact complete proper minimal immersions in strictly convex bounded
  regular domains of R^3
Consider a strictly convex bounded regular domain $C$ of $\R^3$. For any
arbitrary finite topological type we find a compact Riemann surface
$\mathcal{M}$, an open domain $M\subset \mathcal{M}$ with the fixed topological
type, and a conformal complete proper minimal immersion $X:M\to C$ which can be
extended to a continuous map $X:\overline{M}\to \overline{C}$.
