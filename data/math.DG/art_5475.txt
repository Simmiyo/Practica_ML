HCMU metrics with cusp singularities and conical singularities
An HCMU metric is a conformal metric which has a finite number of
singularities on a compact Riemann surface and satisfies the equation of the
extremal K\"{a}hler metric. In this paper, we give a necessary and sufficient
condition for the existence of a kind of HCMU metrics which has both cusp
singularities and conical singularities.
