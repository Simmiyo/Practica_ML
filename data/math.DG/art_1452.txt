Comparison Theorems in Finsler Geometry and their Applications
We prove Hessian comparison theorems, Laplacian comparison theorems and
volume comparison theorems of Finsler manifolds under various curvature
conditions. As applications, we derive Mckean type theorems for the first
eigenvalue of Finsler manifolds, as well as generalize a result on fundamental
group due to Milnor to Finsler manifolds.
