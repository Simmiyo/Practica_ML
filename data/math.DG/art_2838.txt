Examples of $H$-hypersurfaces in $H^n \times R$ and geometric
  applications
In this paper we describe all rotation $H$-hypersurfaces in $H^n \times R$
and use them as barriers to prove existence and characterization of certain
vertical $H$-graphs and to give symmetry and uniqueness results for compact
$H$-hypersurfaces whose boundary is one or two parallel submanifolds in slices.
We also describe examples of translation $H$-hypersurfaces in $H^n \times R$.
For $n>2$ we obtain a complete embedded translation hypersurface generated by a
compact, simple, strictly convex curve. When $0 < H < \frac{n-1}{n}$ we obtain
a complete non-entire vertical graph over the non-mean convex domain bounded by
an equidistant hypersurface taking infinite boundary value data and infinite
asymptotic boundary value data.
