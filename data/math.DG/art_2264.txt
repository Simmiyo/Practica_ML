Dimensional reduction and the long-time behavior of Ricci flow
If g(t) is a three-dimensional Ricci flow solution, with sectional curvatures
that decay like the inverse of t and diameter that increases at most like the
square root of t, then the pullback Ricci flow solution on the universal cover
approaches a homogeneous expanding soliton.
