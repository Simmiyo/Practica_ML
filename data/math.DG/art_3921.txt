Combinatorial differential geometry and ideal Bianchi-Ricci identities
  II - the torsion case
This paper is a continuation of arXiv:0809.1158, dealing with a general,
not-necessarily torsion-free, connection. It characterizes all possible systems
of generators for vector-field valued operators that depend naturally on a set
of vector fields and a linear connection, describes the size of the space of
such operators and proves the existence of an `ideal' basis consisting of
operators with given leading terms which satisfy the (generalized)
Bianchi-Ricci identities without corrections.
