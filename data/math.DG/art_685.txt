Orbits of certain endomorphisms of nilmanifolds and Hausdorff dimension
We prove that for certain endomorphisms of a nilmanifold N the set S of those
points such that the closure of its (forward) orbit contains no periodic points
is large in the sense that for any non-empty open set U, the set U\cap S is of
full Hausdorff dimension. When the manifold N is a torus, this result is due to
S.G.Dani.
