Adding one handle to half-plane layers
In this paper, we build properly embedded singly periodic minimal surfaces
which have infinite total curvature in the quotient by the period. These
surfaces are constructed by adding a handle to the toroidal half-plane layers
defined by H. Karcher. The technics that use is to solve a Jenkins-Serrin
problem over a strip domain and to consider the conjugate minimal surface to
the graph.
