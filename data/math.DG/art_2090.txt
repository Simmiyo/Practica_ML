Manifolds with nonnegative isotropic curvature
We prove that if $(M^n,g)$, $n \ge 4$, is a compact, orientable, locally
irreducible Riemannian manifold with nonnegative isotropic curvature, then one
of the following possibilities hold:
  (i) $M$ admits a metric with positive isotropic curvature
  (ii) $(M,g)$ is isometric to a locally symmetric space
  (iii) $(M,g)$ is K\"ahler and biholomorphic to $\C P^\frac {n}{2}$.
  (iv) $(M,g)$ is quaternionic-K\"ahler.
  This is implied by the following result:
  Let $(M^{2n},g)$ be a compact, locally irreducible K\"ahler manifold with
nonnegative isotropic curvature. Then either $M$ is biholomorphic to $\C P^n$
or isometric to a compact Hermitian symmetric space. This answers a question of
Micallef and Wang in the affirmative.
  The proof is based on the recent work of S. Brendle and R. Schoen on the
Ricci flow.
