Representations of compact Lie groups and the osculating spaces of their
  orbits
Several classes of irreducible orthogonal representations of compact Lie
groups that are of importance in Differential Geometry have the property that
the second osculating spaces of all of their nontrivial orbits coincide with
the representation space. We say that representations with this property are of
class O^2. Our approach in the present paper will be to find restrictions on
the class O^2 and then apply them to classify variationally complete and taut
representations. The known classifications of cohomogeneity one and two
orthogonal representations and more generally of polar representations will
also follow easily.
