Ricci-Flat Holonomy: a Classification
The reductive holonomy algebras for a torsion-free affine connection are
analysed, with the goal of establishing which ones can correspond to a
Ricci-flat connection with the same properties. Various families of holonomies
are eliminated through different algebraic means, and examples are constructed
(in this paper and in `Projective Geometry II: Holonomy Classification', by the
same author) in the remaining cases, thus solving this problem completely, for
reductive holonomy.
