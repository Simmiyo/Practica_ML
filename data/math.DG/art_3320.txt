The decomposition of Global Conformal Invariants V
This is the fifth in a series of papers where we prove a conjecture of Deser
and Schwimmer regarding the algebraic structure of ``global conformal
invariants''; these are defined to be conformally invariant integrals of
geometric scalars. The conjecture asserts that the integrand of any such
integral can be expressed as a linear combination of a local conformal
invariant, a divergence and of the Chern-Gauss-Bonnet integrand.
  The present paper complements [6] in reducing the purely algebraic results
that were used in [3,4 to certain simpler Lemmas, which will be proven in the
last paper in this series, [8].
