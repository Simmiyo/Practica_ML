Spin(9) geometry of the octonionic Hopf fibration
We deal with Riemannian properties of the octonionic Hopf fibration
S^{15}-->S^8, in terms of the structure given by its symmetry group Spin(9). In
particular, we show that any vertical vector field has at least one zero, thus
reproving the non-existence of S^1 subfibrations. We then discuss
Spin(9)-structures from a conformal viewpoint and determine the structure of
compact locally conformally parallel Spin(9)-manifolds. Eventually, we give a
list of examples of locally conformally parallel Spin(9)-manifolds.
