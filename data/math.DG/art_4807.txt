An integral formula on the Heisenberg group
Let Hn denote the (2n + 1)-dimensional (sub-Riemannian) Heisenberg group. In
this note, we shall prove an integral identity (see Theorem 1.2) which
generalizes a formula obtained in the Seventies by Reilly. Some first
applications will be given in Section 4.
