Interior curvature estimates and the asymptotic plateau problem in
  hyperbolic space
We show that for a very general class of curvature functions defined in the
positive cone, the problem of finding a complete strictly locally convex
hypersurface in $H^n+1$ satisfying $f(\kappa)=\sigma\in(0, 1)$ with a
prescribed asymptotic boundary $\Gamma$ at infinity has at least one smooth
solution with uniformly bounded hyperbolic principal curvatures. Moreover if
$\Gamma$ is (Euclidean) starshaped, the solution is unique and also (Euclidean)
starshaped while if $\Gamma$ is mean convex the solution is unique. We also
show via a strong duality theorem that analogous results hold in De Sitter
space. A novel feature of our approach is a "global interior curvature
estimate".
