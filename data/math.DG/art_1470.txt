Minimal Lagrangian surfaces in $S^2 \times S^2$
We deal with the minimal Lagrangian surfaces of the Einstein-K\"ahler surface
$S^2 \times S^2$, studying local geometric properties and showing that they can
be locally described as Gauss maps of minimal surfaces in $S^3 \subset R^4$. We
also discuss the second variation of the area and characterize the most
relevant examples by their stability behaviour.
