Classification of solvable 3-dimensional Lie triple systems
We give the classification of solvable and splitting Lie triple system and it
turn that, up to isomorphism there exist 7 non isomorphic canonical Lie triple
systems and 6 non isomorphic splitting canonical Lie triple systems and find
the solvable Lie algebras associated.
