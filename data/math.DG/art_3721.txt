Group Analysis of Born-Infeld Equation
Lie symmetry group method is applied to study the Born-Infeld equation. The
symmetry group and its optimal system are given, and group invariant solutions
associated to the symmetries are obtained. Finally the structure of the Lie
algebra symmetries is determined.
