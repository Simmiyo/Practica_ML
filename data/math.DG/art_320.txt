Isospectral deformations of metrics on spheres
We construct non-trivial continuous isospectral deformations of Riemannian
metrics on the ball and on the sphere in $\R^n$ for every $n\geq 9$. The
metrics on the sphere can be chosen arbitrarily close to the round metric; in
particular, they can be chosen to be positively curved. The metrics on the ball
are both Dirichlet and Neumann isospectral and can be chosen arbitrarily close
to the flat metric.
