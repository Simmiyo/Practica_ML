The construction of doubly periodic minimal surfaces via balance
  equations
Using Traizet's regeneration method, we prove the existence of many new
3-dimensional families of embedded, doubly periodic minimal surfaces. All these
families have a foliation of 3-dimensional Euclidean space by vertical planes
as a limit. In the quotient, these limits can be realized conformally as noded
Riemann surfaces, whose components are copies of C* with finitely many nodes.
We derive the balance equations for the location of the nodes and exhibit
solutions that allow for surfaces of arbitrarily large genus and number of ends
in the quotient.
