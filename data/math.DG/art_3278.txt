Partial Classification Results for Positive Quaternion Kaehler Manifolds
Positive Quaternion Kaehler Manifolds are Riemannian manifolds with holonomy
contained in Sp(n)Sp(1) and with positive scalar curvature. Conjecturally, they
are symmetric spaces. We prove this conjecture in dimension 20 under additional
assumptions and we provide recognition theorems for quaternionic projective
spaces (in low dimensions) as well as the real Grassmanian (which is Positive
Quaternion Kaehler).
