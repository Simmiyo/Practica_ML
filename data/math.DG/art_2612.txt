Non-Walker Self-Dual Neutral Einstein Four-Manifolds of Petrov Type III
The local structure of the manifolds named in the title is described.
Although curvature homogeneous, they are not, in general, locally homogeneous.
Not all of them are Ricci-flat, which answers an existence question about type
III Jordan-Osserman metrics, raised by Diaz-Ramos, Garcia-Rio and
Vazquez-Lorenzo (2006).
