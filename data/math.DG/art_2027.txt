Positive Complex Sectional Curvature, Ricci Flow and the Differential
  Sphere Theorem
The paper provides a different proof of the result of Brendle-Schoen on the
differential sphere theorem. It is shown directly that the invariant cone of
curvature operators with positive (or non-negative) complex sectional curvature
is preserved by the Ricci flow. This implies, by a result of B\"ohm-Wilking,
that the normalized Ricci flow deforms such a metric to a metric of constant
positive curvature. Using earlier work of Yau and Zheng it can be shown that a
metric with strictly (pointwise) 1/4-pinched sectional curvature has positive
complex sectional curvature. This gives a direct proof of Brendle-Schoen's
recent differential sphere theorem, bypassing any discussion of positive
isotropic curvature.
