Geometry of neutral metrics in dimesnion four
The purpose of this article is to review some recent results on the geometry
of neutral signature metrics in dimension four and their twistor spaces. The
following topics are considered: Neutral K\"ahler and hyperk\"ahler surfaces,
Walker metrics, Neutral anti-self-dual 4-manifolds and projective structures,
Twistor spaces of neutral metrics.
