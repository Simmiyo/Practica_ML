Dolbeault Cohomology of compact Nilmanifolds
Let $M= G/\Gamma$ be a compact nilmanifold endowed with an invariant complex
structure. We prove that, on an open set of any connected component of the
moduli space ${\cal C} ({\frak g})$ of invariant complex structures on $M$, the
Dolbeault cohomology of $M$ is isomorphic to the one of the differential
bigraded algebra associated to the complexification $\cg^\C$ of the Lie algebra
of $G$. To obtain this result, we first prove the above isomorphism for compact
nilmanifolds endowed with a rational invariant complex structure. This is done
using a descending series associated to the complex structure and the Borel
spectral sequences for the corresponding set of holomorphic fibrations. Then we
apply the theory of Kodaira-Spencer for deformations of complex structures.
