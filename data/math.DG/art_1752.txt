Noncompact homogeneous Einstein manifolds attached to graded Lie
  algebras
In this paper, we study the nilradicals of parabolic subalgebras of
semisimple Lie algebras and the natural one-dimensional solvable extensions of
them. We investigate the structures, curvatures and Einstein conditions of the
associated nilmanifolds and solvmanifolds. We show that our solvmanifold is
Einstein if the nilradical is of two-step. New examples of Einstein
solvmanifolds with three-step and four-step nilradicals are also given.
