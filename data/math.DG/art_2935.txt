On Chapter Xii in Cartan's "LeÇONS Sur la GÉOMÉTRIE Des
  Espaces De Riemann"
One shows that Cartan's method of adapted frames in Chapter XII of his famous
treatise of Riemannian geometry, leads to a classification theorem of
homogeneous Riemannian manifolds. Examples of classification in 3D dimensions
obtained by Cartan are given using this powerful method.
