Irreducible holonomy algebras of Riemannian supermanifolds
Possible irreducible holonomy algebras $\g\subset\osp(p,q|2m)$ of Riemannian
supermanifolds under the assumption that $\g$ is a direct sum of simple Lie
superalgebras of classical type and possibly of a one-dimensional center are
classified. This generalizes the classical result of Marcel Berger about the
classification of irreducible holonomy algebras of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds.
