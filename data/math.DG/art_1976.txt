Some smooth Finsler deformations of hyperbolic surfaces
Given a closed hyperbolic Riemannian surface, the aim of the present paper is
to describe an explicit construction of smooth deformations of the hyperbolic
metric into Finsler metrics that are not Riemannian and whose properties are
such that the classical Riemannian results about entropy rigidity, marked
length spectrum rigidity and boundary rigidity all fail to extend to the
Finsler category.
