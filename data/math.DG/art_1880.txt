Linear Connections on Light-like Manifolds
It is well-known that a torsion-free linear connection on a light-like
manifold $(M,g)$ compatible with the degenerate metric $g$ exists if and only
if $Rad(TM)$ is a Killing distribution. In case of existence, there is an
infinitude of connections with none distinguished. We propose a method to
single out connections with the help of a special set of 1-forms by the
condition that the 1-forms become parallel with respect to this connection.
Such sets of 1-forms could be regarded as an additional structure imposed upon
the light-like manifold. We consider also connections with torsion and with
non-metricity on light-like manifolds.
