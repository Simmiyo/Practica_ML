Biharmonic conformal immersions into 3-dimensional manifolds
Motivated by the beautiful theory and the rich applications of harmonic
conformal immersions and conformal immersions of constant mean curvature (CMC)
surfaces, we study biharmonic conformal immersions of surfaces into a generic
3-manifold. We first derive an invariant equation for such immersions, we then
try to answer the question, "what surfaces can be biharmonically conformally
immersed into Euclidean 3-space?" We prove that a circular cylinder is the only
CMC surface that can be biharmonically conformally immersed into a Euclidean
3-space; We obtain a classification of biharmonic conformal immersions of
complete CMC surfaces into a Euclidean 3-space and a hyperbolic 3-spaces. We
also study rotational surfaces that can be biharmonically conformally immersed
into a Euclidean 3-space and prove that a circular cone can never such an
immersion.
