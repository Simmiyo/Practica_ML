Integrable geometries and Monge-Ampere equations
In this lecture delivered at the Integrable and Quantum Field Theory at
Peyresq sixth meeting, we review the Lychagin's Monge-Ampere operators theory
and exhibit the link it establishes between the classical problem of local
equivalence for non linear partial differential equations and the problem of
integrability of some geometrical structures.
