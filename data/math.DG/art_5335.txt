On the fundamental tone of minimal submanifolds with controlled
  extrinsic curvature
The aim of this paper is to obtain the fundamental tone for minimal
submanifolds of the Euclidean or hyperbolic space under certain restrictions on
the extrinsic curvature. We show some sufficient conditions on the norm of the
second fundamental form that allow us to obtain the same upper and lower bound
for the fundamental tone of minimal submanifolds in a Cartan-Hadamard ambient
manifold. As an intrinsic result, we obtain a sufficient condition on the
volume growth of a Cartan-Hadamard manifold to achieve the lowest bound for the
fundamental tone given by McKean.
