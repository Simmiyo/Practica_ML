On the spinorial representation of spacelike surfaces into 4-dimensional
  Minkowski space
We prove that an isometric immersion of a simply connected Riemannian surface
M in four-dimensional Minkowski space, with given normal bundle E and given
mean curvature vector H \in \Gamma(E), is equivalent to a normalized spinor
field \varphi \in \Gamma(\Sigma E \otimes \Sigma M) solution of a Dirac
equation D\varphi=H\cdot\varphi on the surface. Using the immersion of the
Minkowski space into the complex quaternions, we also obtain a representation
of the immersion in terms of the spinor field. We then use these results to
describe the flat spacelike surfaces with flat normal bundle and regular Gauss
map in four-dimensional Minkowski space, and also the flat surfaces in
three-dimensional hyperbolic space, giving spinorial proofs of results by J.A.
