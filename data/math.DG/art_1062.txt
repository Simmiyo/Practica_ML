On the geometry of variational calculus on some functional bundles
We first generalize the operation of formal exterior differential in the case
of finite dimensional fibered manifolds and then we extend it to certain
bundles of smooth maps. In order to characterize the operator order of some
morphisms between our bundles of smooth maps, we introduce the concept of
fiberwise $(k,r)$-jet. The relations to the Euler-Lagrange morphism of the
variational calculus are described.
