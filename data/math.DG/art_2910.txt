On compact holomorphically pseudosymmetric Kählerian manifolds
For compact K\"ahlerian manifolds, the holomorphic pseudosymmetry reduces to
the local symmetry if additionally the scalar curvature is constant and the
structure function is non-negative. Similarly, the holomorphic
Ricci-pseudosymmetry reduces to the Ricci-symmetry under these additional
assumptions. We construct examples of non-compact essentially holomorphically
pseudosymmetric K\"ahlerian manifolds. These examples show that the compactness
assumption cannot be omitted in the above stated theorem.
  Recently, the first examples of compact, simply connected essentially
holomorphically pseudosymmetric K\"ahlerian manifolds are discovered by W.
Jelonek. In his examples, the structure functions change their signs on the
manifold.
