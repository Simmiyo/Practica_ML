On the Extension of the Calabi Flow on Toric Varieties
Inspired by recent work of S. K. Donaldson on constant scalar curvature
metrics on toric complex surfaces, we study obstructions to the extension of
the Calabi flow on a polarized toric variety. Under some technical assumptions,
we prove that the Calabi flow can be extended for all time.
