On the Unboundedness of the First Eigenvalue of the Laplacian for
  G-Invariant Metrics
In this note we partially answer a question posed by Colbois, Dryden, and El
Soufi. Consider the space of constant-volume Riemannian metrics on a connected
manifold M which are invariant under the action of a discrete Lie group G. We
show that the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian is not bounded above on this
space, provided M = S^n, G acts freely, and S^n/G with the round metric admits
a Killing vector field of constant length, or provided M is a compact Lie group
not equal to T^n, and G is a discrete subgroup of M.
