The profile of bubbling solutions of a class of fourth order geometric
  equations on 4-manifolds
We study a class of fourth order geometric equations defined on a
4-dimensional compact Riemannian manifold which includes the Q-curvature
equation. We obtain sharp estimates on the difference near the blow-up points
between a bubbling sequence of solutions and the standard bubble.
