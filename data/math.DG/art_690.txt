Non-linear partial differential equations in conformal geometry
In the study of conformal geometry, the method of elliptic partial
differential equations is playing an increasingly significant role. Since the
solution of the Yamabe problem, a family of conformally covariant operators
(for definition, see section 2) generalizing the conformal Laplacian, and their
associated conformal invariants have been introduced. The conformally covariant
powers of the Laplacian form a family $P_{2k}$ with $k \in \mathbb N$ and $k
\leq \frac{n}{2}$ if the dimension $n$ is even. Each $P_{2k}$ has leading order
term $(- \Delta)^k$ and is equal to $ (- \Delta) ^k$ if the metric is flat.
