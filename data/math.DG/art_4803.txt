Gradient estimates and entropy formulae of porous medium and fast
  diffusion equations for the Witten Laplacian
We consider gradient estimates to positive solutions of porous medium
equations and fast diffusion equations: $$u_t=\Delta_\phi(u^p)$$ associated
with the Witten Laplacian on Riemannian manifolds. Under the assumption that
the $m$-dimensional Bakry-Emery Ricci curvature is bounded from below, we
obtain gradient estimates which generalize the results in [20] and [13].
Moreover, inspired by X. -D. Li's work in [19] we also study the entropy
formulae introduced in [20] for porous medium equations and fast diffusion
equations associated with the Witten Laplacian. We prove monotonicity theorems
for such entropy formulae on compact Riemannian manifolds with non-negative
$m$-dimensional Bakry-Emery Ricci curvature
