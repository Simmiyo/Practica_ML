Homogeneous Hypercomplex Structures and the Joyce's Construction
We prove that any invariant hypercomplex structure on a homogeneous space $M
= G/L$ where $G$ is a compact Lie group is obtained via the Joyce's
construction, provided that there exists a hyper-Hermitian naturally reductive
invariant metric on $M$.
