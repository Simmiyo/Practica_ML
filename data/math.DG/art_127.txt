The Yamabe invariant of simply connected manifolds
We prove that the Yamabe invariant of any simply connected smooth manifold of
dimension n greater than four is non-negative. Equivalently that the infimum of
the L^{n/2} norm of the scalar curvature, over the space of all Riemannian
metrics on the manifold, is zero.
