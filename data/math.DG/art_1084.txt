Infinite connected sums, K-area and positive scalar curvature
Recently, Whyte used the index theory of Dirac operators and the
Block-Weiberger uniformly finite homology to show that certain infinite
connected sums do not carry a metric with nonnegative scalar curvature in their
bounded geometry class. His proof uses a generalization of the $\hat{A}$-class
to obstruct such metrics. In this note we prove a variant of Whyte's result
where infinite $K$-area in the sense of Gromov is used to obstruct metrics with
positive scalar curvature.
