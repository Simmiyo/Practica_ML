Biharmonic curves on \textit{LP}-Sasakian manifolds
In this paper we give necessary and sufficient conditions for spacelike and
timelike curves in a conformally flat, quasi conformally flat and conformally
symmetric 4-dimensional \textit{LP}-Sasakian manifold to be proper biharmonic.
Also, we investigate proper biharmonic curves in the Lorentzian sphere
$S^{4}_{1}$.
