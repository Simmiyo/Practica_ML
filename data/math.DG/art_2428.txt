The Hijazi inequality on conformally parabolic manifolds
We prove the Hijazi inequality, an estimate for Dirac eigenvalues, for
complete manifolds of finite volume. Under some additional assumptions on the
dimension and the scalar curvature, this inequality is also valid for elements
of the essential spectrum. This allows to prove the conformal version of the
Hijazi inequality on conformally parabolic manifolds if the spin analog to the
Yamabe invariant is positive.
