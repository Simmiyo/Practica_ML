Maximal surfaces with singularities in Minkowski space
We shall investigate maximal surfaces in Minkowski 3-space with
singularities. Although the plane is the only complete maximal surface without
singular points, there are many other complete maximal surfaces with
singularities and we show that they satisfy an Osserman-type inequality.
