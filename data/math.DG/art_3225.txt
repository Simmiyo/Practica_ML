Coherent tangent bundles and Gauss-Bonnet formulas for wave fronts
We give a definition of `coherent tangent bundles', which is an intrinsic
formulation of wave fronts. In our application of coherent tangent bundles for
wave fronts, the first fundamental forms and the third fundamental forms are
considered as induced metrics of certain homomorphisms between vector bundles.
They satisfy the completely same conditions, and so can reverse roles with each
other. For a given wave front of a 2-manifold, there are two Gauss-Bonnet
formulas. By exchanging the roles of the fundamental forms, we get two new
additional Gauss-Bonnet formulas for the third fundamental form. Surprisingly,
these are different from those for the first fundamental form, and using these
four formulas, we get several new results on the topology and geometry of wave
fronts.
