Lie Algebroids and Classification Problems in Geometry
We show how one can associate to a given class of finite type G-structures a
classifying Lie algebroid. The corresponding Lie groupoid gives models for the
different geometries that one can find in the class, and encodes also the
different types of symmetry groups.
