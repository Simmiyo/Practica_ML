Determination of the position vectors of general helices from intrinsic
  equations in $\e^3$
In this paper, we prove that the position vector of every space curve
satisfies a vector differential equation of fourth order. Also, we determine
the parametric representation of the position vector
$\psi=\Big(\psi_1,\psi_2,\psi_3\Big)$ of general helices from the intrinsic
equations $\kappa=\kappa(s)$ and $\tau=\tau(s)$ where $\kappa$ and $\tau$ are
the curvature and torsion of the space curve $\psi$, respectively. Our result
extends some knwown results. Moreover, we give four examples to illustrate how
to find the position vector from the intrinsic equations of general helices.
