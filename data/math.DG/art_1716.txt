A new formula for the energy functionals E_k and its applications
We give a new formula for the energy functionals E_k defined by Chen-Tian,
and discuss the relations between these functionals. We also apply our formula
to give a new proof of the fact that the holomorphic invariants corresponding
to the E_k functionals are equal to the Futaki invariant.
