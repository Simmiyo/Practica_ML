On the geometry of the orbits of Killing vector fields
Let $D$ be a set of smooth vector fields on the smooth manifold $M$.It is
known that orbits of $D$ are submanifolds of M. Partition $F$ of M into orbits
of $D$ is a singular foliation. In this paper we are studying geometry of
foliation which is generated by orbits of a family of Killing vector fields.In
the case $M=R^3$ it is obtained full geometrical classification of $F$.
Throughout this paper the word "smooth" refers to a class $C^\infty$.
