Global rigidity in CR geometry: the Schoen-Webster theorem
Schoen-Webster theorem asserts a pseudoconvex CR manifold whose automorphism
group acts non properly is either the standard sphere or the Heisenberg space.
The purpose of this paper is to survey successive works around this result and
then provide a short geometric proof in the compact case.
