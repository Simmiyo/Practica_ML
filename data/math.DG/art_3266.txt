Hypersurfaces in the noncompact Grassmann manifold SU_{2,m}/S(U_2U_m)
The Riemannian symmetric space SU_{2,m}/S(U_2U_m) is both Hermitian symmetric
and quaternionic Kahler symmetric. Let M be a hypersurface in
SU_{2,m}/S(U_2U_m) and denote by TM its tangent bundle. The complex structure
of SU_{2,m}/S(U_2U_m) determines a maximal complex subbundle C of TM, and the
quaternionic structure of SU_{2,m}/S(U_2U_m) determines a maximal quaternionic
subbundle Q of TM. In this article we investigate hypersurfaces in
SU_{2,m}/S(U_2U_m) for which C and Q are closely related to the shape of M.
