Eigenvalue estimates for the Dirac-Schrödinger operators
We give new estimates for the eigenvalues of the hypersurface Dirac operator
in terms of the intrinsic energy-momentum tensor, the mean curvature and the
scalar curvature. We also discuss their limiting cases as well as the limiting
cases of the estimates obtained by X. Zhang and O. Hijazi in [13] and [10]. We
compare these limiting cases with those corresponding to the Friedrich and
Hijazi inequalities. We conclude by comparing these results to intrinsic
estimates for the Dirac-Schr\"odinger operator D_f = D - f/2.
