Invariant valuations on quaternionic vector spaces
The spaces of Sp(n)-, Sp(n)U(1)- and Sp(n)Sp(1)- invariant, translation
invariant, continuous convex valuations on the quaternionic vector space H^n
are studied. Combinatorial dimension formulas involving Young diagrams and
Schur polynomials are proved.
