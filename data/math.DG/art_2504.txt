The index of a vector field on an orbifold with boundary
A Poincar\'{e}-Hopf theorem in the spirit of Pugh is proven for compact
orbifolds with boundary. The theorem relates the index sum of a smooth vector
field in generic contact with the boundary orbifold to the Euler-Satake
characteristic of the orbifold and a boundary term. The boundary term is
expressed as a sum of Euler characteristics of tangency and exit-region
orbifolds. As a corollary, we express the index sum of the vector field induced
on the inertia orbifold to the Euler characteristics of the associated
underlying topological spaces.
