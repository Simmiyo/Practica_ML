Degenerations of Riemannian manifolds
This is an expositiry article on collapsing theory in Riemannian geometry
written for the Modern Encyclopedia of Mathematical Physics (MEMPhys). We focus
on describing the geometric and topological structure of
collapsed/non-collapsed regions in Riemannian manifold under various curvature
assumptions. Numerous applications of collapsing theory to Riemannian geometry
are NOT discussed in this survey.
