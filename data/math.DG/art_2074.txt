Canonical connections on paracontact manifolds
The canonical paracontact connection is defined and it is shown that its
torsion is the obstruction the paracontact manifold to be paraSasakian. A
$\mathcal{D}$-homothetic transformation is determined as a special gauge
transformation. The $\eta$-Einstein manifold are defined, it is prove that
their scalar curvature is a constant and it is shown that in the paraSasakian
case these spaces can be obtained from Einstein paraSasakian manifolds with a
$\mathcal{D}$-homothetic transformations. It is shown that an almost
paracontact structure admits a connection with totally skew-symmetric torsion
if and only if the Nijenhuis tensor of the paracontact structure is
skew-symmetric and the defining vector field is Killing.
