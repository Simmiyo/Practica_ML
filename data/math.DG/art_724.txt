On skew loops, skew branes and quadratic hypersurfaces
A skew brane is an immersed codimension 2 submanifold in affine space, free
from pairs of parallel tangent spaces. Using Morse theory, we prove that a skew
brane cannot lie on a quadratic hypersurface. We also prove that there are no
skew loops on embedded ruled developable discs in 3-space. The paper extends
recent work by M. Ghomi and B. Solomon.
