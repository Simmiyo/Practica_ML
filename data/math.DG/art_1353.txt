Higher order Hessian structures on manifolds
In this paper we define $n$th order Hessian structures on manifolds and study
them. In particular, when $n = 3$, we make a detailed study and establish a
one-to-one correspondence between {\it third-order Hessian structures} and a
{\it certain class of connections} on the second-order tangent bundle of a
manifold. Further, we show that a connection on the tangent bundle of a
manifold induces a connection on the second-order tangent bundle. Also we
define second-order geodesics of special second-order connection which gives a
geometric characterization of symmetric third-order Hessian structures.
