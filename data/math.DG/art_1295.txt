Nilpotency, almost nonnegative curvature and the gradient flow
We show that almost nonnegatively curved m-dimensional manifolds are, up to
finite cover, nilpotent spaces in the sense of homotopy theory and have
C(m)-nilpotent fundamental groups. We also show that up to a finite cover
almost nonnegatively curved manifolds are fiber bundles with simply connected
fibers over nilmanifolds.
