A Residue Formula for SU(2)-valued Moment Maps
Jeffrey and Kirwan suggested expressions for intersection pairings on the
reduced space of a Hamiltonian G-space in terms of multiple residues. In this
paper we prove a residue formula for symplectic volumes of reduced spaces of a
quasi-Hamiltonian SU(2)-space. The definition of quasi-Hamiltonian G-spaces was
recently introduced by Alekseev, Malkin and Meinrenken.
