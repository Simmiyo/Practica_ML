Cartan Connections and Lie Algebroids
This paper is a study of the relationship between two constructions
associated with Cartan geometries, both of which involve Lie algebroids: the
Cartan algebroid, due to [Blaom A.D., Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 358 (2006),
3651-3671], and tractor calculus [Cap A., Gover A.R., Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.
354 (2001), 1511-1548].
