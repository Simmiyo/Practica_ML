Orthogonality of Homogeneous geodesics on the tangent bundle
Let $\xi=(G\times_{K} \mathcal{G} / \mathcal{K}, \rho_{\xi}, \emph{G} /
\emph{K},\mathcal{G} / \mathcal{K})$ be the associated bundle and
$\tau_{G/K}=(T_{G/K},\pi_{G/K},G/K, \textrm{R}^{m})$ be the tangent bundle of
special examples of odd dimension solvable Lie groups equipped with left
invariant Riemannian metric. In this paper we prove some conditions about the
existence of homogeneous geodesic on the base space of $\tau_{G/K}$ and
homogeneous (geodesic) vectors on the fiber space of $\xi$ .
