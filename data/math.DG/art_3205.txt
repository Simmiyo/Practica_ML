Locally homogeneous structures on Hopf surfaces
We study holomorphic locally homogeneous geometric structures modelled on
line bundles over the projective line. We classify these structures on primary
Hopf surfaces. We write out the developing map and holonomy morphism of each of
these structures explicitly on each primary Hopf surface.
