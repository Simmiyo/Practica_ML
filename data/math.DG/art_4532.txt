Integrating P- super vectorfields and the super geodesic flow
Aim of this article is to introduce the notion of integral and geodesic flows
on P-supermanifolds as certain partial actions of R . First I introduce the
concept of parametrization over a `small' super algebra P, which leads to the
notion of P-objects and is superized local deformation theory. It is shown how
parametrization makes the theory much easier. A version of Palais' theorem for
P-supermanifolds is obtained stating that every infinitesimal P-action of a
simply connected P-super Lie group G on a P-supermanifold can be integrated to
a whole action of G . Furthermore the faithful linearization of affine
P-supermorphisms is proven. Finally I show that Newton's, Lagrange's and
Hamilton's approach to mechanics can be formulated also for P- Riemannian
supermanifolds and are infact equivalent.
