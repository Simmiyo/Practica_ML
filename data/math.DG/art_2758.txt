A proof of Lens Rigidity in the category of Analytic Metrics
Consider a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary. Assume all maximally
extended geodesics intersect the boundary at both ends. Then to each maximal
geodesic segment one can form a triple consisting of the initial and final
vectors of the segment and the length of the segment. The collection of all
such triples comprises the lens data. In this paper, it is shown that in the
category of analytic Riemannian manifolds, the lens data uniquely determine the
metric up to isometry. There are no convexity assumptions on the boundary, and
conjugate points are allowed, but with some restriction.
