A relation between the Ricci tensor and the spectrum of the Dirac
  operator
Using Weitzenb\"ock techniques on any compact Riemannian spin manifold we
derive a general inequality depending on a real parameter and joining the
spectrum of the Dirac operator with terms depending on the Ricci tensor and its
first covariant derivatives. The discussion of this inequality yields vanishing
theorems for the kernel of the Dirac operator $D$ and new lower bounds for the
spectrum of $D^2$ if the Ricci tensor satisfies certain conditions.
