Some Applications of the Isoperimetric Inequality for Integral Varifolds
In this work the Isoperimetric Inequality for integral varifolds is used to
obtain sharp estimates for the size of the set where the density quotient is
small and to generalise Calder\'on's and Zygmund's theory of first order
differentiability for functions in Lebesgue spaces from Lebesgue measure to
integral varifolds.
