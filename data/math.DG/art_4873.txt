Canonical smoothing of compact Alexandrov surfaces via Ricci flow
In this paper, we show existence and uniqueness of Ricci flow whose initial
condition is a compact Alexandrov surface with curvature bounded from below.
This requires a weakening of the notion of initial condition which is able to
deal with a priori non-Riemannian metric spaces. As a by-product, we obtain
that the Ricci flow of a surface depends smoothly on Gromov-Hausdorff
perturbations of the initial condition.
