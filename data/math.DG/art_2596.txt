Parallel calibrations and minimal submanifolds
Given a parallel calibration $\phi \in \Omega^p(M)$ on a Riemannian manifold
$M$, I prove that the $\phi$--critical submanifolds with nonzero critical value
are minimal submanifolds. I also show that the $\phi$--critical submanifolds
are precisely the integral manifolds of a $\mathscr{C}^\infty(M)$--linear
subspace $\sP \subset \Omega^p(M)$. In particular, the calibrated submanifolds
are necessarily integral submanifolds of the system. (Examples of parallel
calibrations include the special Lagrangian calibration on Calabi-Yau
manifolds, (co)associative calibrations on $G_2$--manifolds, and the Cayley
calibration on $\tSpin(7)$--manifolds.)
