Limiting Behavior of a Class of Hermitian-Yang-Mills Metrics
Motivated by mirror symmetry, we begin to study the limiting behavior of
Hermitian-Yang-Mills metrics on a class of rank two slope-stable vector bundles
over the product of two elliptic curves with a family of product metrics, which
are flat and have areas $\epsilon$ and $\epsilon^{-1}$ on two factors
respectively. The method is to construct a family of Hermitian metrics and then
compare them with the normalized Hermitian-Yang-Mills metrics. We find that the
metrics are close in $C^k$ to arbitrary order in $\epsilon$.
