On a question of Vaisman concerning complex surfaces
The last years have seen striking improvements on Vaisman's question about
existence of locally conformally K\"ahler (lcK) metrics on compact complex
surfaces. The aim of this paper is two-fold. We review results of different
authors which, for all known examples of compact complex surfaces, give a
complete answer to Vaisman's question. We also point out a relation between lcK
surfaces and generalized K\"ahler geometry in four-dimension and prove a new
result concerning generalized K\"ahler structures on Hyperbolic Inoue surfaces.
We conclude with a simple observation on a question of Brunella.
