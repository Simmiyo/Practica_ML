Compactness properties of the space of genus-g helicoids
In \cite{CM5}, Colding and Minicozzi describe a type of compactness property
possessed by sequences of embedded minimal surfaces in $\Real^3$ with finite
genus and with boundaries going to $\infty$. They show that any such sequence
either contains a sub-sequence with uniformly bounded curvature or the
sub-sequence has certain prescribed singular behavior. In this paper, we
sharpen their description of the singular behavior when the surfaces have
connected boundary. Using this, we deduce certain additional compactness
properties of the space of genus-$g$ helicoids.
