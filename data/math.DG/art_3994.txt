On Double Vector Bundles
In this paper, we construct a category of short exact sequences of vector
bundles and prove that it is equivalent to the category of double vector
bundles. Moreover, operations on double vector bundles can be transferred to
operations on the corresponding short exact sequences. In particular, we study
the duality theory of double vector bundles in term of the corresponding short
exact sequences. Examples including the jet bundle and the Atiyah algebroid are
discussed.
