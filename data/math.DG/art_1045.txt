Limits of functions and elliptic operators
We show that a subspace $S$ of the space of real analytical functions on a
manifold that satisfies certain regularity properties is contained in the set
of solutions of a linear elliptic differential equation. The regularity
properties are that $S$ is closed in $L^2(M)$ and that if a sequence of
functions $f_n$ in $S$ converges in $L^2(M)$, then so do the partial
derivatives of the functions $f_n$.
