On two-dimensional immersions of prescribed mean curvature in R^n
We consider two-dimensional immersions of disc-type in R^n. We focus well
known classical concepts and study the nonlinear elliptic systems of such
mappings. Using an Osserman-type condition we give a priori-estimates of the
principle curvatures for certain graphs in R^4 with prescribed mean curvature.
