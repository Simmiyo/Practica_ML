Explicit formulas for biharmonic submanifolds in Sasakian space forms
We classify the biharmonic Legendre curves in a Sasakian space form, and
obtain their explicit parametric equations in the $(2n+1)$-dimensional unit
sphere endowed with the canonical and deformed Sasakian structures defined by
Tanno. Then, composing with the flow of the Reeb vector field, we transform a
biharmonic integral submanifold into a biharmonic anti-invariant submanifold.
Using this method we obtain new examples of biharmonic submanifolds in spheres
and, in particular, in $\mathbb{S}^{7}$.
