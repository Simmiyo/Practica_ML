The K-group of R-constructible Sheaves
Let Z be a smooth projective manifold. In these notes I will prove that the
K-group of R-constructible sheaves is isomorphic to the free abelian group with
one generator for each open semialgebraic subset $U$ (which I will denote by
the same letter) modulo the Mayer-Vietoris relations: U + V - U^V - UvV = 0.
  I will prove it by showing that both groups in question are isomorphic to the
group of all integer-valued semialgebraic functions on Z.
