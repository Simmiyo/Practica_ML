Examples of a complex hyperpolar actions without singular orbit
The notion of a complex hyperpolar action on a symmetric space of non-compact
type has recently been introduced as counterpart of a hyperpolar action on a
symmetric space of compact type. In this paper, we construct examples of a
complex hyperpolar action without singular orbit and investigate the geometry
of the orbits of the examples.
