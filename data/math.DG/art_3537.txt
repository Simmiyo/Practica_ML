Complex surfaces and interpolation on pseudo-holomorphic cylinders
Gromov has shown how to construct holomorphic maps of the plane to a complex
manifold with prescribed values on a lattice. In the present paper, a similar
interpolation theorem for pseudo-holomorphic maps from the cylinder S to an
almost-complex manifold (M,J) is proved. Properties of the space of
pseudo-holomorphic maps from S to (M,J) are derived, in particular a lower
bound for the size of this space (in terms of mean dimension). When M is a
moduli space of curves, this gives a construction of non-compact complex
surfaces. The methods involve an infinite number of surgeries. On the way, a
refinement of the gluing process for two pseudo-holomorphic curves is obtained,
establishing the geometric behavior of two glued pseudo-holomorphic curves.
