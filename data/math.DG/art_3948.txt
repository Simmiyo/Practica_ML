Complex connections with trivial holonomy
Given an almost complex manifold (M, J), we study complex connections with
trivial holonomy and such that the corresponding torsion is either of type
(2,0) or of type (1,1) with respect to J. Such connections arise naturally when
considering Lie groups, and quotients by discrete subgroups, equipped with
bi-invariant and abelian complex structures.
