Kaehler reduction of metrics with holonomy G_2
A torsion-free G_2 structure admitting an infinitesimal isometry is shown to
give rise to a 4-manifold equipped with a complex symplectic structure and a
1-parameter family of functions and 2-forms linked by second order equations.
Reversing the process in various special cases leads to the construction of
explicit metrics with holonomy equal to G_2.
