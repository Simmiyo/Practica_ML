Minimal Lagrangian surfaces in the tangent bundle of a Riemannian
  surface
Given an oriented Riemannian surface $(\Sigma, g)$, its tangent bundle
$T\Sigma$ enjoys a natural pseudo-K\"{a}hler structure, that is the combination
of a complex structure $\J$, a pseudo-metric $\G$ with neutral signature and a
symplectic structure $\Om$. We give a local classification of those surfaces of
$T\Sigma$ which are both Lagrangian with respect to $\Om$ and minimal with
respect to $\G$. We first show that if $g$ is non-flat, the only such surfaces
are affine normal bundles over geodesics. In the flat case there is, in
contrast, a large set of Lagrangian minimal surfaces, which is described
explicitly. As an application, we show that motions of surfaces in $\R^3$ or
$\R^3_1$ induce Hamiltonian motions of their normal congruences, which are
Lagrangian surfaces in $T\S^2$ or $T \H^2$ respectively. We relate the area of
the congruence to a second-order functional $\mathcal{F}=\int \sqrt{H^2-K} dA$
on the original surface.
