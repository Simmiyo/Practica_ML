Minimal submanifolds of Kaehler-Einstein manifolds with equal Kaehler
  angles
We consider $F: M \to N$ a minimal oriented compact real 2n-submanifold M,
immersed into a Kaehler-Einstein manifold N of complex dimension 2n, and scalar
curvature R. We assume that $n \geq 2$ and F has equal Kaehler angles. Our main
result is to prove that, if n = 2 and $R \neq 0$, then F is either a complex
submanifold or a Lagrangian submanifold. We also prove that, if $n \geq 3$ and
F has no complex points, then: (A) If R < 0, then F is Lagrangian; (B) If R =
0, the Kaehler angle must be constant. We also study pluriminimal submanifolds
with equal Kaehler angles, and prove that, if they are not complex
submanifolds, N must be Ricci-flat and there is a natural parallel homothetic
isomorphism between TM and the normal bundle.
