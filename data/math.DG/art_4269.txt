On the curvature of G-manifolds with finitely many non-principal orbits
We investigate the curvature of invariant metrics on G-manifolds with
finitely many non-principal orbits. We prove existence results for metrics of
positive Ricci curvature and non-negative sectional curvature, and discuss some
families of examples to which these existence results apply.
