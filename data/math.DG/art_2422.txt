On three-parametric Lie groups as quasi-Kaehler manifolds with Killing
  Norden metric
A 3-parametric family of 6-dimensional quasi-Kaehler manifolds with Norden
metric is constructed on a Lie group. This family is characterized
geometrically. The condition for such a 6-manifold to be isotropic Kaehler is
given.
