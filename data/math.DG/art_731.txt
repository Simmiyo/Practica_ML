Metrics of positive Ricci curvature on quotient spaces
We show that any closed biquotient with finite fundamental group admits
metrics of positive Ricci curvature. Also, let M be a closed manifold on which
a compact Lie group G acts with cohomogeneity one, and let L be a closed
subgroup of G which acts freely on M. We show that the quotient N := M/L
carries metrics of nonnegative Ricci and almost nonnegative sectional
curvature. Moreover, if N has finite fundamental group, then N admits also
metrics of positive Ricci curvature. Particular examples include infinite
families of simply connected manifolds with the rational cohomology rings and
integral homology of complex and quaternionic projective spaces.
