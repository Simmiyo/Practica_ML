Sasaki--Weyl connections on CR manifolds
We introduce and study the notion of Sasaki--Weyl manifold, which is a
natural generalization of the notion of Sasaki manifold. We construct a
reduction of Sasaki--Weyl manifolds and we show that it commutes with several
reductions already existing in the literature.
