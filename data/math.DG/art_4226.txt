Twistor Theory for co-CR quaternionic manifolds and related structures
In a general and non metrical framework, we introduce the class of co-CR
quaternionic manifolds, which contains the class of quaternionic manifolds,
whilst in dimension three it particularizes to give the Einstein-Weyl spaces.
We show that these manifolds have a rich natural Twistor Theory and, along the
way, we obtain a heaven space construction for quaternionic-Kaehler manifolds.
