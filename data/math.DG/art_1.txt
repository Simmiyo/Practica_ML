A cohomology for vector valued differential forms
A rather simple natural outer derivation of the graded Lie algebra of all
vector valued differential forms with the Fr\"olicher-Nijenhuis bracket turns
out to be a differential and gives rise to a cohomology of the manifold, which
is functorial under local diffeomorphisms. This cohomology is determined as the
direct product of the de Rham cohomology space and the graded Lie algebra of
"traceless" vector valued differential forms, equipped with a new natural
differential concomitant as graded Lie bracket. We find two graded Lie algebra
structures on the space of differential forms. Some consequences and related
results are also discussed.
