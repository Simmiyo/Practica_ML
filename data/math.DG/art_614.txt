A note on hamiltonian Lie group actions and Massey products
In this note we show that the property of having only vanishing triple Massey
products in the equivariant cohomology is inherited by the set of fixed points
of hamiltonian circle actions on closed symplectic manifolds. This result can
be considered in a more general context of characterizing homotopic properties
of Lie group actions. In particular, it can be viewed as a partial answer to
the Allday-Puppe question about finding conditions ensuring the "formality" of
G-actions.
