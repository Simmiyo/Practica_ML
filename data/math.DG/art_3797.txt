On Deformable Minimal Hypersurfaces in Space Forms
The aim of this paper is to complete the local classification of minimal
hypersurfaces with vanishing Gauss-Kronecker curvature in a 4-dimensional space
form. Moreover, we give a classification of complete minimal hypersurfaces with
vanishing Gauss-Kronecker curvature and scalar curvature bounded from below.
