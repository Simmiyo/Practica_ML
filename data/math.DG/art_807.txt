3-dimensional Cauchy-Riemann structures and 2nd order ordinary
  differential equations
The equivalence problem for second order ODEs given modulo point
transformations is solved in full analogy with the equivalence problem of
nondegenerate 3-dimensional CR structures. This approach enables an analog of
the Feffereman metrics to be defined. The conformal class of these (split
signature) metrics is well defined by each point equivalence class of second
order ODEs. Its conformal curvature is interpreted in terms of the basic point
invariants of the corresponding class of ODEs.
