The Singly Periodic Genus-One Helicoid
We prove the existence of a complete, embedded, singly periodic minimal
surface, whose quotient by vertical translations has genus one and two ends.
The existence of this surface was announced in our paper in {\it Bulletin of
the AMS}, 29(1):77--84, 1993. Its ends in the quotient are asymptotic to one
full turn of the helicoid, and, like the helicoid, it contains a vertical line.
Modulo vertical translations, it has two parallel horizontal lines crossing the
vertical axis. The nontrivial symmetries of the surface, modulo vertical
translations, consist of: $180^\circ$ rotation about the vertical line;
$180^\circ$ rotation about the horizontal lines (the same symmetry); and their
composition.
