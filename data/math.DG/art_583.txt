Deformations of calibrations, {Calabi-Yau, HyperKähler, $G_2$ and
  Spin(7) structures}
We shall develop a new deformation theory of geometric structures in terms of
closed differential forms. This theory is a generalization of Kodaira -Spencer
theory and further we obtain a criterion of unobstructed deformations. We apply
this theory to certain geometric structures: Calabi-Yau, HyperK\"ahler, $\G$
and $\Spin$ structures and show that these deformation spaces are smooth in a
systematic way.
