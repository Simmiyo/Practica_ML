Discrete Gliding Along Principal Curves
We consider $n$-dimensional discrete motions such that any two neighbouring
positions correspond in a pure rotation ("rotating motions"). In the Study
quadric model of Euclidean displacements these motions correspond to
quadrilateral nets with edges contained in the Study quadric ("rotation nets").
The main focus of our investigation lies on the relation between rotation nets
and discrete principal contact element nets. We show that every principal
contact element net occurs in infinitely many ways as trajectory of a discrete
rotating motion (a discrete gliding motion on the underlying surface).
Moreover, we construct discrete rotating motions with two non-parallel
principal contact element net trajectories. Rotation nets with this property
can be consistently extended to higher dimensions.
