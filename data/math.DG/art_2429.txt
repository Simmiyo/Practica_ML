A characterization of quaternionic projective space by the
  conformal-Killing equation
We prove that a compact quaternionic-K\"{a}hler manifold of dimension $4n\geq
8$ admitting a conformal-Killing 2-form which is not Killing, is isomorphic to
the quaternionic projective space, with its standard quaternionic-K\"{a}hler
structure.
