The detailed proof of theorem which characterizes a slant helix
In this paper, firstly the axis of a slant helix is found with a method.
Secondly, the theorem which characterizes a unit speed curve to be a slant
helix is proved in detail. The importance of this theorem is stemed from that
it has led to many papers regarding slant helices in the differential geometry
literature.
