Autodual Einstein versus Kahler-Einstein
Any strictly pseudoconvex domain in C2 carries a complete Kahler-Einstein
metric, the Cheng-Yau metric, with ``conformal infinity'' the CR structure of
the boundary. It is well known that not all CR structures on the 3-sphere arise
in this way. In this paper, we study CR structures on the 3-sphere satisfying a
different filling condition: boundaries at infinity of (complete) selfdual
Einstein metrics. We prove that (modulo contactomorphisms) they form an
infinite dimensional manifold, transverse to the space of CR structures which
are boundaries of complex domains (and therefore of Kahler-Einstein metrics).
