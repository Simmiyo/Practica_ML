Cappell-Miller analytic torsion for manifolds with boundary
Inspired by the work of Boris Vertman on refined analytic torsion for
manifolds with boundary, in this paper we extend the construction of the
Cappell-Miller analytic torsion to manifolds with boundary. We also compare it
with the refined analytic torsion on manifolds with boundary. As a byproduct of
the gluing formula for refined analytic torsion and the comparison theorem for
the Cappell-Miller analytic torsion and the refined analytic torsion, we
establish the gluing formula for the Cappell-Miller analytic torsion in the
case that the Hermitian metric is flat.
