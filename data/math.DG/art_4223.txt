Affine hypersurfaces admitting a pointwise SO(n-1) symmetry
In this article we obtain a classification of strictly locally convex affine
hypersurfaces in A^{n+1} for which the geometrical structure is pointwise
invariant under the group SO(n-1) represented by rotations around a fixed axis
in the tangent space.
