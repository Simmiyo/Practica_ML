A Gap Theorem for Self-shrinkers of the Mean Curvature Flow in Arbitrary
  Codimension
In this paper, we prove a classification theorem for self-shrinkers of the
mean curvature flow with $|A|^2\le 1$ in arbitrary codimension. In particular,
this implies a gap theorem for self-shrinkers in arbitrary codimension.
