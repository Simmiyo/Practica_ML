Anisotropic isoparametric hypersurfaces in Euclidean spaces
In this note, we give a classification of complete anisotropic isoparametric
hypersurfaces, i.e., hypersurfaces with constant anisotropic principal
curvatures, in Euclidean spaces, which is in analogue with the classical case
for isoparametric hypersurfaces in Euclidean spaces. On the other hand, by an
example of local anisotropic isoparametric surface constructed by B. Palmer, we
find that anisotropic isoparametric hypersurfaces have both local and global
aspects as in the theory of proper Dupin hypersurfaces.
