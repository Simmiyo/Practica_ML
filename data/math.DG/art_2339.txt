Finsleroid-regular space. Landsberg-to-Berwald implication
By performing required evaluations, we show that in the Finsleroid-regular
space the Landsberg-space condition just degenerates to the Berwald-space
condition (at any dimension number $N\ge2$). Simple and clear expository
representations are obtained. Due comparisons with the Finsleroid-Finsler space
are indicated.
  Keywords: Finsler metrics, spray coefficients, curvature tensors.
