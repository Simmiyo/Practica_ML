A moduli curve for compact conformally-Einstein Kähler manifolds
We classify quadruples $(M,g,m,\tau)$ in which $(M,g)$ is a compact K\"ahler
manifold of complex dimension $m>2$ with a nonconstant function $\tau$ on $M$
such that the conformally related metric $g/\tau^2$, defined wherever $\tau\ne
0$, is Einstein. It turns out that $M$ then is the total space of a holomorphic
$CP^1$ bundle over a compact K\"ahler-Einstein manifold $(N,h)$. The quadruples
in question constitute four disjoint families: one, well-known, with K\"ahler
metrics $g$ that are locally reducible; a second, discovered by B\'erard
Bergery (1982), and having $\tau\ne 0$ everywhere; a third one, related to the
second by a form of analytic continuation, and analogous to some known K\"ahler
surface metrics; and a fourth family, present only in odd complex dimensions
$m\ge 9$. Our classification uses a {\it moduli curve}, which is a subset
$\mathcal{C}$, depending on $m$, of an algebraic curve in $R^2$. A point
$(u,v)$ in $\mathcal{C}$ is naturally associated with any $(M,g,m,\tau)$ having
all of the above properties except for compactness of $M$, replaced by a weaker
requirement of ``vertical'' compactness. One may in turn reconstruct $M,g$ and
$\tau$ from this $(u,v)$ coupled with some other data, among them a
K\"ahler-Einstein base $(N,h)$ for the $CP^1$ bundle $M$. The points $(u,v)$
arising in this way from $(M,g,m,\tau)$ with compact $M$ form a countably
infinite subset of $\mathcal{C}$.
