Harmonic morphisms from the Grassmannians and their non-compact duals
In this paper we give a unified framework for the construction of complex
valued harmonic morphisms from the real, complex and quaternionic Grassmannians
and their non-compact duals. This gives a positive answer to the corresponding
open existence problem in the real and quaternionic cases.
