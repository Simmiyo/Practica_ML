Integration of Holomorphic Lie Algebroids
We prove that a holomorphic Lie algebroid is integrable if, and only if, its
underlying real Lie algebroid is integrable. Thus the integrability criteria of
Crainic-Fernandes do also apply in the holomorphic context without any
modification. As a consequence we give another proof of the following theorem:
a holomorphic Poisson manifold is integrable if, and only if, its real (or
imaginary) part is integrable as a real Poisson manifold.
