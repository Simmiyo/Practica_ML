Existence Theorems for Timelike Ruled Surfaces in Minkowski 3-Space
In this study we investigate the existence theorems for timelike ruled
surfaces in Minkowski 3-space. We obtained a general system and give the
existence theorems for timelike ruled surface according to Gaussian curvature,
distribution parameter and strictional distance. Moreover, we give some special
cases such as the directirx of the surface is a geodesic, an asymptotic line, a
line of curvature or a general helix.
