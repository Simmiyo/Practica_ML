Irreducible holonomy algebras of odd Riemannian supermanifolds
Possible irreducible holonomy algebras $\g\subset\sp(2m,\Real)$ of odd
Riemannian supermanifolds and irreducible subalgebras $\g\subset\gl(n,\Real)$
with non-trivial first skew-symmetric prolongations are classified. An approach
to the classification of some classes of the holonomy algebras of Riemannian
supermanifolds is discussed.
