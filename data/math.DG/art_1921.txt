A sharp estimate for the bottom of the spectrum of the Laplacian on
  Kähler manifolds
On a complete noncompact K\"{a}hler manifold we prove that the bottom of the
spectrum for the Laplacian is bounded from above by $m^2$ if the Ricci
curvature is bounded from below by $-2(m+1)$. Then we show that if this upper
bound is achieved then the manifold has at most two ends. These results improve
previous results on this subject proved by P. Li and J. Wang in \cite {L-W3}
and \cite{L-W} under assumptions on the bisectional curvature.
