Geodesic Equations on Diffeomorphism Groups
We bring together those systems of hydrodynamical type that can be written as
geodesic equations on diffeomorphism groups or on extensions of diffeomorphism
groups with right invariant $L^2$ or $H^1$ metrics. We present their formal
derivation starting from Euler's equation, the first order equation satisfied
by the right logarithmic derivative of a geodesic in Lie groups with right
invariant metrics.
