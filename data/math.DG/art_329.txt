Some Ricci Flat (pseudo-) Riemannian Geometries
We define a class of two dimensional surfaces conformally related to minimal
surfaces in flat three dimensional geometries. By the utility of the metrics of
such surfaces we give a construction of the metrics of $2 N$ dimensional Ricci
flat (pseudo-) Riemannian geometries.
