Symplectic Applicability of Lagrangian Surfaces
We develop an approach to affine symplectic invariant geometry of Lagrangian
surfaces by the method of moving frames. The fundamental invariants of elliptic
Lagrangian immersions in affine symplectic four-space are derived together with
their integrability equations. The invariant setup is applied to discuss the
question of symplectic applicability for elliptic Lagrangian immersions.
Explicit examples are considered.
