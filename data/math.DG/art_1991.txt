Manifolds admitting stable forms
In this note we give a direct method to classify all stable forms on $\R^n$
as well as to determine their automorphism groups. We show that in dimension
6,7,8 stable forms coincide with non-degnerate forms.
  We present necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for a manifold to
admit a stable form. We also discuss rich properties of the geometry of such
manifolds.
