On a normalization of a Grassmann manifold
On the Grassmann manifold G (m, n) of m-dimensional subspaces of an
n-dimensional projective space P^n, a certain supplementary construction called
the normalization is considered. By means of this normalization, one can
construct the structure of a Riemannian or semi-Riemannian manifold or an
affine connection on G(m, n).
