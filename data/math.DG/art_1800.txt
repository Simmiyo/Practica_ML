Minimal surfaces with genus zero
A very interesting problem in the classical theory of minimal surfaces
consists of the classification of such surfaces under some geometrical and
topological constraints. In this short paper, we give a brief summary of the
known classification results for properly embedded minimal surfaces with genus
zero in $\mathbb{R}^3$ or quotients of $\mathbb{R}^3$ by one or two independent
translations. This does not intend to be an exhaustive review of the tools or
proofs in the field, but a simple explanation of the currently known results.
