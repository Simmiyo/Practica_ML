Linear Connections on Normal Almost Contact Manifolds with Norden Metric
Families of linear connections are constructed on almost contact manifolds
with Norden metric. An analogous connection to the symmetric Yano connection is
obtained on a normal almost contact manifold with Norden metric and closed
structural 1-form. The curvature properties of this connection are studied on
two basic classes of normal almost contact manifolds with Norden metric.
