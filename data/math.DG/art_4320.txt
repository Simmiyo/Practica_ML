On Slant Helices and General Helices in Euclidean n-Space
In this paper, in Euclidean n -space, we investigate the relation between
slant helices and spherical helices. Moreover, in E n, we show that a slant
helix and the tangent indicatrix of the slant helix have the same axis (or
direction). Also, we give the important relations between slant helices,
spherical helices in E n and geodesic curves on a helix hypersurface in E n.
