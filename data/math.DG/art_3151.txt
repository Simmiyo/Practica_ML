On Eschenburg's Habilitation on Biquotients
These are notes of a talk I gave in a seminar at the University of
Pennsylvania summarizing results in the Habilitation by Jost Eschenburg on
"Freie isometrische Aktionen auf kompakten Lie-Gruppen mit positiv gekruemmten
Orbitraeumen". Due to the fact that it is published in a not easily accesible
journal (and is written in German) some of the results of his Habilitation are
not as well known as they deserve. Although the main results on new examples
with positive curvature were later published elsewhere, it contains a wealth of
further information about biquotients and a classification of equal rank
biquotients of simple Lie groups. I have no intention to publish these notes,
but post them as a service to the public. A scanned version of his Habilitation
(written in German) is available on my homepage.
