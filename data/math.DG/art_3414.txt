Rigidity of minimal submanifolds in hyperbolic space
We prove that if an $n$-dimensional complete minimal submanifold $M$ in
hyperbolic space has sufficiently small total scalar curvature then $M$ has
only one end. We also prove that for such $M$ there exist no nontrivial $L^2$
harmonic 1-forms on $M$.
