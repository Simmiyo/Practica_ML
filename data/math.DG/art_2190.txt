The asymptotic Tian-Yau-Zelditch expansion on Riemann surfaces with
  Constant Curvature
Let $M$ be a regular Riemann surface with a metric which has constant scalar
curvature $\rho$. We give the asymptotic expansion of the sum of the square
norm of the sections of the pluricanonical bundles $K_{M}^{m}$. That is,
\[\sum_{i=0}^{d_{m}-1}\|S_{i}(x_{0})\|_{h_{m}}^{2} \sim m(1+\frac{\rho}{2
m})+O(e^{-\frac{(\log m)^{2}}{8}}),\] where $\{S_{0},...,S_{d_{m}-1}\}$ is an
orthonormal basis for $H^{0}(M, K_{M}^{m})$ for sufficiently large $m$.
