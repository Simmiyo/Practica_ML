Kaehler Manifolds of Quasi-Constant Holomorphic Sectional Curvatures
The Kaehler manifolds of quasi-constant holomorphic sectional curvatures are
introduced as Kaehler manifolds with complex distribution of codimension two,
whose holomorphic sectional curvature only depends on the corresponding point
and the geometric angle, associated with the section. A curvature identity
characterizing such manifolds is found. The biconformal group of
transformations whose elements transform Kaehler metrics into Kaehler ones is
introduced and biconformal tensor invariants are obtained. This makes it
possible to classify the manifolds under consideration locally. The class of
locally biconformal flat Kaehler metrics is shown to be exactly the class of
Kaehler metrics whose potential function is only a function of the distance
from the origin in complex Euclidean space. Finally we show that any rotational
even dimensional hypersurface carries locally a natural Kaehler structure,
which is of quasi-constant holomorphic sectional curvatures.
