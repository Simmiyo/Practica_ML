Backward Ricci Flow on Locally Homogeneous Three-manifolds
In this paper, we study the backward Ricci flow on locally homogeneous
3-manifolds. We describe the long time behavior and show that, typically and
after a proper re-scaling, there is convergence to a sub-Riemannian geometry. A
similar behavior was observed by the authors in the case of the cross curvature
flow.
