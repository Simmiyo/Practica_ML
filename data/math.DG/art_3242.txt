Frobenius manifolds associated to Coxeter groups of type E_7 and E_8
Flat coordinates for Frobenius manifolds defined on the orbit space of a
Coxeter group W are specified through a certain system of generators of
W-invariant polynomials. In this note, starting from basic invariants proposed
by M.Mehta, we calculate flat coordinates for the exceptional groups of type
E_7 and E_8, leading to a derivation of the potentials for the associated
Frobenius structures.
