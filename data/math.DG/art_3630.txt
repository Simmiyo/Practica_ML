Negative Point Mass Singularities in General Relativity
First we review the definition of a negative point mass singularity. Then we
examine the gravitational lensing effects of these singularities in isolation
and with shear and convergence from continuous matter. We review the Inverse
Mean Curvature Flow and use this flow to prove some new results about the mass
of a singularity, the ADM mass of the manifold, and the capacity of the
singularity. We describe some particular examples of these singularities that
exhibit additional symmetries.
