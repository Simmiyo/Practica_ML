6-dimensional nearly Kaehler manifolds of cohomogeneity one
We consider 6-dimensional strict nearly Kaehler manifolds acted on by a
compact, cohomogeneity one automorphism group G. We classify the compact
manifolds of this class up to G-diffeomorphisms. We also prove that the
manifold has constant sectional curvature whenever the group G is simple.
