A characterization of holonomy invariant functions on tangent bundles
We show that the holonomy invariance of a function on the tangent bundle of a
manifold, together with very mild regularity conditions on the function, is
equivalent to the existence of local parallelisms compatible with the function
in a natural way. Thus, in particular, we obtain a characterization of
generalized Berwald manifolds. We also construct a simple example of a
generalized Berwald manifold which is not Berwald.
