Second Order Families of Special Lagrangian Submanifolds in C^4
This paper extends to dimension 4 the results in the article "Second Order
Families of Special Lagrangian 3-folds" by Robert Bryant. We consider the
problem of classifying the special Lagrangian 4-folds in C^4 whose fundamental
cubic at each point has a nontrivial stabilizer in SO(4). Points on special
Lagrangian 4-folds where the SO(4)-stabilizer is nontrivial are the analogs of
the umbilical points in the classical theory of surfaces. In proving existence
for the families of special Lagrangian 4-folds, we used the method of exterior
differential systems in Cartan-Kahler theory. This method is guaranteed to tell
us whether there are any families of special Lagrangian submanifolds with a
certain symmetry, but does not give us an explicit description of the
submanifolds. To derive an explicit description, we looked at foliations by
submanifolds and at other geometric particularities. In this manner, we settled
many of the cases and described the families of special Lagrangian submanifolds
in an explicit way.
