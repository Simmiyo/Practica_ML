Invariant forms, associated bundles and Calabi-Yau metrics
We develop a method, initially due to Salamon, to compute the space of
``invariant'' forms on an associated bundle X=P\times_G V, with a suitable
notion of invariance. We determine sufficient conditions for this space to be
d-closed. We apply our method to the construction of Calabi-Yau metrics on
TCP^1 and TCP^2.
