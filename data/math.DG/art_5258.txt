Three-orbifolds with positive scalar curvature
We prove the following result: Let $(\mathcal{O},g_0)$ be a complete,
connected 3-orbifold with uniformly positive scalar curvature, with bounded
geometry, and containing no bad 2-suborbifolds. Then there is a finite
collection $\mathcal{F}$ of spherical 3-orbifolds, such that $\mathcal{O}$ is
diffeomorphic to a (possibly infinite) orbifold connected sum of copies of
members in $\mathcal{F}$. This extends work of Perelman and
Bessi$\grave{e}$res-Besson-Maillot. The proof uses Ricci flow with surgery on
complete 3-orbifolds, and are along the lines of the author's previous work on
4-orbifolds with positive isotropic curvature.
