Conjugate loci of pseudoriemannian 2-step nilpotent Lie groups with
  nondegenerate center
We determine the complete conjugate locus along all geodesics parallel or
perpendicular to the center (Theorem 2.3). When the center is 1-dimensional we
obtain formulas in all cases (Theorem 2.5), and when a certain operator is also
diagonalizable these formulas become completely explicit (Corollary 2.7). These
yield some new information about the smoothness of the pseudoriemannian
conjugate locus. We also obtain the multiplicities of all conjugate points.
