A priori estimates and existence for a class of fully nonlinear elliptic
  equations in conformal geometry
In this paper we prove the interior gradient and second derivative estimates
for a class of fully nonlinear elliptic equations determined by symmetric
functions of eigenvalues of the Ricci or Schouten tensors. As an application we
prove the existence of solutions to the equations when the manifold is locally
conformally flat or the Ricci curvature is positive.
