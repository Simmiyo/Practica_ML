Special Kahler Metrics on Complex Line Bundles and the Geometry of
  $K3$-Surfaces
We construct metrics with the holonomy group SU(2) on the tangent bundles of
weighted complex projective lines and give a geometric description of the
moduli space of special Kahler metrics on a K3-surface in the neighborhood of
the flat orbifold $T^4/Z_3$.
