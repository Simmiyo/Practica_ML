The Group of Contact Diffeomorphisms for Compact Contact Manifolds
For a compact contact manifold it is shown that the anisotropic Folland-Stein
function spaces form an algebra. The notion of anisotropic regularity is
extended to define the space of Folland-Stein contact diffeomorphisms, which is
shown to be a topological group under composition and a smooth Hilbert
manifold. These results are used in a subsequent paper to analyze the action of
the group of contact diffeomorphisms on the space of CR structures on a
compact, three dimensional manifold.
