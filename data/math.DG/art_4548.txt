The local description of the Ricci and Bianchi identities for an
  h-normal N-linear connection on the dual 1-jet space J^{1*}(T,M)
In this paper we describe the local Ricci and Bianchi identities for an
h-normal N-linear connection D\Gamma(N) on the dual 1-jet space J^{1*}(T,M). To
reach this aim, we firstly give the expressions of the local distinguished (d-)
adapted components of torsion and curvature tensors produced by D\Gamma(N), and
then we analyze their attached local Ricci identities. The derived deflection
d-tensor identities are also presented. Finally, we expose the local
expressions of the Bianchi identities (in the particular case of an h-normal
N-linear connection of Cartan type), which geometrically connect the local
torsion and curvature d-tensors of the linear connection D\Gamma(N).
