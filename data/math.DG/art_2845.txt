On the nonexistence of quasi-Einstein metrics
We study complete Riemannian manifolds satisfying the equation $Ric+\nabla^2
f-\frac{1}{m}df\otimes df=0$ by studying the associated PDE $\Delta_f f + m\mu
e^{2f/m}=0$ for $\mu\leq 0$. By developing a gradient estimate for $f$, we show
there are no nonconstant solutions. We then apply this to show that there are
no nontrivial Ricci flat warped products with fibers which have nonpositive
Einstein constant. We also show that for nontrivial steady gradient Ricci
solitons, the quantity $R+|\nabla f|^2$ is a positive constant.
