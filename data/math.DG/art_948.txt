Limiting behaviour of the Ricci flow
We will consider a {\it $\tau$-flow}, given by the equation
$\frac{d}{dt}g_{ij} = -2R_{ij} + \frac{1}{\tau}g_{ij}$ on a closed manifold
$M$, for all times $t\in [0,\infty)$. We will prove that if the curvature
operator and the diameter of $(M,g(t))$ are uniformly bounded along the flow,
then we have a sequential convergence of the flow toward the solitons.
