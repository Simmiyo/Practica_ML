Transplanting geometrical structures
We say that a germ G of a geometric structure can be transplanted into a
manifold M if there is a suitable geometric structure on M which agrees with G
on a neighborhood of some point P of M. We show for a wide variety of geometric
structures that this transplantation is always possible provided that M does in
fact admit some such structure of this type. We use this result to show that a
curvature identity which holds in the category of compact manifolds admitting
such a structure holds for germs as well and we present examples illustrating
this result. We also use this result to show geometrical realization problems
which can be solved for germs of structures can in fact be solved in the
compact setting as well.
