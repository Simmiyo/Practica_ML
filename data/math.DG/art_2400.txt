Convergence of compact Ricci solitons
We show that sequences of compact gradient Ricci solitons converge to
complete orbifold gradient solitons, assuming constraints on volume, the
$L^{n/2}$-norm of curvature, and the auxiliary constant $C_1$. The strongest
results are in dimension 4, where $L^2$ curvature bounds are equivalent to
upper bounds on the Euler number. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions
for limits to be compact.
