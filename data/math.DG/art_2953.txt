Invariant Bilinear Differential Pairings on Parabolic Geometries
This thesis is concerned with the theory of invariant bilinear differential
pairings on parabolic geometries. It introduces the concept formally with the
help of the jet bundle formalism and provides a detailed analysis. More
precisely, after introducing the most important notations and definitions, we
first of all give an algebraic description for pairings on homogeneous spaces
and obtain a first existence theorem. Next, a classification of first order
invariant bilinear differential pairings is given under exclusion of certain
degenerate cases that are related to the existence of invariant linear
differential operators. Furthermore, a concrete formula for a large class of
invariant bilinear differential pairings of arbitrary order is given and many
examples are computed. The general theory of higher order invariant bilinear
differential pairings turns out to be much more intricate and a general
construction is only possible under exclusion of finitely many degenerate cases
whose significance in general remains elusive (although a result for projective
geometry is included). The construction relies on so-called splitting operators
examples of which are described for projective geometry, conformal geometry and
CR geometry in the last chapter.
