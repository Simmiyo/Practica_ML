Abstract Bergman kernel expansion and its applications
We give a purely complex geometric proof of the existence of the Bergman
kernel expansion. Our method provides a sharper estimate, and in the case that
the metrics are real analytic, we prove that the remainder decays faster than
any polynomial.
