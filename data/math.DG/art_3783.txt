Möbius invariant energies and average linking with circles
We define and study a M\"obius invariant energy associated to planar domains,
as well its generalization to space curves. This generalization is a M\"obius
version of Banchoff-Pohl's notion of area enclosed by a space curve. A relation
with Gauss-Bonnet theorems for complete surfaces in hyperbolic space is also
described.
