Monge-Ampere equations and generalized complex geometry. The
  two-dimensional case
We associate an integrable generalized complex structure to each
2-dimensional symplectic Monge-Amp\`ere equation of divergent type and, using
the Gualtieri $\bar{\partial}$ operator, we characterize the conservation laws
and the generating function of such equation as generalized holomorphic
objects.
