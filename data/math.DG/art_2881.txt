The Kähler-Ricci flow on Hirzebruch surfaces
We investigate the metric behavior of the Kahler-Ricci flow on the Hirzebruch
surfaces, assuming the initial metric is invariant under a maximal compact
subgroup of the automorphism group. We show that, in the sense of
Gromov-Hausdorff, the flow either shrinks to a point, collapses to
$\mathbb{P}^1$ or contracts an exceptional divisor, confirming a conjecture of
Feldman-Ilmanen-Knopf. We also show that similar behavior holds on
higher-dimensional analogues of the Hirzebruch surfaces.
