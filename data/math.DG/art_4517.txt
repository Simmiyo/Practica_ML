Generalized polar transforms of spacelike isothermic surfaces
In this paper, we generalize the polar transforms of spacelike isothermic
surfaces in $Q^4_1$ to n-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian space forms $Q^n_r$. We
show that there exist $c-$polar spacelike isothermic surfaces derived from a
spacelike isothermic surface in $Q^n_r$, which are into $S^{n+1}_r(c)$,
$H^{n+1}_{r-1}(c)$ or $Q^n_r$ depending on $c>0,<0,$ or $=0$. The $c-$polar
isothermic surfaces can be characterized as generalized $H-$surfaces with null
minimal sections. We also prove that if both the original surface and its
$c-$polar surface are closed immersion, then they have the same Willmore
functional. As examples, we discuss some product surfaces and compute the
$c-$polar transforms of them. In the end, we derive the permutability theorems
for $c-$polar transforms and Darboux transform and spectral transform of
isothermic surfaces.
