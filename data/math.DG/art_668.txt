Plurisubharmonic functions and the Kaehler-Ricci flow
We prove a linear trace Li-Yau-Hamilton inequality for the Kaehler-Ricci
flow. We then use this sharp differential inequality to study the Liouville
properties of the plurisubharmonic functions on complete Kaehler manifolds with
nonnegative bisectional curvature.
