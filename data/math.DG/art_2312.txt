A proof of the DDVV conjecture and its equality case
In this paper, we give a proof of the DDVV conjecture which is a pointwise
inequality involving the scalar curvature, the normal scalar curvature and the
mean curvature on a submanifold of a real space form. Furthermore we solved the
problem of its equality case.
