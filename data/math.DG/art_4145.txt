A mild generalization of almost-Schur lemma
In this short note we establish an integral geometric inequality in a smooth
metric measure space of the nonnegative Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature. This
result can be regarded as a mild generalization of the almost Schur theorem due
to De Lellis and Topping (Calc. Var., DOI: 10.1007/s00526-011-0413-z).
