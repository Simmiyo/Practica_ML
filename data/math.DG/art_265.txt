Seeley's Theory of Pseudodifferential Operators on Orbifolds
We present the theory of pseudodifferential operators acting on a vector
orbibundle over an orbifold, construct the zeta function of an elliptic
pseudodifferential operator and show the existence of a meromorphic extension
to the complex plane with at most simple poles. We give formulas for
generalized densities on the orbifold whose integrals compute the residues of
the zeta function.
