Einstein Hermitian Metrics of Positive Sectional Curvature
In this paper we will prove that the only compact 4-manifold M with an
Einstein metric of positive sectional curvature which is also hermitian with
respect to some complex structure on M, is the complex projective plane CP^2,
with its Fubini-Study metric.
