Semi-slant Riemannian maps
As a generalization of slant submersions (Sahin, 2011), semi-slant
submersions (Park and Prasad), and slant Riemannian maps (Sahin), we define the
notion of semi-slant Riemannian maps from almost Hermitian manifolds to
Riemannian manifolds. We study the integrability of distributions, the geometry
of fibers, the harmonicity of such maps, etc. We also find a condition for such
maps to be totally geodesic and investigate some decomposition theorems.
Moreover, we give examples.
