On the mean curvature of a unit vector field
We present an explicit formula for the mean curvature of a unit vector field
on a Riemannian manifold, using a special but natural frame. As applications,
we treat some known and new examples of minimal unit vector fields. We also
give an example of a vector field of constant mean curvature on the Lobachevsky
$(n+1)$ space.
