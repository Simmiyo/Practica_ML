Compatible and Almost Compatible Pseudo-Riemannian Metrics
Notions of compatible and almost compatible pseudo-Riemannian metrics, which
are motivated by the theory of compatible (local and nonlocal) Poisson
structures of hydrodynamic type and generalize the notion of flat pencil of
metrics, are introduced and studied.
