Darboux Approach to Bertrand Surface Offsets
In this paper, we study Bertrand surface offsets by considering the dual
geodesic trihedron(dual Darboux frame) of the ruled surfaces. We obtain the
relationships between the invariants of Bertrand trajectory ruled surfaces.
Furthermore, we obtain the conditions for these surface offset to be
developable.
