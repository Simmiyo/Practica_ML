Examples of Einstein manifolds in odd dimensions
We construct Einstein metrics of non-positive scalar curvature on certain
solid torus bundles over a Fano Kahler-Einstein manifold. We show, among other
things, that the negative Einstein metrics are conformally compact, and the
Ricci-flat metrics have slower-than-Euclidean volume growth and quadratic
curvature decay. Also we construct positive Einstein metrics on certain
3-sphere bundles over a Fano Kahler-Einstein manifold. We classify the
homeomorphism and diffeomorphism types of the total spaces when the base is the
complex projective plane.
