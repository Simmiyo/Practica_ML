A Fast Octree-Based Algorithm for Computing Ropelength
The ropelength of a space curve is usually defined as the quotient of its
length by its thickness: the radius of the largest embedded tube around the
knot. This idea was extended to space polygons by Eric Rawdon, who gave a
definition of ropelength in terms of doubly-critical self-distances (local
minima of the distance function on pairs of points on the polygon) and a
function of the exterior angles of the polygon.
  A naive algorithm for finding the doubly-critical self-distances of an n-edge
polygon involves comparing each pair of edges, and so takes O(n^2) time. In
this paper, we describe an improved algorithm, based on the notion of octrees,
which runs in O(n log n) time. The speed of the ropelength computation controls
the performance of ropelength-minimizing programs such as Rawdon and Piatek's
TOROS.
