On the decomposition of global conformal invariants I
This is the first of two papers where we address and partially confirm a
conjecture of Deser and Schwimmer, originally postulated in high energy
physics.
  The objects of study are scalar Riemannian quantities constructed out of the
curvature and its covariant derivatives, whose integrals over compact manifolds
are invariant under conformal changes of the underlying metric. Our main
conclusion is that each such quantity that locally depends only on the
curvature tensor (without covariant derivatives) can be written as a linear
combination of the Chern-Gauss-Bonnet integrand and a scalar conformal
invariant.
