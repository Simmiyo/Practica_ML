Curvature estimates for submanifolds in warped products
We give estimates on the intrinsic and the extrinsic curvature of manifolds
that are isometrically immersed as cylindrically bounded submanifolds of warped
products. We also address extensions of the results in the case of submanifolds
of the total space of a Riemannian submersion.
