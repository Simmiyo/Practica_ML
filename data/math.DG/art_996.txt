Complete k-curvature homogeneous pseudo-Riemannian manifolds
For any k which is at least 2, we exhibit complete k-curvature homogeneous
neutral signature pseudo-Riemannian manifolds which are not k+1-affine
curvature homogeneous, and hence not locally homogeneous. All the local scalar
Weyl invariants of these manifolds vanish. These manifolds are Ricci flat,
Osserman, and Ivanov-Petrova.
