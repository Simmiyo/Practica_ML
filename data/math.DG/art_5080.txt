From Global to Local: an index bound for umbilic points on smooth convex
  surfaces
We prove that the half-integer valued index of an isolated umbilic point on a
smooth convex surface in Euclidean 3-space is less than 2. This follows from a
localization of the authors' proof of the global Caratheodory conjecture.
  The link between the two is a semi-local technique that we term "totally real
blow-up". Topologically, given a real surface in a complex surface, the totally
real blow-up is the connect sum of the real surface with an embedded real
projective plane. We show that this increases the sum of the complex indices of
the real surface by 1, and hence cancels isolated hyperbolic complex points.
  This leads to a reduction of the local result to the global result (the
non-existence of embedded Lagrangian surfaces with a single complex point),
which proves that the umbilic index for smooth surfaces is less than 2.
  Comparison of our smooth result with that of Hans Hamburger in the real
analytic case (stating that the index of an isolated umbilic point on a real
analytic convex surface is less than or equal to 1) suggests the existence of
"exotic" umbilic points of index 3/2.
