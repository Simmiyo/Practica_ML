Examples of signature (2,2) manifolds with commuting curvature operators
We exhibit Walker manifolds of signature (2,2) with various commutativity
properties for the Ricci operator, the skew-symmetric curvature operator, and
the Jacobi operator. If the Walker metric is a Riemannian extension of an
underlying affine structure A, these properties are related to the Ricci tensor
of A.
