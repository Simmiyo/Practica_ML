Convergence of Kahler-Einstein orbifolds
We proved the convergence of a sequence of 2 dimensional comapct
Kahler-Einstein orbifolds with rational quotient singularities and with some
uniform bounds on the volumes and on the Euler characteristics of our orbifods
to a Kahler-Einstein 2-dimensional orbifold. Our limit orbifold can have worse
singularities than the orbifolds in our sequence. We will also derive some
estimates on the norms of the sections of plurianticanonical bundles of our
orbifolds in the sequence that we are considering and our limit orbifold.
