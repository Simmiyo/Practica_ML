Kaehler Metrics Generated by Functions of the Time-Like Distance in the
  Flat Kaehler-Lorentz Space
We prove that every Kaehler metric, whose potential is a function of the
time-like distance in the flat Kaehler-Lorentz space, is of quasi-constant
holomorphic sectional curvatures, satisfying certain conditions. This gives a
local classification of the Kaehler manifolds with the above mentioned metrics.
New examples of Sasakian space forms are obtained as real hypersurfaces of a
Kaehler space form with special invariant distribution. We introduce three
types of even dimensional rotational hypersurfaces in flat spaces and endow
them with locally conformal Kaehler structures. We prove that these rotational
hypersurfaces carry Kaehler metrics of quasi-constant holomorphic sectional
curvatures satisfying some conditions, corresponding to the type of the
hypersurfaces. The meridians of those rotational hypersurfaces, whose Kaehler
metrics are Bochner-Kaehler (especially of constant holomorphic sectional
curvatures) are also described.
