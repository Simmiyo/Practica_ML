Homogeneity and projective equivalence of differential equation fields
We propose definitions of homogeneity and projective equivalence for systems
of ordinary differential equations of order greater than two, which allow us to
generalize the concept of a spray (for systems of order two). We show that the
Euler-Lagrange fields of parametric Lagrangians of order greater than one which
are regular (in a natural sense that we define) form a projective equivalence
class of homogeneous systems. We show further that the geodesics, or base
integral curves, of projectively equivalent homogeneous differential equation
fields are the same apart from orientation-preserving reparametrization; that
is, homogeneous differential equation fields determine systems of paths.
