Two-dimensional Dirac operator and surface theory
We give a survey on the Weierstrass representations of surfaces in three- and
four-dimensional spaces, their applications to the theory of the Willmore
functional and on related problems of spectral theory of the two-dimensional
Dirac operator with periodic coefficients.
