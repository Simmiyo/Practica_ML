The size of isoperimetric surfaces in 3-manifolds and a rigidity result
  for the upper hemisphere
We characterize the standard $\mathbb{S}^3$ as the closed Ricci-positive
3-manifold with scalar curvature at least 6 having isoperimetric surfaces of
largest area: $4\pi$. As a corollary we answer in the affirmative an
interesting special case of a conjecture of Min-Oo's on the scalar curvature
rigidity of the upper hemisphere..
