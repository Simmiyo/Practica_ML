On Curvatures of Sections of Tensor Bundles
We consider natural differential operations acting on sections of tensor
vector bundles. Arrising problems can be reformulated as invariant theoretical
problems (the IT-reduction). We give examples of usage of the IT-reduction. In
particular, on a manifold with a connection and a Poisson structure we
construct the canonical quantization.
