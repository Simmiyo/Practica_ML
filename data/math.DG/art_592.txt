The Jordan normal form of higher order Osserman algebraic curvature
  tensors
We construct new examples of algebraic curvature tensors so that the Jordan
normal form of the higher order Jacobi operator is constant on the Grassmannian
of subspaces of type $(r,s)$ in a vector space of signature $(p,q)$. We then
use these examples to establish some results concerning higher order Osserman
and higher order Jordan Osserman algebraic curvature tensors.
