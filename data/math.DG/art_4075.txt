On the positive mass theorem for manifolds with corners
We study the positive mass theorem for certain non-smooth metrics following
P. Miao's work. Our approach is to smooth the metric using the Ricci flow. As
well as improving some previous results on the behaviour of the ADM mass under
the Ricci flow, we extend the analysis of the zero mass case to higher
dimensions.
