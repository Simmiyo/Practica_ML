A McLean Theorem for the moduli space of Lie solutions to mass transport
  equations
On compact manifolds which are not simply connected, we prove the existence
of "fake" solutions to the optimal transportion problem. These maps preserve
volume and arise as the exponential of a closed 1 form, hence appear
geometrically like optimal transport maps. The set of such solutions forms a
manifold with dimension given by the first Betti number of the manifold. In the
process, we prove a Hodge-Helmholtz decomposition for vector fields. The ideas
are motivated by the analogies between special Lagrangian submanifolds and
solutions to optimal transport problems.
