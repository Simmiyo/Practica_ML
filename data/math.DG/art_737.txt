Geometry of 3-Dimensional Gradient Ricci Solitons with Positive
  Curvature
We mainly study 3-dimensional complete gradient Ricci solitons with positive
sectional curvature, whose scalar curvature attains its maximum at some point.
In section 2, we estimate the area growth of level sets and the volume growth
of sublevel sets of a Ricci potential. In section 3, we show that the scalar
curvature of such solitons approaches zero at infinity. In section 4, we
investigate the geometry of such solitons at infinity, e.g., the tangent cone,
the asymptotic behavior, etc.
