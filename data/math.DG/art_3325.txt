Submanifolds of a complex space form, whose geodesics lie in 1 -
  dimensional complex submanifolds
It is proved, that if M is a connected, complete submanifold of a complex
space form N and each geodesic of M lies in an 1-dimensional totally geodesic
complex submanifold of N, then M is totally geodesic in N and is a real space
form or a complex space form.
