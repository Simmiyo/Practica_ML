Integral geometry under $G_2$ and $Spin(7)$
A Hadwiger-type theorem for the exceptional Lie groups $G_2$ and $Spin(7)$ is
proved. The algebras of $G_2$ or $Spin(7)$ invariant, translation invariant
continuous valuations are both of dimension 10. Geometrically meaningful bases
are constructed and the algebra structures are computed. Finally, the kinematic
formulas for these groups are determined.
