Variational Approach to Differential Invariants of Rank 2 Vector
  Distributions
In the present paper we construct differential invariants for generic rank 2
vector distributions on n-dimensional manifold. In the case n=5 (the first case
containing functional parameters) E. Cartan found in 1910 the covariant
fourth-order tensor invariant for such distributions, using his
"reduction-prolongation" procedure. After Cartan's work the following questions
remained open: first the geometric reason for existence of Cartan's tensor was
not clear; secondly it was not clear how to generalize this tensor to other
classes of distributions; finally there were no explicit formulas for
computation of Cartan's tensor. Our paper is the first in the series of papers,
where we develop an alternative approach, which gives the answers to the
questions mentioned above. It is based on the investigation of dynamics of the
field of so-called abnormal extremals (singular curves) of rank 2 distribution
and on the general theory of unparametrized curves in the Lagrange
Grassmannian, developed in our previous works with A. Agrachev . In this way we
construct the fundamental form and the projective Ricci curvature of rank 2
vector distributions for arbitrary n greater than 4.
  For n=5 we give an explicit method for computation of these invariants and
demonstrate it on several examples. In our next paper we show that in the case
n=5 our fundamental form coincides with Cartan's tensor.
