Topology of complete Finsler manifolds with radial flag curvature
  bounded below
We recently established a Toponogov type triangle comparison theorem for a
certain class of Finsler manifolds whose radial flag curvatures are bounded
below by that of a von Mangoldt surface of revolution (arXiv:1205.3913). In
this article, as its applications, we prove the finiteness of topological type
and a diffeomorphism theorem to Euclidean spaces.
