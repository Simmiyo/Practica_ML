The partial positivity of the curvature in Riemannian symmetric spaces
In this paper, we determine the partial positivity(resp., negativity) of the
curvature of all irreducible Riemannian symmetric spaces. From the
classifications of abstract root systems and maximal subsystems, we can give
the calculations for symmetric spaces both in classical types and in
exceptional types.
