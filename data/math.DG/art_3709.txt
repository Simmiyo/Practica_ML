Preliminary group classification for generalized inviscid Burger's
  equation
Preliminary group classification for a class of generalized inviscid Burger's
equations in the general form $u_t+g(x, u)u_x = f(x, u)$ is given and
additional equivalence transformations are found. Adduced results complete and
essentially generalize recent works on the subject . A number of new
interesting nonlinear invariant models which have non-trivial invariance
algebras are obtained. The result of the work is a wide class of equations
summarized in table form.
