On parallel and symmetric 2-tensorfields on cones over pseudo-Riemannian
  manifolds
In this article, we study complete pseudo-Riemannian manifolds whose cone
admits a parallel symmetric 2-tensorfield. The situation splits in three cases:
nilpotent, decomposable or complex Riemannian. In the complex Riemannian and
decomposable cases we provide a classification. In the nilpotent case, we are
able to describe completely only a dense open subset of the manifold. To
conclude, we give examples with non-constant curvature in the nilpotent case.
