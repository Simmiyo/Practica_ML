Plenty of Morse functions by perturbing with sums of squares
Given a smooth function f on R^n and a submanifold M, we prove that the set
of diagonal quadratic forms q such that the restriction of f+q to M is Morse is
a dense set (in the n-dimensional space of diagonal quadratic forms). The
standard transversality argument seems not to work and we need a more refined
approach.
