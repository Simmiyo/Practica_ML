On Multiplier Hermitian Structures on Compact Kahler Manifolds
Mabuchi introduced multiplier Hermitian structures on compact Kahler
manifolds and defined metrics similar to Kahler-Einstein metrics under these
structures. In this note we generalize the inequality of Moser-Trudinger type
on Kahler-Einstein manifolds to this case.
