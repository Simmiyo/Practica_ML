Mean Curvature Flow and Bernstein-Calabi Results for Spacelike Graphs
This is a survey of our work on spacelike graphic submanifolds in
pseudo-Riemannian products, namely on Heinz-Chern and Bernstein-Calabi results
and on the mean curvature flow, with applications to the homotopy of maps
between Riemannian manifolds.
