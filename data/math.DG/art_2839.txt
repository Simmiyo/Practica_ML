Geometric Realizations of para-Hermitian curvature models
We show that a para-Hermitian algebraic curvature model satisfies the
para-Gray identity if and only if it is geometrically realizable by a
para-Hermitian manifold. This requires extending the Tricerri-Vanhecke
curvature decomposition to the para-Hermitian setting. Additionally, the
geometric realization can be chosen to have constant scalar curvature and
constant *-scalar curvature.
