Cohomogeneity one actions on symmetric spaces of noncompact type
An isometric action of a Lie group on a Riemannian manifold is of
cohomogeneity one if the corresponding orbit space is one-dimensional. In this
article we develop a conceptual approach to the classification of cohomogeneity
one actions on Riemannian symmetric spaces of noncompact type in terms of orbit
equivalence. As a consequence, we find many new examples of cohomogeneity one
actions on Riemannian symmetric spaces of noncompact type. We apply our
conceptual approach to derive explicit classifications of cohomogeneity one
actions on some symmetric spaces.
