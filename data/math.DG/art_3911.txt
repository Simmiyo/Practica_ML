Slant and Semi-Slant Submanifolds of a Lorentzian Almost Paracontact
  Manifold
In this paper we define and study the slant and semi-slant submanifolds of a
Lorentzian almost paracontact manifold. Some necessary and sufficient
conditions for a submanifold of a Lorentzian almost paracontact manifold to be
slant are obtained. We give some examples for the slant and semi-slant
submanifolds of a Lorentzian almost paracontact manifold. We also investigate
the integrability conditions for the distributions involved in the definition
of a semi-slant submanifold when the ambient manifold is a Lorentzian
paracosymplectic and a Lorentzian para-Sasakian manifold, respectively.
