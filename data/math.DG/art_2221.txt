The sectional curvature remains positive when taking quotients by
  certain nonfree actions
We study some cases when the sectional curvature remains positive under the
taking of quotients by certain nonfree isometric actions of Lie groups. We
consider the actions of the groups $S^1$ and $S^3$ such that the quotient space
can be endowed with a smooth structure using the fibrations
$S^3/S^1{\simeq}S^2$ and $S^7/S^3\simeq S^4$. We prove that the quotient space
carries a metric of positive sectional curvature, provided that the original
metric has positive sectional curvature on all 2-planes orthogonal to the
orbits of the action.
