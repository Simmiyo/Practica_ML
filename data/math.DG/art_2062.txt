Eigenvalues of the transversal Dirac operator on Kahler foliations
In this paper, we prove Kirchberg inequalities for any kahler spin
foliations. Their limiting cases are then characterized as being transversal
minimal Einstein foliations. The key point is to introduce the transversal
kahlerian twistor operators.
