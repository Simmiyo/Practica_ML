An isospectral deformation on an orbifold quotient of a nilmanifold
We construct a Laplace isospectral deformation of metrics on an orbifold
quotient of a nilmanifold. Each orbifold in the deformation contains singular
points with order two isotropy. Isospectrality is obtained by modifying a
generalization of Sunada's Theorem due to DeTurck and Gordon.
