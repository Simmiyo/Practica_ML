Conformal Structure of Minimal Surfaces with Finite Topology
In this paper, we show that a complete embedded minimal surface in $\Real^3$
with finite topology and one end is conformal to a once-punctured compact
Riemann surface. Moreover, using the conformality and embeddedness, we examine
the Weierstrass data and conclude that every such surface has Weierstrass data
asymptotic to that of the helicoid. More precisely, if $g$ is the stereographic
projection of the Gauss map, then in a neighborhood of the puncture, $g(p) =
\exp(i\alpha z(p) + F(p))$, where $\alpha \in \Real$, $z=x_3+ix_3^*$ is a
holomorphic coordinate defined in this neighborhood and $F(p)$ is holomorphic
in the neighborhood and extends over the puncture with a zero there. This
further implies that the end is actually Hausdorff close to a helicoid.
