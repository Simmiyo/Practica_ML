Weil-Petersson perspectives
We highlight recent progresses in the study of the Weil-Petersson (WP)
geometry of finite dimensional Teichm\"{u}ller spaces. For recent progress on
and the understanding of infinite dimensional Teichm\"{u}ller spaces the reader
is directed to the recent work of Teo-Takhtajan. As part of the highlight, we
also present possible directions for future investigations.
