A note on the splitting theorem for the weighted measure
In this paper we study complete manifolds equipped with smooth measures whose
spectrum of the weighted Laplacian has an optimal positive lower bound and the
$m$-dimensional Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature is bounded from below by some
negative constant. In particular, we prove a splitting type theorem for
complete smooth measure manifolds that have a finite weighted volume end. This
result is regarded as a study of the equality case of an author's theorem (J.
Math. Anal. Appl. 361 (2010) 10-18).
