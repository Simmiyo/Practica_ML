Rigidity of area minimizing tori in 3-manifolds of nonnegative scalar
  curvature
The following version of a conjecture of Fischer-Colbrie and Schoen is
proved: If M is a complete Riemannian 3-manifold with nonnegative scalar
curvature which contains a two-sided torus S which is of least area in its
isotopy class then M is flat. This follows from a local version derived in the
paper.
