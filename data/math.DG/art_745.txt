Harmonic morphisms between degenerate semi-Riemannian manifolds
In this paper we generalize harmonic maps and morphisms to the
\emph{degenerate semi-Riemannian category}, in the case when the manifolds $M$
and $N$ are \emph{stationary} and the map $\phi :M\to N$ is
\emph{radical-preserving}. We characterize geometrically the notion of
\emph{(generalized) horizontal (weak) conformality} and we obtain a
characterization for (generalized) harmonic morphisms in terms of (generalized)
harmonic maps.
