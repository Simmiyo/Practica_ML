Stretching three-holed spheres and the Margulis invariant
This paper applies the authors' forthcoming work, "Affine deformations of a
three-holed sphere" in Lorentzian geometry to prove a result in hyperbolic
geometry. Namely, an infinitesimal deformation of a hyperbolic structure of a
three-holed sphere which infinitesimally lengthens the three boundary
components infinitesimally lengthens every closed geodesic. The proof
interprets the derivative of the geodesic length function as the Margulis
invariant (signed marked Lorentzian length spectrum) of the corresponding
affine deformation. The aforementioned results imply that the affine
deformation is proper, and hence by Margulis's Opposite Sign Lemma, every
closed geodesic infinitesimmaly lengthens.
