Harmonic maps and constant mean curvature surfaces in $\H^2 \times \R$
We introduce a hyperbolic Gauss map into the Poincare disk for any surface in
H^2xR with regular vertical projection, and prove that if the surface has
constant mean curvature H=1/2, this hyperbolic Gauss map is harmonic.
Conversely, we show that every nowhere holomorphic harmonic map from an open
simply connected Riemann surface into the Poincare disk is the hyperbolic Gauss
map of a two-parameter family of such surfaces. As an application we obtain
that any holomorphic quadratic differential on the surface can be realized as
the Abresch-Rosenberg holomorphic differential of some, and generically
infinitely many, complete surfaces with H=1/2 in H^2xR. A similar result
applies to minimal surfaces in the Heisenberg group Nil_3.
  Finally, we classify all complete minimal vertical graphs in H^2xR.
