Sigma Models, Minimal Surfaces and Some Ricci Flat Pseudo Riemannian
  Geometries
We consider the sigma models where the base metric is proportional to the
metric of the configuration space. We show that the corresponding sigma model
equation admits a Lax pair. We also show that this type of sigma models in two
dimensions are intimately related to the minimal surfaces in a flat pseudo
Riemannian 3-space. We define two dimensional surfaces conformally related to
the minimal surfaces in flat three dimensional geometries which enable us to
give a construction of the metrics of some even dimensional Ricci flat pseudo
Riemannian geometries.
