Moment maps and Isoparametric hypersurfaces in spheres --- Hermitian
  cases
We are studying a relationship between isoparametric hypersurfaces in spheres
with four distinct principal curvatures and the moment maps of certain
Hamiltonian actions. In this paper, we consider the isoparametric hypersurfaces
obtained from the isotropy representations of compact irreducible Hermitian
symmetric spaces of rank two. We prove that the Cartan-M\"unzner polynomials of
these hypersurfaces can be written as squared-norms of the moment maps for some
Hamiltonian actions. The proof is based on the structure theory of symmetric
spaces.
