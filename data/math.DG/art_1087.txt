Biconformal changes of metric and pseudo-harmonic morphisms
Pseudo-harmonic morphisms give rise on the domain space to a distribution
which admits an almost complex structure compatible with the given Riemannian
metric. We shall show that this property, together with the harmonicity, are
preserved by a biconformal change of the domain metric. The special case of the
pseudo-horizontally homothetic harmonic morphisms is also treated.
