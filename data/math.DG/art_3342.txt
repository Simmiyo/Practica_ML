Constrained Willmore Surfaces: Symmetries of a Moebius Invariant
  Integrable System
This work is dedicated to the study of the Moebius invariant class of
constrained Willmore surfaces and its symmetries. We define a spectral
deformation by the action of a loop of flat metric connections; Baecklund
transformations, by applying a dressing action; and, in 4-space, Darboux
transformations, based on the solution of a Riccati equation. We establish a
permutability between spectral deformation and Baecklund transformation and
prove that non-trivial Darboux transformation of constrained Willmore surfaces
in 4-space can be obtained as a particular case of Baecklund transformation.
All these transformations corresponding to the zero multiplier preserve the
class of Willmore surfaces. We verify that, for special choices of parameters,
both spectral deformation and Baecklund transformation preserve the class of
constrained Willmore surfaces admitting a conserved quantity, and, in
particular, the class of CMC surfaces in 3-dimensional space-form.
