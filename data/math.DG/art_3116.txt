Conformal Structures Associated to Generic Rank 2 Distributions on
  5-Manifolds - Characterization and Killing-Field Decomposition
Given a maximally non-integrable 2-distribution ${\mathcal D}$ on a
5-manifold $M$, it was discovered by P. Nurowski that one can naturally
associate a conformal structure $[g]_{\mathcal D}$ of signature (2,3) on $M$.
We show that those conformal structures $[g]_{\mathcal D}$ which come about by
this construction are characterized by the existence of a normal conformal
Killing 2-form which is locally decomposable and satisfies a genericity
condition. We further show that every conformal Killing field of $[g]_{\mathcal
D}$ can be decomposed into a symmetry of ${\mathcal D}$ and an almost Einstein
scale of $[g]_{\mathcal D}$.
