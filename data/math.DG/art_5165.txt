A Condition Ensuring Spatial Curves Develop Type-II Singularities Under
  Curve Shortening Flow
We provide a condition for spatial curves which rules out the development of
a type I singularity. The condition is that after the last time for which an
inflection point develops, if the torsion is ever everywhere non-negative, the
curve cannot develop a type I singularity.
