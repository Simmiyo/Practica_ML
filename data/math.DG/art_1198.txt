Transforms for minimal surfaces in the 5-sphere
We define two transforms between minimal surfaces with non-circular ellipse
of curvature in the 5-sphere, and show how this enables us to construct, from
one such surface, a sequence of such surfaces. We also use the transforms to
show how to associate to such a surface a corresponding ruled minimal
Lagrangian submanifold of complex projective 3-space. We illustrate this
explicitly in the case of bipolar minimal surfaces.
