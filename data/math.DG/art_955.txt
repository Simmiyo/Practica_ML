Convergence of a Kähler-Ricci flow
In this paper we prove that for a given K\"ahler-Ricci flow with uniformly
bounded Ricci curvatures in an arbitrary dimension, for every sequence of times
$t_i$ converging to infinity, there exists a subsequence such that $(M,g(t_i +
t))\to (Y,\bar{g}(t))$ and the convergence is smooth outside a singular set
(which is a set of codimension at least 4) to a solution of a flow. We also
prove that in the case of complex dimension 2, without any curvature
assumptions we can find a subsequence of times such that we have a convergence
to a K\"ahler-Ricci soliton, away from finitely many isolated singularities.
