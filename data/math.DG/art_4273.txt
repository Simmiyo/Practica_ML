Extremal Kähler metrics and energy functionals on projective bundles
In this paper, we prove the equivalence of the existence of extremal Kahler
metrics and the properness of the modified K energy on projective bundles.
Moreover, we discuss the relations of the lower boundedness of the K energy,
the infimum of the Calabi energy and the extremal polynomials. In particular,
we give an example where the modified K energy is bounded from below but not
proper.
