Embedded minimal and constant mean curvature annulus touching spheres
We show that a compact embedded minimal or constant mean curvature annulus
with non-vanishing Gaussian curvature which is tangent to two spheres of same
radius or tangent to a sphere and meeting a plane in constant contact angle is
rotational.
