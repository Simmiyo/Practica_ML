Constant $k$-curvature hypersurfaces in Riemannian manifolds
Rugang Ye proved the existence of a family of constant mean curvature
hypersurfaces in an $m+1$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M^{m+1},g)$, which
concentrate at a point $p_0$ (which is required to be a nondegenerate critical
point of the scalar curvature), moreover he proved that this family constitute
a foliation of a neighborhood of $p_0$. In this paper we extend this result to
the other curvatures (the $r$-th mean curvature for $1\le r\le m$).
