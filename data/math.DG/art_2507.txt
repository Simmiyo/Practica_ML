Torsional rigidity of submanifolds with controlled geometry
We prove explicit upper and lower bounds for the torsional rigidity of
extrinsic domains of submanifolds P^m with controlled radial mean curvature in
ambient Riemannian manifolds N^n with a pole p and with sectional curvatures
bounded from above and from below, respectively. These bounds are given in
terms of the torsional rigidities of corresponding Schwarz symmetrizations of
the domains in warped product model spaces. Our main results are obtained using
methods from previously established isoperimetric inequalities, as found in
e.g. [MP4] and [MP5]. As in [MP4] we also characterize the geometry of those
situations in which the bounds for the torsional rigidity are actually attained
and study the behavior at infinity of the so-called geometric average of the
mean exit time for Brownian motion.
