Ricci curvature and conformality of Riemannian manifolds to spheres
In this paper we give bounds for the first eigenvalue of the conformal
Laplacian and the Yamabe invariant of a compact Riemannian manifold, by using
conditions on the Ricci curvature and the diameter and deduce certain
conditions on the manifold to be conformal to a sphere.
