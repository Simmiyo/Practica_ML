Analytic Torsion and R-Torsion for Manifolds with Boundary
We prove a formula relating the analytic torsion and Reidemeister torsion on
manifolds with boundary in the general case when the metric is not necessarily
a product near the boundary. The product case has been established by W. Lu\"ck
and S. M. Vishik. We find that the extra term that comes in here in the
nonproduct case is the transgression of the Euler class in the even dimensional
case and a slightly more mysterious term involving the second fundamental form
of the boundary and the curvature tensor of the manifold in the odd dimensional
case.
