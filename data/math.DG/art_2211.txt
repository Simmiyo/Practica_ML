Lower bounds for warping functions on warped-product AHE manifolds
Let $[\gamma]$ be the conformal boundary of a warped product $C^{3,\alpha}$
AHE metric $g=g_M+u^2h$ on $N=M \times F$, where $(F,h)$ is compact with unit
volume and nonpositive curvature. We show that if $[\gamma]$ has positive
Yamabe constant, then $u$ has a positive lower bound that depends only on
$[\gamma]$.
