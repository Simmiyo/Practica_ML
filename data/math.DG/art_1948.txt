A short proof of Gromov's filling inequality
We give a very short and rather elementary proof of Gromov's filling volume
inequality for n-dimensional Lipschitz cycles (with integer and
Z_2-coefficients) in $L^\infty$-spaces. This inequality is used in the proof of
Gromov's systolic inequality for closed aspherical Riemannian manifolds and is
often regarded as the difficult step therein.
