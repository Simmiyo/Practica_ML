Flat nearly Kähler manifolds
We classify flat strict nearly K\"ahler manifolds with (necessarily)
indefinite metric. Any such manifold is locally the product of a flat
pseudo-K\"ahler factor of maximal dimension and a strict flat nearly K\"ahler
manifold of split signature $(2m,2m)$ with $m\ge 3$. Moreover, the geometry of
the second factor is encoded in a complex three-form $\zeta \in \Lambda^3
(\mathbb{C}^m)^*$. The first nontrivial example occurs in dimension $4m=12$.
