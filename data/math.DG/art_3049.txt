Geometric Structures of Collapsing Riemannian Manifolds II: N*-bundles
  and Almost Ricci Flat Spaces
In this paper we study collapsing sequences M_{i}-> X of Riemannian manifolds
with curvature bounded or bounded away from a controlled subset. We introduce a
structure over X which in an appropriate sense is dual to the N-structure of
Cheeger, Fukaya and Gromov. As opposed to the N-structure, which live over the
M_{i} themselves, this structure lives over X and allows for a convenient
notion of global convergence as well as the appropriate background structure
for doing analysis on X. This structure is new even in the case of uniformly
bounded curvature and as an application we give a generalization of Gromov's
Almost Flat Theorem and prove new Ricci pinching theorems which extend those
known in the noncollapsed setting. There are also interesting topological
consequences to the structure.
