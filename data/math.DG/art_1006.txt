Dimensional reduction of the perturbed Hermitian-Einstein equation
Given a Kaehlerian holomorphic fiber bundle whose fiber is a compact
homogeneous Kaehler manifold, we describe the perturbed Hermitian-Einstein
equations relative to certain holomorphic vector bundles. With respect to
special metrics on the holomorphic bundles, there is a dimensional reduction
procedure which reduces these equations to a system of equations on the base,
known as the twisted coupled vortex equations.
