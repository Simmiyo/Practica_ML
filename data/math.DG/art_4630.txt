On the evolution of a Hermitian metric by its Chern-Ricci form
We consider the evolution of a Hermitian metric on a compact complex manifold
by its Chern-Ricci form. This is an evolution equation first studied by M.
Gill, and coincides with the Kahler-Ricci flow if the initial metric is Kahler.
We find the maximal existence time for the flow in terms of the initial data.
We investigate the behavior of the flow on complex surfaces when the initial
metric is Gauduchon, on complex manifolds with negative first Chern class, and
on some Hopf manifolds. Finally, we discuss a new estimate for the complex
Monge-Ampere equation on Hermitian manifolds.
