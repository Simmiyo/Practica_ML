A gap theorem of self-shrinkers
In this paper, we study complete self-shrinkers in Euclidean space and prove
that an $n$-dimensional complete self-shrinker with polynomial volume growth in
Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is isometric to either $\mathbb{R}^{n}$,
$S^{n}(\sqrt{n})$, or $\mathbb{R}^{n-m}\times S^m (\sqrt{m})$, $1\leq m\leq
n-1$, if the squared norm $S$ of the second fundamental form is constant and
satisfies $S<(10/7)$.
