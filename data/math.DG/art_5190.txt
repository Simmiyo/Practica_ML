Conformal Geometric Inequalities on the Klein Bottle
We prove three optimal conformal geometric inequalities of Blatter type on
the Klein bottle. These inequalities provide conformal lower bounds of the
volume and involve lengths of homotopy classes of curves that are candidates to
realize the systole.
