About the geometry of almost para-quaternionic manifolds
We provide a general criteria for the integrability of the almost
para-quaternionic structure of an almost para-quaternionic manifold (M,P) of
dimension bigger or equal to eight, in terms of the integrability of two or
three sections of the defining rank three vector bundle P. We relate it with
the integrability of the canonical almost complex structure of the twistor
space and to the integrability of the canonical almost para-complex structure
of the reflector space of (M,P). We show that (M, P) has plenty of locally
defined, compatible, complex and para-complex structures, provided that P is
para-quaternionic.
