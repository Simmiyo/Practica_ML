A new family of curvature homogeneous pseudo-Riemannian manifolds
We construct a new family of curvature homogeneous pseudo-Riemannian
manifolds modeled on $\mathbb{R}^{3k+2}$ for integers $k \geq 1$. In contrast
to previously known examples, the signature may be chosen to be $(k+1+a,
k+1+b)$ where $a,b \in \mathbb{N} \bigcup \{0\}$ and $a+b = k$. The structure
group of the 0-model of this family is studied, and is shown to be
indecomposable. Several invariants that are not of Weyl type are found which
will show that, in general, the members of this family are not locally
homogeneous.
