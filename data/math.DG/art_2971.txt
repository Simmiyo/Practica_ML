On a Three Dimensional Riemannian Manifold with an Additional Structure
We consider a 3-dimensional Riemannian manifold with additional structure q.
We find a condition that the affine structure q is parallel with respect to the
Riamannian connection.We prove the sectional curvatures of three 2-sections
formed linearly independent vectors are equal among them.
