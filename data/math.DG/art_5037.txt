Adiabatic limit and connections in Finsler Geometry
In this paper, we identify the Bott connection on the natural foliation of
the projective sphere bundle of a Finsler manifold to the Chern connection of
this manifold. As a consequence, the symmetrization of the Bott connection
turns out to be the Cartan connection of the Finsler manifold. Following
Liu-Zhang \cite{LiuZ}, the Cartan connection can also be obtained through an
adiabatic limit process. Furthermore, a Chern-Simons type form is defined and
its conformal properties are discussed.
