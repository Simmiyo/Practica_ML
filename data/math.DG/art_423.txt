Harmonic maps in unfashionable geometries
We describe some general constructions on a real smooth projective 4-quadric
which provide analogues of the Willmore functional and conformal Gauss map in
both Lie sphere and projective differential geometry. Extrema of these
functionals are characterized by harmonicity of this Gauss map.
