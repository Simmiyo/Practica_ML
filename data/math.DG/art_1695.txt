Lectures on pure spinors and moment maps
The goal of this article is to give an elementary introduction to Dirac
geometry and group-valued moment maps, via pure spinors. The material is based
on my lectures at the summer school on 'Poisson geometry in Mathematics and
Physics' at Keio University, June 2006.
