Generalised Surfaces in ${\Bbb{R}}^3$
The correspondence between 2-parameter families of oriented lines in
${\Bbb{R}}^3$ and surfaces in $T{\Bbb{P}}^1$ is studied, and the geometric
properties of the lines are related to the complex geometry of the surface.
Congruences generated by global sections of $T{\Bbb{P}}^1$ are investigated and
a number of theorems are proven that generalise results for closed convex
surfaces in ${\Bbb{R}}^3$.
