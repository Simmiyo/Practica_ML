Collapsing and essential coverings
In the present paper, we consider the family of all compact Alexandrov spaces
with curvature bound below having a definite upper diameter bound of a fixed
dimension. We introduce the notion of essential coverings by contractible
metric balls, and provide a uniform bound on the numbers of contractible metric
balls forming essential coverings of the spaces in the family. In particular,
this gives another view for Gromov's Betti number theorem.
