Half-lightlike submanifolds with planar normal section in $R_{2}^{4}$
We investigate half-lightlike submanifolds with planar normal sections of
four dimensional pseudo Euclidean space. We obtain necessary and sufficient
conditions for a half-lightlike submanifold of $R_{2}^{4}$ such that it has
degenerate or non-degenerate planar normal sections.
