Cohomological tautness for Riemannian foliations
In this paper we present some new results on the tautness of Riemannian
foliations in their historical context. The first part of the paper gives a
short history of the problem. For a closed manifold, the tautness of a
Riemannian foliation can be characterized cohomologically. We extend this
cohomological characterization to a class of foliations which includes the
foliated strata of any singular Riemannian foliation of a closed manifold.
