Moduli space theory for constant mean curvature surfaces immersed in
  space-forms
A new method is presented for solving the Gauss-Codazzi equations for a
compact Riemann surface to be immersed in a 3-manifold of constant curvature.
In the negative curvature case, the moduli for such embeddings are cohomology
classes of (0,2) forms.
