Projective Geometry I: Principles and Properties
The aim of this paper and its sequel is to introduce and classify the
holonomy algebras of the projective Tractor connection. After a brief
historical background, this paper presents and analyses the projective Cartan
and Tractor connections, the various structures they can preserve, and their
geometric interpretations. Preserved subbundles of the Tractor bundle generate
foliations with Ricci-flat leaves. Contact- and Einstein-structures arise from
other reductions of the Tractor holonomy, as do U(1) and $Sp(1, \mathbb{H})$
bundles over a manifold of smaller dimension.
