Geometric Dynamics of Plasma in Jet Spaces with Berwald-Moor Metric
In this paper we construct the differential equations of the stream lines
that characterize plasma regarded as a non-isotropic medium geometrized by a
jet rheonomic time-invariant Berwald-Moor metric. Section 1 contains historical
notes regarding the Plasma Physics and its geometrical description. Section 2
analyzes the generalized Lagrange geometrical approach of the non-isotropic
plasma on 1-jet spaces. Section 3 studies the non-isotropic plasma as a medium
geometrized by the jet rheonomic Berwald-Moor metric.
