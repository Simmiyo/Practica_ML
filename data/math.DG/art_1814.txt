Contact Calabi-Yau manifolds and Special Legendrian submanifolds
We consider a generalization of Calabi-Yau structures in the context of
$\alpha$-Sasakian manifolds. We study deformations of a special class of
Legendrian submanifolds and classify invariant contact Calabi-Yau structures on
5-dimensional nilmanifolds. Finally we generalize to codimension $r$.
