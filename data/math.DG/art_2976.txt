Twistor Theory for CR quaternionic manifolds and related structures
In a general and non metrical framework, we introduce the class of CR
quaternionic manifolds containing the class of quaternionic manifolds, whilst
in dimension three it particularizes to, essentially, give the conformal
manifolds. We show that these manifolds have a rich natural Twistor Theory and,
along the way, we obtain a heaven space construction for quaternionic
manifolds.
