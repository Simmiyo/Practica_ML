Extrinsic curvatures of distributions of arbitrary codimension
In this article, using the generalized Newton transformation, we define
higher order mean curvatures of distributions of arbitrary codimension and we
show that they agree with the ones from Brito and Naveira (Ann. Global Anal.
Geom. 18, 371-383 (2000)). We also introduce higher order mean curvature vector
fields and we compute their divergence for certain distributions and using this
we obtain total extrinsic mean curvatures.
