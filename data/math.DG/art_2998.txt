Uniqueness of viscosity solutions of a geometric fully nonlinear
  parabolic equation
We observe that the comparison result of Barles-Biton-Ley for viscosity
solutions of a class of nonlinear parabolic equations can be applied to a
geometric fully nonlinear parabolic equation which arises from the graphic
solutions for the Lagrangian mean curvature flow.
