Automorphism groups of normal CR 3-manifolds
We classify the normal CR structures on $S^3$ and their automorphism groups.
Together with [3], this closes the classification of normal CR structures on
contact 3-manifolds. We give a criterion to compare 2 normal CR structures, and
we show that the underlying contact structure is, up to homotopy, unique.
