On dual timelike - spacelike Mannheim partner curves in ID3 1
The first aim of this paper is to define the dual timelike - spacelike
Mannheim partner curves in Dual Lorentzian Space ID3 1, the second aim of this
paper is to obtain the relationships between the curvatures and the torsions of
the dual timelike - spacelike Mannheim partner curves with respect to each
other and the final aim of this paper is to get the necessary and sufficient
conditions for the dual timelike -spacelike Mannheim partner curves in ID3 1 .
