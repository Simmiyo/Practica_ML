Geodesics on an invariant surface
We study the geodesics on an invariant surface of a three dimensional
Riemannian manifold. The main results are: the characterization of geodesic
orbits; a Clairaut's relation and its geometric interpretation in some
remarkable three dimensional spaces; the local description of the geodesics;
the explicit description of geodesic curves on an invariant surface with
constant Gauss curvature.
