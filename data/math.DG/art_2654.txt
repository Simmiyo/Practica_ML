Optimal length estimates for stable CMC surfaces in 3-space forms
In this paper, we study stable constant mean curvature $H$ surfaces in
$\R^3$. We prove that, in such a surface, the distance from a point to the
boundary is less that $\pi/(2H)$. This upper-bound is optimal and is extended
to stable constant mean curvature surfaces in space forms.
