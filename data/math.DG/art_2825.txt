Properties of Generalized Berwald Connections
Recently the present authors introduced a general class of Finsler
connections which leads to a smart representation of connection theory in
Finsler geometry and yields to a classification of Finsler connections into the
three classes. Here the properties of one of these classes namely the
Berwald-type connections which contains Berwald and Chern(Rund) connections as
a special case is studied. It is proved among the other that the hv-curvature
of these connections vanishes if and only if the Finsler space is a Berwald
one. Some applications of this connection is discussed.
