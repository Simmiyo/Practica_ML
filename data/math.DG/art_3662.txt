On the equivalence problem for manifolds of indefinite metrics
Conditions, related to Kulkarni's equivalence problem are considered for
indefinite Riemannian and Kaehlerian manifolds. Corresponding theorems are
obtained for the values of the Ricci tensor on isotropic vectors as well as for
the values of the curvature tensor on degenerate holomorphic 2-planes.
