On the three-dimensional homogeneous SO(2) - isotropic Riemannian
  manifolds
In this paper we consider some properties of the three-dimensional
homogeneous SO(2)-isotropic Riemannian manifolds. In particular, we determine
the geodesics, the totally geodesic surfaces, the totally umbilical surfaces
and the geodesics of the rotational surfaces.
