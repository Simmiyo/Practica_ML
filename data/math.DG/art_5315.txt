Scalar Curvature and Stability of Toric Fibrations
We study fibrations $\cV$ of toric varieties over the flag variety $G/T$,
where $G$ is a compact semisimple Lie group and $T$ is a maximal torus. From
symplectic data, we construct test configurations of $\cV$ and compute their
Futaki invariants by employing a generalization of Pick's Theorem. We also give
a simple form of the Mabuchi Functional.
