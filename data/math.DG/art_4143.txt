Projective Metrizability and Formal Integrability
The projective metrizability problem can be formulated as follows: under what
conditions the geodesics of a given spray coincide with the geodesics of some
Finsler space, as oriented curves. In Theorem 3.8 we reformulate the projective
metrizability problem for a spray in terms of a first-order partial
differential operator $P_1$ and a set of algebraic conditions on semi-basic
1-forms. We discuss the formal integrability of $P_1$ using two sufficient
conditions provided by Cartan-K\"ahler theorem. We prove in Theorem 4.2 that
the symbol of $P_1$ is involutive and hence one of the two conditions is always
satisfied. While discussing the second condition, in Theorem 4.3 we prove that
there is only one obstruction to the formal integrability of $P_1$, and this
obstruction is due to the curvature tensor of the induced nonlinear connection.
When the curvature obstruction is satisfied, the projective metrizability
problem reduces to the discussion of the algebraic conditions, which as we show
are always satisfied in the analytic case. Based on these results, we recover
all classes of sprays that are known to be projectively metrizable: flat
sprays, isotropic sprays, and arbitrary sprays on 1- and 2-dimensional
manifolds. We provide examples of sprays that are projectively metrizable
without being Finsler metrizable.
