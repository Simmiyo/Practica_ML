A Classification Approach for Open Manifolds
There are a least uncountably many diffeomorphism types for open manifolds.
Hence the classification problem is extremely difficult. We proceed as follows:
We define several uniform structures of proper metric spaces and consider their
arc components. Any open complete manifold (M^n,g) defines such a component.
Hence the classification amounts to two steps. First counting all components,
and secondly counting all elements inside a component. This can be partially
done by invariants. We define bordism groups and relative characteristic
numbers.
