On the Kähler classes of constant scalar curvature metrics on blow ups
In this note we clarify the structure of the moduli space of constant scalar
curvature Kaehler metrics as one approaches the boundary of the Kaehler cone on
cscK manifolds blown up at finite set of points, in the spirit of the previous
work arXiv:math/0504115. Results about which Kaehler classes can be reached and
about the position of the blown up points are given.
