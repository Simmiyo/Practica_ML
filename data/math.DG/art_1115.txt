Hölder continuity of energy minimizer maps between riemannian
  polyhedra
The goal of the present paper is to establish some kind of regularity of an
energy minimizer map between Riemannian polyhedra. More precisely, we will show
the h\"{o}lder continuity of local energy minimizers between Riemannian
polyhedra with the target spaces without focal points. With this new result, we
also complete our existence theorem obtained in [5], and consequently we
generalize completely, to the case of target polyhedra without focal points
(which is weaker geometric condition than the nonpositivity of the curvature),
the Eells-fuglede's existence and regularity theorem [12, chapters 10, 11]
which is the new version of the famous Eells-Sampson's theorem [13].
