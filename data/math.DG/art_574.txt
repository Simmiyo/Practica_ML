Rigidity of Riemannian foliations with complex leaves on Kaehler
  manifolds
We study Riemannian foliations with complex leaves on Kaehler manifolds. The
tensor T, the obstruction to the foliation be totally geodesic, is interpreted
as a holomorphic section of a certain vector bundle. This enables us to give
classification results when the manifold is compact.
