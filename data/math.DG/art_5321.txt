Chen-Gackstatter type surfaces in R^4_1: deformation, symmetry, and
  embeddedness
We find a 2-parameter family of deformations in R^4_1 of the classical
Chen-Gackstatter surface explicitly, and show the existence of a larger
4-parameter family of deformations. Each of them still has genus one, a unique
end, with total Gaussian curvature $-\int K=8\pi$. On the other hand, a
uniqueness theorem is obtained when we assume that the surface has more than 4
symmetries. The problem of embeddedness is also discussed with some partial
results.
