Almost conformal transformation in a class of Riemannian manifolds
We consider a 3-dimensional Riemannian manifold V with a metric g and an
affinor structure q. The local coordinates of these tensors are circulant
matrices. In V we define an almost conformal transformation. Using that
definition we construct an infinite series of circulant metrics which are
successively almost conformaly related. In this case we get some properties.
