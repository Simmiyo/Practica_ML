Archimedes' balance and Bianchi's Backlund transformation for quadrics
We establish a link between Archimedes' method of integration for calculating
areas, volumes and centers of mass of segments of parabolas and quadrics of
revolution by factorization via the moments of a balance and an integration
technique for a particular integrable system, namely Bianchi's B\"{a}cklund
transformation for quadrics.
