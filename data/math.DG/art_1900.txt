(Semi-)Riemannian geometry of (para-)octonionic projective planes
We use reduced homogeneous coordinates to study Riemannian geometry of the
octonionic (or Cayley) projective plane. Our method extends to the
para-octonionic (or split octonionic) projective plane, the octonionic
projective plane of indefinite signature, and the hyperbolic dual of the
octonionic projective plane; we discuss these manifolds in the later sections
of the paper.
