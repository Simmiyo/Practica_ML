Hamiltonian-minimal submanifolds in Kaehler manifolds with symmetries
By making use of the symplectic reduction and the cohomogeneity method, we
give a general method for constructing Hamiltonian minimal submanifolds in
Kaehler manifolds with symmetries. As applications, we construct infinitely
many nontrivial complete Hamiltonian minimal submanifolds in CP^n and C^n.
