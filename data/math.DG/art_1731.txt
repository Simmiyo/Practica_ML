Geometry of a pair of second-order ODEs and Euclidean spaces
This paper investigates the relationship between a system of differential
equations and the underlying geometry associated with it. The geometry of a
surface determines shortest paths, or geodesics connecting nearby points, which
are defined as the solutions to a pair of second-order differential equations:
the Euler-Lagrange equations of the arclength action. We ask when the converse
holds, that is, when solutions to a system of differential equations reveals an
underlying geometry. Specifically, when may the solutions to a pair of
second-order ordinary differential equations be reparameterized so as to give,
locally, the geodesics of a Euclidean space? Our approach is based upon
Cartan's method of equivalence. In the second part of the paper, the
equivalence problem is solved for a generic pair of second-order ODEs revealing
the existence of 24 invariant functions.
