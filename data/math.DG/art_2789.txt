Embedding into manifolds with torsion
We introduce a class of special geometries associated to the choice of a
differential graded algebra contained in \Lambda R^n. We generalize some known
embedding results, that effectively characterize the real analytic Riemannian
manifolds that can be realized as submanifolds of a Riemannian manifold with
special holonomy, to this more general context. In particular, we consider the
case of hypersurfaces inside nearly-Kaehler and alpha-Einstein-Sasaki
manifolds, proving that the corresponding evolution equations always admit a
solution in the real analytic case.
