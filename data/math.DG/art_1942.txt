Positive Self Dual Einstein Orbifolds with One-Dimensional Isometry
  Group
The aim of this thesis is to construct new examples of compact orbifolds
$\mathcal{O}^4(\Theta)$ which admit a self dual Einstein (SDE) metric of
positive scalar curvature $s>0$, with a one-dimensional group of isometries. In
particular we want to prove that these examples are different from those
described by Boyer, Galicki and Piccinni in \emph{$3-$Sasakian geometry,
nilpotents orbits, and exeptional quotients}. We construct explicitly our new
examples as quaternion-K$\ddot{\mathrm{a}}$hler reductions of the quaternion
K$\ddot{\mathrm{a}}$hler Grassmannian $Gr_4(\mathbb{R}^8)$ by an isometric
action of a $3-$torus $T^3_{\Theta}\subset T^4\subset SO(8)$ $\subset Sp(8)$ on
the sphere $S^{31}\subset \mathbb{H}^8$, where $\Theta$ is an interger $3\times
4$ weight matrix.
