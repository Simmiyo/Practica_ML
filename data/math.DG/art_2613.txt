The holomorphic Gauss Parametrization
We give a local parametric description of all holomorphic hypersurfaces in
complex Euclidean and projective spaces with constant index of relative
nullity, together with applications. This is a complex analogue to the
parametrization for real hypersurfaces in Euclidean space known as the Gauss
parametrization.
