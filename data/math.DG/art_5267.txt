Eigenvalue estimate and compactness for closed $f$-minimal surfaces
Let $\Omega$ be a bounded domain with convex boundary in a complete
noncompact Riemannian manifold with Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature bounded below
by a positive constant. We prove a lower bound of the first eigenvalue of the
weighted Laplacian for closed embedded $f$-minimal hypersurfaces contained in
$\Omega$. Using this estimate, we prove a compactness theorem for the space of
closed embedded $f$-minimal surfaces with the uniform upper bounds of genus and
diameter in a complete $3$-manifold with Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature bounded
below by a positive constant and admitting an exhaustion by bounded domains
with convex boundary.
