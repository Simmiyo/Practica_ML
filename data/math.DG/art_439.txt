Obstructions to positive curvature and symmetry
We show that the indices of certain twisted Dirac operators vanish on a
$Spin$-manifold $M$ of positive sectional curvature if the symmetry rank of $M$
is $\geq 2$ or if the symmetry rank is one and $M$ is two connected. We also
give examples of simply connected manifolds of positive Ricci curvature which
do not admit a metric of positive sectional curvature and positive symmetry
rank.
