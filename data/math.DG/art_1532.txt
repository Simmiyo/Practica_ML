Formality in generalized Kahler geometry
We prove that no nilpotent Lie algebra admits an invariant generalized
Kaehler structure. This is done by showing that a certain differential graded
algebra associated to a generalized complex manifold is formal in the
generalized Kaehler case, while it is never formal for a generalized complex
structure on a nilpotent Lie algebra.
