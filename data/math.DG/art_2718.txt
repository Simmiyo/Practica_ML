Conformally Osserman manifolds
An algebraic curvature tensor is called Osserman if the eigenvalues of the
associated Jacobi operator are constant on the unit sphere. A Riemannian
manifold is called conformally Osserman if its Weyl conformal curvature tensor
at every point is Osserman. We prove that a conformally Osserman manifold of
dimension $n \ne 3, 4, 16$ is locally conformally equivalent either to a
Euclidean space or to a rank-one symmetric space.
