Cartan equivalence problem for third order differential operators
This article is dedicated to solve the equivalence problem for two third
order differential operators on the line under general fiber--preserving
transformation using the Cartan method of equivalence. We will do three
versions of the equivalence problems: first via the direct equivalence problem,
second equivalence problem is to determine conditions on two differential
operators such that there exists a fiber-preserving transformations mapping one
to the other according to gauge equivalence.
