Intrinsic Invariants of Cross Caps
It is classically known that generic smooth maps of R^2 into R^3 admit only
cross cap singularities. This suggests that the class of cross caps might be an
important object in differential geometry. We show that the standard cross cap
(u,uv,v^2) has non-trivial isometric deformations with infinite dimensional
freedom. Since there are several geometric invariants for cross caps, the
existence of isometric deformations suggests that one can ask which invariants
of cross caps are intrinsic. In this paper, we show that there are three
fundamental intrinsic invariants for cross caps. The existence of extrinsic
invariants is also shown.
