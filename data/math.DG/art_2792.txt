The structure Jacobi operator for hypersurfaces in CP^2 and CH^2
Using the methods of moving frames, we study real hypersurfaces in complex
projective space CP^2 and complex hyperbolic space CH^2 whose structure Jacobi
operator has various special properties. Our results complement work of several
other authors who worked on such hypersurfaces in CP^n and CH^n for n>2.
