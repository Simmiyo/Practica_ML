Some Results and Characterizations for Mannheim Offsets of the Ruled
  Surfaces
In this study, we give the dual characterizations of Mannheim offsets of the
ruled surface in terms of their integral invariants and the new
characterization of the Mannheim offsets of developable surface. Furthermore,
we obtain the relationships between the area of projections of spherical images
for Mannheim offsets of ruled surfaces and their integral invariants.
