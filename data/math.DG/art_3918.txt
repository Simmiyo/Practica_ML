On globally Symmetric Finsler spaces
The paper consider the symmetric of Finsler spaces. We give some conditions
about globally symmetric Finsler spaces. Then we prove that these spaces can be
written as a coset space of Lie group with an invariant Finsler metric.
Finally, we prove that such a space must be Berwaldian
