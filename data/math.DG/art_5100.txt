The comparison of two constructions of the refined analytic torsion on
  compact manifolds with boundary
The refined analytic torsion on compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary
has been discussed by B. Vertman and the authors, but these two constructions
are completely different. Vertman used a double of de Rham complex consisting
of the minimal and maximal closed extensions of a flat connection and the
authors used well-posed boundary conditions ${\mathcal P}_{-, {\mathcal
L}_{0}}$, ${\mathcal P}_{+, {\mathcal L}_{1}}$ for the odd signature operator.
In this paper we compare these two constructions by using the BFK-gluing
formula for zeta-determinants, the adiabatic method for stretching cylinder
part near boundary and the deformation method used in [6], when the odd
signature operator comes from a Hermitian flat connection and all de Rham
cohomologies vanish.
