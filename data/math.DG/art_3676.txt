Differential Harnack inequalities for nonlinear heat equations with
  potentials under the Ricci flow
We prove several differential Harnack inequalities for positive solutions to
nonlinear backward heat equations with different potentials coupled with the
Ricci flow. We also derive an interpolated Harnack inequality for the nonlinear
heat equation under the $\varepsilon$-Ricci flow on a closed surface. These new
Harnack inequalities extend the previous differential Harnack inequalities for
linear heat equations with potentials under the Ricci flow.
