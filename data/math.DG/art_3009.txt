On Tanaka's Prolongation Procedure for Filtered Structures of Constant
  Type
We present Tanaka's prolongation procedure for filtered structures on
manifolds discovered in [Tanaka N., J. Math. Kyoto. Univ. 10 (1970), 1-82] in a
spirit of Singer-Sternberg's description of the prolongation of usual
G-structures [Singer I.M., Sternberg S., J. Analyse Math. 15 (1965), 1-114;
Sternberg S., Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1964]. This approach
gives a transparent point of view on the Tanaka constructions avoiding many
technicalities of the original Tanaka paper.
