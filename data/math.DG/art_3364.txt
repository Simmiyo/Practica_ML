A de Rham theorem with respect to the Liouville foliation on TM^0, for a
  Finsler manifold M
On the slit tangent manifold of a Finsler manifold M are given the vertical
and the Liouville foliations. In this paper we define some new types of
vertical forms with respect to the Liouville foliation on TM^0. We define a
cohomology group of TM^0 using these new forms. We prove a de Rham type
theorem.
