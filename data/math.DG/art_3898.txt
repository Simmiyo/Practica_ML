Volume growth, eigenvalue and compactness for self-shrinkers
In this paper, we show an optimal volume growth for self-shrinkers, and
estimate a lower bound of the first eigenvalue of $\mathcal{L}$ operator on
self-shrinkers, inspired by the first eigenvalue conjecture on minimal
hypersurfaces in the unit sphere by Yau \cite{SY}. By the eigenvalue estimates,
we can prove a compactness theorem on a class of compact self-shrinkers in
$\ir{3}$ obtained by Colding-Minicozzi under weaker conditions.
