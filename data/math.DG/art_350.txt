Sextactic points on a simple closed curve
We give optimal lower bounds for the number of sextactic points on a simple
closed curve in the real projective plane. Sextactic points are after
inflection points the simplest projectively invariant singularities on such
curves. Our method is axiomatic and can be applied in other situations.
