Singularity theorems and the Lorentzian splitting theorem for the
  Bakry-Emery-Ricci tensor
We consider the Hawking-Penrose singularity theorems and the Lorentzian
splitting theorem under the weaker curvature condition of nonnegative
Bakry-Emery-Ricci curvature $Ric_f^m$ in timelike directions. We prove that
they still hold when $m$ is finite, and when $m$ is infinite, they hold under
the additional assumption that $f$ is bounded from above.
