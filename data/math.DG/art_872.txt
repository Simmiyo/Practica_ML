Ricci-corrected derivatives and invariant differential operators
We introduce the notion of Ricci-corrected differentiation in parabolic
geometry, which is a modification of covariant differentiation with better
transformation properties. This enables us to simplify the explicit formulae
for standard invariant operators given in work of Cap, Slovak and Soucek, and
at the same time extend these formulae from the context of AHS structures
(which include conformal and projective structures) to the more general class
of all parabolic structures (including CR structures).
