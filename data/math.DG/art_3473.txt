On certain surfaces in the Euclidean space ${\mathbb{E}}^3$
In the present paper we classify all surfaces in $\E^3$ with a canonical
principal direction. Examples of these type of surfaces are constructed. We
prove that the only minimal surface with a canonical principal direction in the
Euclidean space ${\mathbb{E}}^3$ is the catenoid.
