Classical Chern-Simons on manifolds with spin structure
We construct a 2+1 dimensional classical gauge theory on manifolds with spin
structure whose action is a refinement of the Atiyah-Patodi- Singer
eta-invariant for twisted Dirac operators. We investigate the properties of the
Lagrangian field theory for closed, spun 3-manifolds and compact, spun
3-manifolds with boundary where the action is interpreted as a unitary element
of a Pfaffian line of twisted Dirac operators. We then investigate the
properties of the Hamiltonian field theory over 3-manifolds of the form (R x
Y), where Y is a closed, spun 2-manifold. From the action we derive a unitary
line bundle with connection over the moduli stack of flat gauge fields on Y.
