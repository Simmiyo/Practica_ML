Samuelson's Webs
In the present paper we define Samuelson's webs and their rank. The main
result of the paper is the proof that the rank of the Samuelson webs does not
exceed 6, as well as finding the conditions under which this rank is maximal
for the general Samuelson webs as well as for their singular cases.
