Conformally flat manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature
We show that complete conformally flat manifolds of dimension n>2 with
nonnegative Ricci curvature enjoy nice rigidity properties: they are either
flat, or locally isometric to a product of a sphere and a line, or are globally
conformally equivalent to flat space or to a spherical spaceform. This extends
previous works by Q.-M. Cheng, M.H. Noronha, B.-L. Chen and X.-P. Zhu, and S.
Zhu.
