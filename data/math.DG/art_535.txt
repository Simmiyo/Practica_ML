Moduli spaces of topological calibrations, Calabi-Yau, HyperKähler,
  $G_2$ and Spin(7) structures
We shall obtain unobstructed deformations of four geometric structures:
Calabi-Yau, HyperK\"ahler, $\G$ and Spin(7) structures in terms of closed
differential forms (calibrations). We develop a direct and unified construction
of smooth moduli spaces of these four geometric structures and show that the
local Torelli type theorem holds in a systematic way.
