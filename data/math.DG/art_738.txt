The index of biharmonic maps in spheres
Biharmonic maps are the critical points of the bienergy functional and
generalise harmonic maps. We investigate the index of a class of biharmonic
maps, derived from minimal Riemannian immersions into spheres. This study is
motivated by three families of examples: the totally geodesic inclusion of
spheres, the Veronese map and the Clifford torus.
