Triviality of the dressing isotropy for a Smyth-type potential and
  nonclosing of the resulting CMC surfaces
The quantum cohomology of CP^1 is generated by some potential (Frobenius
manifold) that also has an interpretation as a potential of some harmonic map.
Actually, the potential induces harmonic maps into three different symmetric
spaces and each of these harmonic maps induces an immersion of an integrable
surface. The final goal of this paper is to investigate if any of the
associated immersions closes around the singularity at z=0 (none does). The
crucial tool for deciding this question is the main technical result of the
paper, which states that the dressing isotropy of the CP^1 potential is
trivial.
