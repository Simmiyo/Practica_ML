Constant Scalar Curvature Metrics on Connected Sums
Let (M,g) be a compact Riemannian manifold with dimension n > 2. The Yamabe
problem is to find a metric with constant scalar curvature in the conformal
class of g, by minimizing the total scalar curvature. The proof was completed
in 1984.
  Suppose (M',g') and (M'',g'') are compact Riemannian n-manifolds with
constant scalar curvature. We form the connected sum M' # M'' of M' and M'' by
removing small balls from M' and M'' and joining the S^{n-1} boundaries
together. In this paper we use analysis to construct metrics with constant
scalar curvature on M' # M''. Our description is quite explicit, in contrast to
the general Yamabe case when one knows little about what the metric looks like.
  There are 9 cases, depending on the signs of the scalar curvature on M' and
M'' (positive, negative, or zero). We show that the constant scalar curvature
metrics either develop small "necks" separating M' and M'', or one of M', M''
is crushed small by the conformal factor. When both have positive scalar
curvature, we construct three different metrics with scalar curvature 1 in the
same conformal class.
