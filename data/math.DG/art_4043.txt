On global geodesic mappings of $n$-dimensional surfaces of revolution
In this paper we study geodesic mappings of $n$-dimensional surfaces of
revolution. From the general theory of geodesic mappings of equidistant spaces
we specialize to surfaces of revolution and apply the obtained formulas to the
case of rotational ellipsoids. We prove that such $n$-dimensional ellipsoids
admit non trivial smooth geodesic deformations onto $n$-dimensional surfaces of
revolution, which are generally of a different type.
