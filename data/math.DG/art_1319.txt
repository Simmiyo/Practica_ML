Classification of cubics up to affine transformations
Classification of cubics (that is, third order planar curves in the $R^2$ up
to certain transformations is interested since Newton, and treated by several
authors. We classify cubics up to affine transformations, in seven class, and
give a complete set of representatives of the these classes. This result is
complete and briefer than the similar results.
