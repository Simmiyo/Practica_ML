A uniqueness theorem for the singly periodic genus-one helicoid
The singly periodic genus-one helicoid was in the origin of the discovery of
the first example of a complete minimal surface with finite topology but
infinite total curvature, the celebrated Hoffman-Karcher-Wei's genus one
helicoid. The objective of this paper is to give a uniqueness theorem for the
singly periodic genus-one helicoid provided the existence of one symmetry.
