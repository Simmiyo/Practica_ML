Spectrum of hypersurfaces with small extrinsic radius or large
  $λ_1$ in euclidean spaces
In this paper, we prove that Euclidean hypersurfaces with almost extremal
extrinsic radius or $\lambda_1$ have a spectrum that asymptotically contains
the spectrum of the extremal sphere in the Reilly or Hasanis-Koutroufiotis
Inequalities. We also consider almost extremal hypersurfaces which satisfy a
supplementary bound on $v_M\|\B\|_\alpha^n$ and show that their spectral and
topological properties depends on the position of $\alpha$ with respect to the
critical value $\dim M$. The study of the metric shape of these extremal
hypersurfaces will be done in \cite{AG1}, using estimates of the present paper.
