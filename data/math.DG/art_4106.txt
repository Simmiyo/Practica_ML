QR-submanifolds and Riemannian metrics with $G_2$ holonomy
In this note we prove that QR-submanifolds of the hyper-Kahler manifolds
under some conditions admit the $G_2$ holonomy. We give simplest examples of
such QR-submanifolds namely tori.
  We conjecture that all $G_2$ holonomy manifolds arise in this way.
