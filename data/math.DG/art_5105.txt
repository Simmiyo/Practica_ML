Axiomatic Differential Geometry II-3
As the fourth paper of our series of papers concerned with axiomatic
differential geometry, this paper is devoted to the general Jacobi identity
supporting the Jacobi identity of vector fields. The general Jacobi identity
can be regarded as one of the few fundamental results belonging properly to
smootheology.
