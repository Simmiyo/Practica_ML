A note on the uniqueness of solutions for the Yamabe problem
We prove that in conformal classes of metrics near the class of an Einstein
metric (other than the standard round metric on a sphere) the Yamabe problem
has a unique solution up to scaling. This is a local extension, in the space of
conformal classes, of a well-known uniqueness criterion due to Obata.
