Kaehler manifolds admitting a flat complex conformal connection
We prove that any Kaehler manifold admitting a flat complex conformal
connection is a Bochner-Kaehler manifold with special scalar distribution and
zero geometric constants. Applying the local structural theorem for such
manifolds we obtain a complete description of the Kaehler manifolds under
consideration.
