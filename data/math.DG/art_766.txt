Collapsed Riemannian manifolds with bounded sectional curvature
In the last two decades, one of the most important developments in Riemannian
geometry is the collapsing theory of Cheeger-Fukaya-Gromov. A Riemannian
manifold is called (sufficiently) collapsed if its dimension looks smaller than
its actual dimension while its sectional curvature remains bounded (say a very
thin flat torus looks like a circle in a bared eyes). We will survey the
development of collapsing theory and its applications to Riemannian geometry
since 1990. The common starting point for all of these is the existence of a
singular fibration structure on collapsed manifolds. However, new techniques
have been introduced and tools from related fields have been brought in. As a
consequence, light has been shed on some classical problems and conjectures
whose statements do not involve collapsing. Specifically, substantial progress
has been made on manifolds with nonpositive curvature, on positively pinched
manifolds, collapsed manifolds with an a priori diameter bound, and subclasses
of manifolds whose members satisfy additional topological conditions e.g.
$2$-connectedness.
