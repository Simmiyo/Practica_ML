Discrete flat surfaces and linear Weingarten surfaces in hyperbolic
  3-space
We define discrete flat surfaces in hyperbolic 3-space from the perspective
of discrete integrable systems and prove properties that justify the
definition. We show how these surfaces correspond to previously defined
discrete constant mean curvature 1 surfaces in hyperbolic 3-space, and we also
describe discrete focal surfaces (discrete caustics) that can be used to define
singularities on discrete flat surfaces. We also examine discrete linear
Weingarten surfaces of Bryant type in hyperbolic 3-space, and consider an
example of a discrete flat surface related to the Airy equation that exhibits
swallowtail singularities and a Stokes phenomenon.
