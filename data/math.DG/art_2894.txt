Geometry of Complete Gradient Shrinking Ricci Solitons
We survey some of the recent progress on complete gradient shrinking Ricci
solitons, including the classifications in dimension three and asymptotic
behavior of potential functions as well as volume growths of geodesic balls in
higher dimensions. This article is written for the conference proceedings
dedicated to Yau's 60th birthday.
