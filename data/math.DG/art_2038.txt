A method for the resolution of the Jacobi equation Y''+RY = 0 on the
  manifold Sp(2)/SU(2)
In this paper a method for the resolution of the differential equation of the
Jacobi vector fields in the manifold V1 = Sp(2)/SU(2) is exposed. These results
are applied to determine areas and volumes of geodesic spheres and balls.
