A Uniqueness Theorem for Gluing Special Lagrangian Submanifolds
Butscher, D. Lee, Y. Lee, and Joyce constructed a special Lagrangian
submanifold by gluing a Lawlor neck into a transverse intersection point of two
special Lagrangian submanifolds. We prove a uniqueness theorem for the gluing
of flat special Lagrangian tori of real dimension 3 in a flat complex torus of
complex dimension 3.
