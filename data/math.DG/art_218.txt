A remark on fixed point sets of gradient-like flows
Let $S$ be a set of critical points of a smooth real-valued function on a
closed manifold $M$. Generalizing a well-known result of
Lusternik--Schnirelmann, Reeken~[R] proved that $\cat S \geq \cat M$. Here we
prove a generalization of Reeken"s inequality for gradient-like flows on
compact spaces.
