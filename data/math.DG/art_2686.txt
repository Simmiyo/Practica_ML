Structures conformes asymptotiquement plates
In the first part of this article we revisit the theory of weighted spinors
on conformal manifolds. In the second part we introduce the notions of
asymptotically flat Weyl structures and of associated mass, and we prove a
conformal version of the positive mass theorem on conformal spin manifolds.
