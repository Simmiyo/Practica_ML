A moduli space of minimal affine Lagrangian submanifolds
It is proved that the moduli space of all connected compact orientable
embedded minimal affine Lagrangian submanifolds of a complex equiaffine space
constitutes an infinite dimensional Frechet manifold (if it is not the empty
set). The moduli space of all connected compact orientable metric Lagrangian
embedded surfaces in an almost Kaehler 4-dimensional manifold forms an infinite
dimensional Frechet manifold (if it is not the empty set).
