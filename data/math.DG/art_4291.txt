Anosov representations: Domains of discontinuity and applications
The notion of Anosov representations has been introduced by Labourie in his
study of the Hitchin component for SL(n,R). Subsequently, Anosov
representations have been studied mainly for surface groups, in particular in
the context of higher Teichmueller spaces, and for lattices in SO(1,n). In this
article we extend the notion of Anosov representations to representations of
arbitrary word hyperbolic groups and start the systematic study of their
geometric properties. In particular, given an Anosov representation of $\Gamma$
into G we explicitly construct open subsets of compact G-spaces, on which
$\Gamma$ acts properly discontinuously and with compact quotient.
  As a consequence we show that higher Teichmueller spaces parametrize locally
homogeneous geometric structures on compact manifolds. We also obtain
applications regarding (non-standard) compact Clifford-Klein forms and
compactifications of locally symmetric spaces of infinite volume.
