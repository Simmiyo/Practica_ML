The spectrum of the twisted Dirac operator on Kahler submanifolds of the
  comlex projective space
We establish an upper estimate for the small eigenvalues of the twisted Dirac
operator on Kahler submanifolds in Kahler manifolds carrying Kahlerian Killing
spinors. We then compute the spectrum of the twisted Dirac operator of the
canonical embedding \CP^d \rightarrow \CP^n in order to test the sharpness of
the upper bounds
