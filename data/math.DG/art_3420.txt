Deformations of 2k-Einstein structures
It is shown that the space of infinitesimal deformations of 2k-Einstein
structures is finite dimensional at compact non-flat space forms. Moreover,
spherical space forms are shown to be rigid in the sense that they are isolated
in the corresponding moduli space.
