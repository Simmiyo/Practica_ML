A note on totally geodesic embeddings of Eschenburg spaces into Bazaikin
  spaces
In this note it is shown that every 7-dimensional Eschenburg space can be
totally geodesically embedded into infinitely many topologically distinct
13-dimensional Bazaikin spaces. Furthermore, examples are given which show
that, under the known construction, it is not always possible to totally
geodesically embed a positively curved Eschenburg space into a Bazaikin space
with positive curvature.
