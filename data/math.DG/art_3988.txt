Biharmonic Curves in 3-dimensional Hyperbolic Heisenberg Group
In this paper we study the non-geodesic non-null biharmonic curves in
3-dimensional hyperbolic Heisenberg group. We prove that all of the
non-geodesic non-null biharmonic curves in 3-dimensional hyperbolic Heisenberg
group are helices. Moreover, we obtain explicit parametric equations for
non-geodesic non-null biharmonic curves and non-geodesic spacelike horizontal
biharmonic curves in 3-dimensional hyperbolic Heisenberg group, respectively.
We also show that there do not exist non-geodesic timelike horizontal
biharmonic curves in 3-dimensional hyperbolic Heisenberg group.
