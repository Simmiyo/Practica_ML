Curvature estimates for minimal submanifolds of higher codimension and
  small G-rank
We obtain new curvature estimates and Bernstein type results for minimal
$n-$submanifolds in $\ir{n+m},\, m\ge 2$ under the condition that the rank of
its Gauss map is at most 2. In particular, this applies to minimal surfaces in
Euclidean spaces of arbitrary codimension.
