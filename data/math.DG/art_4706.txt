Complete self-shrinkers of the mean curvature flow
It is our purpose to study complete self-shrinkers in Euclidean space. By
introducing a generalized maximum principle for $\mathcal{L}$-operator, we give
estimates on supremum and infimum of the squared norm of the second fundamental
form of self-shrinkers without assumption on \emph{polynomial volume growth},
which is assumed in Cao and Li. Thus, we can obtain the rigidity theorems on
complete self-shrinkers without assumption on \emph{polynomial volume growth}.
For complete proper self-shrinkers of dimension 2 and 3, we give a
classification of them under assumption of constant squared norm of the second
fundamental form.
