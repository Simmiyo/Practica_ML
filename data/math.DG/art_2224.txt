Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian tori contained in a hypersphere
The Clifford torus is a torus in a three-dimensional sphere. Homogeneous tori
are simple generalization of the Clifford torus which still in a
three-dimensional sphere. There is a way to construct tori in a
three-dimensional sphere using the Hopf fibration. In this paper, all
Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian tori which is contained in a hypersphere in
the complex Euclidean plane are constructed explicitly. Then it is shown that
they are homogeneous tori. For the construction, flat quaternionic connections
of Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian tori are considered and a spectral curve
of an associated family of them is used.
