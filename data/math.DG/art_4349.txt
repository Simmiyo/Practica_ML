The logarithmic entropy formula for the linear heat equation on
  Riemannian manifolds
In this paper we introduce a new logarithmic entropy functional for the
linear heat equation on complete Riemannian manifolds and prove that it is
monotone decreasing on complete Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci
curvature. Our results are simpler version, without Ricci flow, of R.-G. Ye's
recent result (arXiv:0708.2008v3). As an application, we apply the monotonicity
of the logarithmic entropy functional of heat kernels to characterize Euclidean
space.
