Gradient estimate for eigenforms of Hodge Laplacian
In this paper, we derive a gradient estimate for the linear combinations of
eigenforms of the Hodge Laplacian on a closed manifold. The estimate is given
in terms of the dimension, volume, diameter and curvature bound of the
manifold. As an application, we obtain directly a sharp estimate for the heat
kernel of the Hodge Laplacian.
