The space of Cauchy-Riemann structures on 3-D compact contact manifolds
We study the action of the group of contact diffeomorphisms on CR
deformations of compact three-dimensional CR manifolds. Using anisotropic
function spaces and an anisotropic structure on the space of contact
diffeomorphisms, we establish the existence of local transverse slices to the
action of the contact diffeomorphism group in the neighbourhood of a fixed
embeddable strongly pseudoconvex CR structure.
