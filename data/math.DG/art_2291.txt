Poisson structures and generalized Kahler structures
Let X be a compact Kahler manifold with a non-trivial holomorphic Poisson
structure. Then there exist deformations of non-trivial generalized Kahler
structures with one pure spinor on X. We prove that every Poisson submanifold
of X is a generalized Kahler submanifold with respect to the deformed
generalized Kahler structures and provide non-trivial examples of generalized
Kahler submanifolds arising as holomorphic Poisson submanifolds. We also obtain
unobstructed deformations of bi-Hermitian structures constructed from Poisson
structures.
