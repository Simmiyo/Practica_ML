Lignes de divergence pour les graphes a courbure moyenne constante
This paper is devoted to the study of convergence of sequences of solutions
to the constant mean curvature H equation. The convergence domain is defined.
The main Theorem characterizes the complement of this convergence domain: it
shows that circle arcs of curvature 2H compose this complement. We then give
results which allow us to use this theorem.
