On the geometric quantization of twisted Poisson manifolds
We study the geometric quantization process for twisted Poisson manifolds.
First, we introduce the notion of Lichnerowicz-twisted Poisson cohomology for
twisted Poisson manifolds and we use it in order to characterize their
prequantization bundles and to establish their prequantization condition. Next,
we introduce a polarization and we discuss the quantization problem. In each
step, several examples are presented.
