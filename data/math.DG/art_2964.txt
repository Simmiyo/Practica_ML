The cut loci on ellipsoids and certain Liouville manifolds
We show that some riemannian manifolds diffeomorphic to the sphere have the
property that the cut loci of general points are smoothly embedded closed disks
of codimension one. Ellipsoids with distinct axes are typical examples of such
manifolds.
