On the classification of gradient Ricci solitons
We show that the only complete shrinking gradient Ricci solitons with
vanishing Weyl tensor are quotients of the standard ones. This gives a new
proof of the Hamilton-Ivey-Perel'man classification of 3-dimensional shrinking
gradient solitons. We also prove a classification for expanding gradient Ricci
solitons with constant scalar curvature and suitably decaying Weyl tensor.
