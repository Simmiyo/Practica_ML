The cohomologies of the Iwasawa manifold and of its small deformations
We prove that, for some classes of complex nilmanifolds, the Bott-Chern
cohomology is completely determined by the Lie algebra associated to the
nilmanifold with the induced complex structure. We use these tools to compute
the Bott-Chern and Aeppli cohomologies of the Iwasawa manifold and of its small
deformations, completing the computations in arXiv:0709.3528v1 [math.AG] by M.
