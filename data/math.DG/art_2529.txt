On Locally Conformally Flat Gradient Shrinking Ricci Solitons
In this paper, we first apply an integral identity on Ricci solitons to prove
that closed locally conformally flat gradient Ricci solitons are of constant
sectional curvature. We then generalize this integral identity to complete
noncompact gradient shrinking Ricci solitons, under the conditions that the
Ricci curvature is bounded from below and the Riemannian curvature tensor has
at most exponential growth. As a consequence of this identity, we classify
complete locally conformally flat gradient shrinking Ricci solitons with Ricci
curvature bounded from below.
