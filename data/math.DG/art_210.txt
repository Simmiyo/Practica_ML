Some Remarks on the Hijazi Inequality and Generalizations of the Killing
  Equation for Spinors
We generalize the well-known lower estimates for the first eigenvalue of the
Dirac operator on a compact Riemannian spin manifold proved by Th. Friedrich
(1980) and O. Hijazi (1986, 1992). The special solutions of the Einstein-Dirac
equation constructed recently by Friedrich/Kim are examples for the limiting
case of these inequalities. The discussion of the limiting case of these
estimates yields two new field equations generalizing the Killing equation as
well as the weak Killing equation for spinor fields. Finally, we discuss the 2-
and 3-dimensional case in more detail.
