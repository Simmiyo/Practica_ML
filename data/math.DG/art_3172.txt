Degeneration of shrinking Ricci solitons
Let $(Y,d)$ be a Gromov-Hausdorff limit of closed shrinking Ricci solitons
with uniformly upper bounded diameter and lower bounded volume. We prove that
off a closed subset of codimension at least 2, $Y$ is a smooth manifold
satisfying a shrinking Ricci soliton equation.
