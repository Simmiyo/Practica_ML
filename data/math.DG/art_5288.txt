An assortment of negatively curved ends
Motivated by a recent groundbreaking work of Ontaneda, we describe a sizable
class of closed manifolds such that the product of each manifold in the class
with the real line admits a complete metric of bounded negative sectional
curvature which is an exponentially warped near one end and has finite volume
near the other end.
