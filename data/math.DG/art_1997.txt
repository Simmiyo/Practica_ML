A remark on left invariant metrics on compact Lie groups
We show that a left invariant metric on a compact Lie group $G$ which is
obtained by stretching a biinvariant metric in the direction of a subalgebra
$\h$ of $\g$ always has some negative sectional curvature, unless the
semi-simple part of $\h$ is an ideal of $\g$.
