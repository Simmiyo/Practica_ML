Conformal and Grassmann structures
The main results on the theory of conformal and almost Grassmann structures
are presented. The common properties of these structures and also the
differences between them are outlined. In particular, the structure groups of
these structures and their differential prolongations are found. A complete
system of geometric objects of the almost Grassmann structure totally defining
its geometric structure is determined. The vanishing of these objects
determines a locally Grassmann manifold. It is proved that the integrable
almost Grassmann structures are locally Grassmann. The criteria of
semiintegrability of almost Grassmann structures is proved in invariant form.
