Totally geodesic submanifolds in Riemannian symmetric spaces
In the first part of this expository article, the most important
constructions and classification results concerning totally geodesic
submanifolds in Riemannian symmetric spaces are summarized. In the second part,
I describe the results of my classification of the totally geodesic
submanifolds in the Riemannian symmetric spaces of rank 2.
