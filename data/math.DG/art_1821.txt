Weakly reflective submanifolds and austere submanifolds
We introduce the notion of a weakly reflective submanifold, which is an
austere submanifold with a certain global condition, and study its fundamental
properties. Using these, we determine weakly reflective orbits and austere
orbits of s-representations.
