Almost homogeneous manifolds with boundary
Let $\rho_0$ be an action of a Lie group on a manifold with boundary that is
transitive on the interior. We study the set of actions that are topologically
conjugate to $\rho_0$, up to smooth or analytic change of coordinates. We show
that in many cases, including the compactifications of negatively curved
symmetric spaces, this set is infinite.
