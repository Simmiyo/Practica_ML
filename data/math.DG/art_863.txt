Manifolds which are Ivanov-Petrova or k-Stanilov
We present some examples of curvature homogeneous pseudo-Riemannian manifolds
which are k-spacelike Jordan Stanilov; their higher order curvature operator
has constant Jordan normal form on the Grassmannian of unoriented k-dimensional
spacelike subspaces of the tangent plane.
