Geometry of Certain Lie-Frobenius Groups
We study the geometry of a family of Lie groups, which contained the
classical affine Lie groups, endowed with an exact left invariant symplectic
form. We show that this family is closed by symplectic reduction and symplectic
double extension in the sense of Dardi\'{e} and Medina. We prouve also that
these groups are endowed with two transverse left invariant Lagrangian (resp.
Symplectic) foliations. This implies that these groups admit a left invariant
torsion free symplectic connection.
