Around Vogt's theorem
Vogt's theorem, concerning boundary angles of a convex arc with monotonic
curvature (spiral arc), is taken as a starting point to establish basic
properties of spirals. The theorem is expanded by removing requirements of
convexity and curvature continuity; the cases of inflection and multiple
windings are considered. Positional restrictions for a spiral arc with two
given curvature elements at the endpoints are established, as well as the
necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such spiral.
