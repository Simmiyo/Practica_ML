Szasz Analytic Functions and Noncompact Kähler Toric Manifolds
We show that the classical Szasz analytic function $S_N(f)(x)$ is obtained by
applying the pseudo-differential operator $f(N^{-1}D_{\theta})$ to the Bergman
kernels for the Bargmann-Fock space. The expression generalizes immediately to
any smooth polarized noncompact complete toric \kahler manifold, defining the
generalized Szasz analytic function $S_{h^N}(f)(x)$. About $S_{h^N}(f)(x)$, we
prove that it admits complete asymptotics and there exists a universal scaling
limit. % We also consider some dilation operator composed with $S_{h^N}(f)(x)$
and we give an estimate about this composition. As an example, we will further
compute $S_{h^N}(f)(x)$ for the Bergman metric on the unit ball.
