The mean curvature flow for equifocal submanifolds
In this paper, we investigate the mean curvature flow having equifocal
submanifolds as initial data. The investigation are performed by investigating
the mean curvature flow having the lifted submanifolds to a Hilbert space
through a Riemannian submersion as initial data.
