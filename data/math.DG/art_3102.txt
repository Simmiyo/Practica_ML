Profiles of inflated surfaces
We study the shape of inflated surfaces introduced in \cite{B1} and
\cite{P1}. More precisely, we analyze profiles of surfaces obtained by
inflating a convex polyhedron, or more generally an almost everywhere flat
surface, with a symmetry plane. We show that such profiles are in a
one-parameter family of curves which we describe explicitly as the solutions of
a certain differential equation.
