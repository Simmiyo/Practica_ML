Weak Mirror Symmetry of Complex Symplectic Algebras
A complex symplectic structure on a Lie algebra $\lie h$ is an integrable
complex structure $J$ with a closed non-degenerate $(2,0)$-form. It is
determined by $J$ and the real part $\Omega$ of the $(2,0)$-form. Suppose that
$\lie h$ is a semi-direct product $\lie g\ltimes V$, and both $\lie g$ and $V$
are Lagrangian with respect to $\Omega$ and totally real with respect to $J$.
This note shows that $\lie g\ltimes V$ is its own weak mirror image in the
sense that the associated differential Gerstenhaber algebras controlling the
extended deformations of $\Omega$ and $J$ are isomorphic. The geometry of
$(\Omega, J)$ on the semi-direct product $\lie g\ltimes V$ is also shown to be
equivalent to that of a torsion-free flat symplectic connection on the Lie
algebra $\lie g$. By further exploring a relation between $(J, \Omega)$ with
hypersymplectic algebras, we find an inductive process to build families of
complex symplectic algebras of dimension $8n$ from the data of the
$4n$-dimensional ones.
