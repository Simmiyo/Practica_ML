Walker's theorem without coordinates
We provide a coordinate-free version of the local classification, due to A.
G. Walker [Quart. J. Math. Oxford (2) 1, 69 (1950)], of null parallel
distributions on pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. The underlying manifold is
realized, locally, as the total space of a fibre bundle, each fibre of which is
an affine principal bundle over a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. All structures
just named are naturally determined by the distribution and the metric, in
contrast with the non-canonical choice of coordinates in the usual formulation
of Walker's theorem.
