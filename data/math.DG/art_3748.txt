The K-energy on small deformations of constant scalar curvature Kahler
  manifolds
In this note we give a simplified proof of a recent result of X.X. Chen,
which together with work of G. Szekelyhidi implies that on a sufficiently small
deformation of a polarized constant scalar curvature Kahler manifold the
K-energy has a lower bound.
