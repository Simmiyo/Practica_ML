Some generalizations of the notion of Lie algebra
We introduce the notion of left (and right) quasi-Loday algebroids and a
"universal space" for them, called a left (right) omni-Loday algebroid, in such
a way that Lie algebroids, omni-Lie algebras and omni-Loday algebroids are
particular substructures.
