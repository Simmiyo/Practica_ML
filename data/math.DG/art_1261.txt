Homogeneous quaternionic Kaehler structures and quaternionic hyperbolic
  space
An explicit classification of homogeneous quaternionic Kaehler structures by
real tensors is derived and we relate this to the representation-theoretic
description found by Fino. We then show how the quaternionic hyperbolic space
HH(n) is characterised by admitting homogeneous structures of a particularly
simple type. In the process we study the properties of different homogeneous
models for HH(n).
