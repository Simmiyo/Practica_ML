Collars and partitions of hyperbolic cone-surfaces
For compact Riemann surfaces, the collar theorem and Bers' partition theorem
are major tools for working with simple closed geodesics. The main goal of this
paper is to prove similar theorems for hyperbolic cone-surfaces. Hyperbolic
two-dimensional orbifolds are a particular case of such surfaces. We consider
all cone angles to be strictly less than $\pi$ to be able to consider
partitions.
