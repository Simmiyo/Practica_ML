Spacelike Jordan Osserman algebraic curvature tensors in the higher
  signature setting
Let $R$ be an algebraic curvature tensor on a vector space of signature
$(p,q)$ defining a spacelike Jordan Osserman Jacobi operator $\JJ_R$. We show
that the eigenvalues of $\JJ_R$ are real and that $\JJ_R$ is diagonalizable if
$p<q$.
