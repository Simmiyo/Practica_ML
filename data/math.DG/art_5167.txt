On an inequality of Andrews, De Lellis and Topping
Using the method of De Lellis-Topping, we prove some almost Schur type
results. For example, one of our results gives a quantitative measure of how
close the higher mean curvature of a submanifold is to its average value. We
also derive another sharp Andrews-De Lellis-Topping type inequality involving
the Riemannian curvature tensor and discuss its equality case.
