Construction of Complete Embedded Self-Similar Surfaces under Mean
  Curvature Flow. Part I
We carry out the first main step towards the construction of new examples of
complete embedded self-similar surfaces under mean curvature flow. An
approximate solution is obtained by taking two known examples of self-similar
surfaces and desingularizing the intersection circle using an appropriately
modified singly periodic Scherk surface, called the core. Using an inverse
function theorem, we show that for small boundary conditions on the core, there
is an embedded surface close to the core that is a solution of the equation for
self-similar surfaces. This provides us with an adequate central piece to
substitute for the intersection.
