An Example of the Curvature Tensor for a Quantum Space
The paper is constructed in two parts.In the first part we introduce the
concept of the algebra of Q-meromorphic functions on the quantum plane.The A
(q)-algebra of Q-analytic functions considered in[6]is seen as a proper
subalgebra. In the second part we find a formula for the curvature tensor on
this algebra. It is seen that when the quantization parameter tendsto 1,then
this formula gives the flatness of the usual R^2 .
