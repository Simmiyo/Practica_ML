Iterated Integrals and higher order invariants
We deduce from the work of Chen, that the restriction morphism from closed
free iterated integrals to closed iterated integrals on loops is onto. We use
this to show that the module of higher order invariants of smooth functions is
generated by free closed iterated integrals.
