Some Characterizations of Slant Helices in the Euclidean Space E^n
In this work, notion of a slant helix is extended to space E$^n$. Necessary
and sufficient conditions to be a slant helix in the Euclidean $n-$space are
presented. Moreover, we express some integral characterizations of such curves
in terms of curvature functions.
