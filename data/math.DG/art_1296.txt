Polar actions on symmetric spaces
We study isometric Lie group actions on symmetric spaces admitting a section,
i.e. a submanifold which meets all orbits orthogonally at every intersection
point. We classify such actions on the compact symmetric spaces with simple
isometry group and rank greater than one. In particular we show that these
actions are hyperpolar, i.e. the sections are flat.
