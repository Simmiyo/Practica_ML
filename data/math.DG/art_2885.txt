Fatou's Theorem and minimal graphs
In this paper we extend a recent result of Collin-Rosenberg ({\it a solution
to the minimal surface equation in the Euclidean disc has radial limits almost
everywhere}) to a large class of differential operators in Divergence form.
Moreover, we construct an example (in the spirit of \cite{CR2}) of a minimal
graph in $\mr$, where $\m$ is a Hadamard surface, over a geodesic disc which
has finite radial limits in a mesure zero set.
