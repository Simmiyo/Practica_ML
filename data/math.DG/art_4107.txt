Examples of naturally reductive pseudo-Riemannian Lie groups
We provide examples of naturally reductive pseudo-Riemannian spaces, in
particular an example of a naturally reductive pseudo-Riemannian 2-step
nilpotent Lie group $(N, < \,,\,>_N)$, such that $< \,,\,>_N$ is invariant
under a left action and for which the center is degenerate. The metric does not
correspond to a bi-invariant one.
