Some examples of special Lagrangian tori
I point out some very elementary examples of special Lagrangian tori in
certain Calabi-Yau manifolds that occur as hypersurfaces in complex projective
space. All of these are constructed as real slices of smooth hypersurfaces
defined over the reals. This method of constructing special Lagrangian
submanifolds is well known. What does not appear to be in the current
literature is an explicit description of such examples in which the special
Lagrangian submanifold is a 3-torus.
