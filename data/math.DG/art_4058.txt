Uniform Sobolev inequality along the Sasaki-Ricci flow
We prove a uniform Sobolev inequality along the Sasaki-Ricci flow. In the
process, we develop the theory of basic Lebesgue and Sobolev function spaces,
and prove some general results about the decomposition of the heat kernel for a
class of elliptic operators on a Sasaki manifold.
