The Dirac spectrum on manifolds with gradient conformal vector fields
We show that the Dirac operator on a spin manifold does not admit $L^2$
eigenspinors provided the metric has a certain asymptotic behaviour and is a
warped product near infinity. These conditions on the metric are fulfilled in
particular if the manifold is complete and carries a non-complete vector field
which outside a compact set is gradient conformal and non-vanishing.
