Relative isoperimetric inequalities for Lagrangian disks
We prove a relative isoperimetric inequalities for Lagrangian half disks in
$\mathbb{C}^2$ with respect to a Lagrangian plane, or a complex plane, or a
union of any two of Lagrangian or complex planes that intersect transversally
at the origin.
