Subspaces of a para-quaternionic Hermitian vector space
Let $(\tilde Q,g) $ be a para-quaternionic Hermitian structure on the real
vector space $V$. By referring to the tensorial presentation $(V, \tilde{Q},g)
\simeq (H^2 \otimes E^{2n}, \mathfrak{sl}(H),\omega^H \otimes \omega^E)$, we
give an explicit description, from an affine and metric point of view, of main
classes of subspaces of $V$ which are invariantly defined with respect to the
structure group of $\tilde{Q}$ and $(\tilde{Q},g)$ respectively.
