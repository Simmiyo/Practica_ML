Ricci Curvature Rigidity for Weakly Asymptotically Hyperbolic Manifolds
A rigidity result for weakly asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds with lower
bounds on Ricci curvature is proved without assuming that the manifolds are
spin. The argument makes use of a quasi-local mass characterization of
Euclidean balls from \cite{Miao} \cite{S_T} and eigenfunction compactification
ideas from \cite{Qing}.
