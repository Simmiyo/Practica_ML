Triply periodic minimal surfaces which converge to the
  Hoffman-Wohlgemuth example
We get a continuous one-parameter new family of embedded minimal surfaces, of
which the period problems are two-dimensional. Moreover, one proves that it has
Scherk second surface and Hoffman-Wohlgemuth example as limit-members.
