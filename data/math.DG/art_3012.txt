Ruled minimal surfaces in the three dimensional Heisenberg group
It is shown that parts of planes, helicoids and hyperbolic paraboloids are
the only minimal surfaces ruled by geodesics in the three dimensional
Riemannian Heisenberg group. It is also shown that they are the only surfaces
in the three dimensional Heisenberg group whose mean curvature is zero with
respect to both of the standard Riemannian metric and the standard Lorentzian
metric.
