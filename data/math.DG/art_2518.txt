Convex functions on Grassmannian manifolds and Lawson-Osserman problem
We derive estimates of the Hessian of two smooth functions defined on
Grassmannian manifold. Based on it, we can derive curvature estimates for
minimal submanifolds in Euclidean space via Gauss map. In this way, the result
for Bernstein type theorem done by Jost and the first author could be improved.
