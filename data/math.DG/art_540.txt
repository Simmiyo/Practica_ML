Volume preserving embeddings of open subsets of $R^n$ into manifolds
We consider a connected smooth $n$-dimensional manifold $M$ endowed with a
volume form $\Omega$, and we show that an open subset $U$ of $R^n$ of Lebesgue
measure $\Vol (U)$ embeds into $M$ by a smooth volume preserving embedding
whenever the volume condition $\Vol (U) \le \Vol (M,\Omega)$ is met.
