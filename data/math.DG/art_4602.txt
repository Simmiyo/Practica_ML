The deformations of flat affine structures on the two-torus
The group action which defines the moduli problem for the deformation space
of flat affine structures on the two-torus is the action of the affine group
$\Aff(2)$ on $\bbR^2$. Since this action has non-compact stabiliser
$\GL(2,\bbR)$, the underlying locally homogeneous geometry is highly
non-Riemannian. In this article, we describe the deformation space of all flat
affine structures on the two-torus. In this context interesting phenomena arise
in the topology of the deformation space, which, for example, is \emph{not} a
Hausdorff space. This contrasts with the case of constant curvature metrics, or
conformal structures on surfaces, which are encountered in classical
Teichm\"uller theory. As our main result on the space of deformations of flat
affine structures on the two-torus we prove that the holonomy map from the
deformation space to the variety of conjugacy classes of homomorphisms from the
fundamental group of the two-torus to the affine group is a local
homeomorphism.
