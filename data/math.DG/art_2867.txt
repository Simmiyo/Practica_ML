On Sasaki-Einstein manifolds in dimension five
We prove the existence of Sasaki-Einstein metrics on certain simply connected
5-manifolds where until now existence was unknown. All of these manifolds have
non-trivial torsion classes. On several of these we show that there are a
countable infinity of deformation classes of Sasaki-Einstein structures.
