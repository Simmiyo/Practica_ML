Geodesics in infinite dimensional Stiefel and Grassmann manifolds
Let $V$ be a separable Hilbert space, possibly infinite dimensional. Let
$\St(p,V)$ be the Stiefel manifold of orthonormal frames of $p$ vectors in $V$,
and let $\Gr(p,V)$ be the Grassmann manifold of $p$ dimensional subspaces of
$V$. We study the distance and the geodesics in these manifolds, by reducing
the matter to the finite dimensional case. We then prove that any two points in
those manifolds can be connected by a minimal geodesic, and characterize the
cut locus.
