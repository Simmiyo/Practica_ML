A Note on 3-quasi-Sasakian Geometry
3-quasi-Sasakian manifolds were recently studied by the authors as a suitable
setting unifying 3-Sasakian and 3-cosymplectic geometries. In this paper some
geometric properties of this class of almost 3-contact metric manifolds are
briefly reviewed, with an emphasis on those more related to physical
applications.
