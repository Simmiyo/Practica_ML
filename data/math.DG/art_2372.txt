Rigidity of compact Riemannian spin Manifolds with Boundary
In this article, we prove new rigidity results for compact Riemannian spin
manifolds with boundary whose scalar curvature is bounded from below by a
non-positive constant. In particular, we obtain generalizations of a result of
Hang-Wang \cite{hangwang1} based on a conjecture of Schroeder and Strake
\cite{schroeder}.
