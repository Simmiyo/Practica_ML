Hyperbolic rank and subexponential corank of metric spaces
We introduce a new quasi-isometry invariant $\subcorank X$ of a metric space
$X$ called {\it subexponential corank}. A metric space $X$ has subexponential
corank $k$ if roughly speaking there exists a continuous map $g:X\to T$ such
that for each $t\in T$ the set $g^{-1}(t)$ has subexponential growth rate in
$X$ and the topological dimension $\dim T=k$ is minimal among all such maps.
Our main result is the inequality $\hyprank X\le\subcorank X$ for a large class
of metric spaces $X$ including all locally compact Hadamard spaces, where
$\hyprank X$ is maximal topological dimension of $\di Y$ among all $\CAT(-1)$
spaces $Y$ quasi-isometrically embedded into $X$ (the notion introduced by M.
Gromov in a slightly stronger form). This proves several properties of
$\hyprank$ conjectured by M. Gromov, in particular, that any Riemannian
symmetric space $X$ of noncompact type possesses no quasi-isometric embedding
$\hyp^n\to X$ of the standard hyperbolic space $\hyp^n$ with $n-1>\dim X-\rank
X$.
