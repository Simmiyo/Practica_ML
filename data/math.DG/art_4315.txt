Classification of Hypersurfaces with Two Distinct Principal Curvatures
  and Closed Moebius Form in $\mathbb{S}^{m+1}$
Let $x$ be an $m$-dimensional umbilic-free hypersurface in an
$(m+1)$-dimensional unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^{m+1}(m\geq3)$. One of important
questions is to classify hypersurfaces with two distinct principal curvatures.
In this paper, we classify and explicitly express the hypersurfaces with two
distinct principal curvatures and closed Moebius form, and then we characterize
and classify conformally flat hypersurfaces of dimension larger than 3.
