Nilradicals of Einstein solvmanifolds
A Riemannian Einstein solvmanifold is called standard, if the orthogonal
complement to the nilradical of its Lie algebra is abelian. No examples of
nonstandard solvmanifolds are known. We show that the standardness of an
Einstein metric solvable Lie algebra is completely detected by its nilradical
and prove that many classes of nilpotent Lie algebras (Einstein nilradicals,
algebras with less than four generators, free Lie algebras, some classes of
two-step nilpotent ones) contain no nilradicals of nonstandard Einstein metric
solvable Lie algebras. We also prove that there are no nonstandard Einstein
metric solvable Lie algebras of dimension less than ten.
