The Space of Integrable Dirac Structures on Hilbert C*-Modules
In this paper we interpret the integrability of the Dirac structures on some
Hilbert C*-modules in terms of an automorphism group. This is the group of
orthogonal transformations on the Hilbert C*-module of sections of a Hermitian
vector bundle over an smooth manifold M. Some topological properties of the
group of integrable Dirac structures are studied. In some special cases it is
shown that the integrability condition corresponds to the solutions of a
partial differential equation. This is explained as a necessary and sufficient
condition.
