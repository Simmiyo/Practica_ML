A Hadwiger-type theorem for the special unitary group
The dimension of the space of SU(n) and translation invariant continuous
valuations on $\mathbb{C}^n, n \geq 2$ is computed. For even $n$, this
dimension equals $(n^2+3n+10)/2$; for odd $n$ it equals $(n^2+3n+6)/2$. An
explicit geometric basis of this space is constructed. The kinematic formulas
for SU(n) are obtained as corollaries.
