Szabo Osserman IP Pseudo-Riemannian manifolds
We construct a family of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds so that the
skew-symmetric curvature operator, the Jacobi operator, and the Szabo operator
have constant eigenvalues on their domains of definition. This provides new and
non-trivial examples of Osserman, Szabo, and IP manifolds. We also study when
the associated Jordan normal form of these operators is constant.
