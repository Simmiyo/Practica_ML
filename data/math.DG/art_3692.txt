Almost Kähler manifolds of constant antiholomorphic sectional
  curvature
It is proved that if an AK2-manifold of dimension greater or equal to 6 is of
pointwise constant antiholomorphic sectional curvature, then it is a
6-dimensional manifold of constant negative sectional curvature or a K\"ahler
manifold of constant holomorphic sectional curvature.
