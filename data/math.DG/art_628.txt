Singularities of codimension two mean curvature flow of symplectic
  surfaces
We prove that for a mean curvature flow of a compact symplectic surface in a
compact Kaehler-Einstein surface, the tangent cone at the first blow-up time
consists of a finite union of more than two 2-planes in $R^4$ which are complex
in a complex structure on $R^4$.
