Surfaces of revolution in the Heisenberg group and the spectral
  generalization of the Willmore functional
We study the generalization of the Willmore functional for surfaces in the
three-Heisenberg group. Its construction is based on the spectral theory of the
Dirac operator coming to the Weierstrass representation of surfaces (see
math.DG/0503707). By using surfaces of revolution we demonstrate that it
resembles the Willmore functional for surfaces in the Euclidean space in many
geometrical respects. We also observe the relation of these functionals to the
isoperimetric problem.
