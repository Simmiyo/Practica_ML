Construction of homogeneous Lagrangian submanifolds in $\CP^n$ and
  Hamiltonian stability
We apply the concept of castling transform of prehomogeneous vector spaces to
produce new examples of minimal homogeneous Lagrangian submanifolds in the
complex projective space. Furthermore we verify the Hamiltonian stability of a
low dimensional example that can be obtained in this way.
