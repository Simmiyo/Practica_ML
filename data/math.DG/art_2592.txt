The Bäcklund transforms of Peterson's deformations of quadrics
In trying to provide explicit deformations of quadrics the starting point of
our investigation is to use Bianchi's link between real deformations of totally
real regions of real paraboloids and various totally real forms of the
sine-Gordon equation coupled with Bianchi's simple observation that the vacuum
soliton of these totally real forms of the sine-Gordon equation provides
precisely Peterson's deformations of such quadrics in order to derive explicit
B\"{a}cklund transforms of Peterson's deformations of quadrics. Based also on
Bianchi's approach of the B\"{a}cklund transformation for quadrics via common
conjugate systems and in analogy to the solitons of the sine-Gordon equation
corresponding at the level of the geometric picture to the solitons of the
pseudo-sphere we propose a model for the solitons of quadrics.
