Chern-Simons forms for R-linear connections on Lie algebroids
The Chern-Simons forms for R-linear connections on Lie algebroids are
considered. A generalized Chern-Simons formula for such R-linear connections is
obtained. We it apply to define Chern character and secondary characteristic
classes for R-linear connections of Lie algebroids.
