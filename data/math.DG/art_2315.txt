Rigidity of Conformally Compact Manifolds with the Round Sphere as the
  Conformal Infinity
In this paper we prove that under a lower bound on the Ricci curvature and an
asymptotic assumption on the scalar curvature, a complete conformally compact
manifold $(M^{n+1},g)$, with a pole $p$ and with the conformal infinity in the
conformal class of the round sphere, has to be the hyperbolic space.
