Deformations of surfaces preserving conformal or similarity invariants
In this paper we study Moebius applicable surfaces, i.e., conformally
immersed surfaces in Moebius 3-space which admit deformations preserving the
Moebius metric.
  We show new characterizations of Willmore surfaces, Bonnet surfaces and
Harmonic inverse mean curvature surfaces in terms of Moebius or similarity
invariants.
