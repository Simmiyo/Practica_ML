Holomorphic quadratic differentials and the Bernstein problem in
  Heisenberg space
We classify the entire minimal vertical graphs in the 3 dimensional
Heisenberg group Nil endowed with a Riemannian left-invariant metric. This
classification, which provides a solution to the Bernstein problem in Nil, is
given in terms of the Abresch-Rosenberg holomorphic differential for minimal
surfaces in Nil.
