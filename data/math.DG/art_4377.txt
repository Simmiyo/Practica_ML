A Note on Wu-Zheng's Splitting Conjecture
Cao's splitting theorem says that for any complete K\"ahler-Ricci flow
$(M,g(t))$ with $t\in [0,T)$, $M$ simply connected and nonnegative bounded
holomorphic bisectional curvature, $(M,g(t))$ is holomorphically isometric to
$\C^k\times (N,h(t))$ where $(N,h(t))$ is a Kahler-Ricci flow with positive
Ricci curvature for $t>0$. In this article, we show that $k=n-r$ where $r$ is
the Ricci rank of the initial metric. As a corollary, we also confirm a
splitting conjecture of Wu-Zheng when curvature is assumed to be bounded.
