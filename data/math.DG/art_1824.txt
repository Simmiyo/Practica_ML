Riemann-Roch for real varieties
If E is a C^\infty complex vector bundle on an oriented C^\infty manifold
\Sigma, diffeomorphic to a circle, then the space of sections of E has a
canonical polarization in the sense of Pressley and Segal and so one has its
determinantal gerbe with lien C^*, the group of nonzero complex numbers.
  If q:\Sigma-->B is a smooth family of circles as above and E is a vector
bundle on \Sigma, then the smooth direct image q_*(E) is an
infinite-dimensional bundle with fibers as above and so we have its
determinantal gerbe on B with lien being the sheaf of invertible complex valued
C^\infty functions, it gives a class in H^3(B, Z).
  In this paper we consider a family q:\Sigma-->B as above but with fibers
being compact oriented C^\infty manifolds of dimension d. For a bundle E on
\Sigma one expects q_*(E) to possess a determinantal d-gerbe and hence to give
a class in H^{d+2}(B, Z). We construct directly, by means of a version of the
Chern-Weil theory, the real version of this would be class. We further prove a
real version of the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem describing this class as
a direct image of a certain characteristic class of E.
