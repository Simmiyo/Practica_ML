Harmonic sections of Riemannian vector bundles, and metrics of
  Cheeger-Gromoll type
We study harmonic sections of a Riemannian vector bundle whose total space is
equipped with a 2-parameter family of metrics which includes both the Sasaki
and Cheeger-Gromoll metrics. This enables the theory of harmonic unit sections
to be extended to bundles with non-zero Euler class.
