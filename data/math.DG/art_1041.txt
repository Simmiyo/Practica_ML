Feuilletages totalement geodesiques, flots riemanniens et varietes de
  Seifert
We study totally geodesic codimension 1 smooth foliations on Lorentzian
manifold. We are in particular interested by the relations between riemannian
flows and geodesic foliations. We prove that, up to a 2-cover, any Seifert
bundle admit such a foliation.
