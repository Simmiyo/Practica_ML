The 1-jet Generalized Lagrange Geometry induced by the rheonomic Chernov
  metric
The aim of this paper is to develop on the 1-jet space J^1(R,M^4) the jet
Generalized Lagrange Geometry for the rheonomic Chernov metric. The associated
gravitational and electromagnetic field models based on the rheonomic Finsler
Chernov metric tensor are developed and discussed.
