Holomorphic vector fields and perturbed extremal Kähler metrics
We prove a theorem which asserts that the Lie algebra of all holomorphic
vector fields on a compact K\"ahler manifold with a perturbed extremal metric
has the structure similar to the case of an unperturbed extremal K\"ahler
metric proved by Calabi.
