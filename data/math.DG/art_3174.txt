New special curves and their spherical indicatrices
In this paper, we define a new special curve in Euclidean 3-space which we
call {\it $k-$slant helix} and introduce some characterizations for this curve.
This notation is generalization of a general helix and slant helix.
Furthermore, we have given some necessary and sufficient conditions for the
$k-$slant helix.
