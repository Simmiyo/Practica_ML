Globally Hyperbolic Lorentzian Manifolds with Special Holonomy Groups
We prove that each special Lorentzian holonomy group (with the exception of
those including the isotropy groups of K\"ahler symmetric spaces with rank
greater than one) can be realized as the holonomy group of a globally
hyperbolic Lorentzian manifold.
