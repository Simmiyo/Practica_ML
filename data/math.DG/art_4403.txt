Rigidity for Odd-Dimensional Souls
We prove a new rigidity result for an open manifold M with nonnegative
sectional curvature whose soul S is odd-dimensional. Specifically, there exists
a geodesic in S and a parallel vertical plane field along it with constant
vertical curvature and vanishing normal curvature. Under the added assumption
that the Sharafutdinov fibers are rotationally symmetric, this implies that for
small r, the distance sphere of radius r about S contains an immersed flat
cylinder, and thus could not have positive curvature.
