On the Margulis constant for Kleinian groups, I curvature
The Margulis constant for Kleinian groups is the smallest constant $c$ such
that for each discrete group $G$ and each point $x$ in the upper half space
${\bold H}^3$, the group generated by the elements in $G$ which move $x$ less
than distance c is elementary. We take a first step towards determining this
constant by proving that if $\langle f,g \rangle$ is nonelementary and discrete
with $f$ parabolic or elliptic of order $n \geq 3$, then every point $x$ in
${\bold H}^3$ is moved at least distance $c$ by $f$ or $g$ where
$c=.1829\ldots$. This bound is sharp.
