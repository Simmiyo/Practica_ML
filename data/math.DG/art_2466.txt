On the moduli space of Donaldson-Thomas instantons
In alignment with a programme by Donaldson and Thomas [DT], Thomas [Th]
constructed a deformation invariant for smooth projective Calabi-Yau
threefolds, which is now called the Donaldson-Thomas invariant, from the moduli
space of (semi-)stable sheaves by using algebraic geometry techniques. In the
same paper [Th], Thomas noted that certain perturbed Hermitian-Einstein
equations might possibly produce an analytic theory of the invariant. This
article sets up the equations on symplectic 6-manifolds, and gives the local
model and structures of the moduli space coming from the equations. We then
describe a Hitchin-Kobayashi style correspondence for the equations on compact
K\"ahler threefolds, which turns out to be a special case of results by
Alvarez-Consul and Garcia-Prada [AG].
