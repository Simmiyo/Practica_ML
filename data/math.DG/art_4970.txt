On the contact equivalence problem of second order ODEs which are
  quadratic with respect to the second order derivative
In the present paper we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for
two ordinary differential equations of the form $y"{}^2+A(x,y,y')
y"+B(x,y,y')=0$ to be equivalent under the action of the pseudogroup of contact
transformations. These conditions are formulated in terms of integrals of some
one-dimensional distributions.
