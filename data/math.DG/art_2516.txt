Orbifolds as stacks?
The first goal of this survey paper is to argue that if orbifolds are
groupoids, then the collection of orbifolds and their maps has to be thought of
as a 2-category. Compare this with the classical definition of Satake and
Thurston of orbifolds as a 1-category of sets with extra structure and/or with
the "modern" definition of orbifolds as proper etale Lie groupoids up to Morita
equivalence.
  The second goal is to describe two complementary ways of thinking of
orbifolds as a 2-category:
  1. the weak 2-category of foliation Lie groupoids, bibundles and equivariant
maps between bibundles and
  2. the strict 2-category of Deligne-Mumford stacks over the category of
smooth manifolds.
