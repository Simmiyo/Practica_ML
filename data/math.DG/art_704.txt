Flat fronts in hyperbolic 3-space
We shall investigate flat surfaces in hyperbolic 3-space with admissible
singularities, called `flat fronts'. An Osserman-type inequality for complete
flat fronts is shown. When equality holds in this inequality, we show that all
the ends are embedded. Moreover, we shall give new examples for which equality
holds.
