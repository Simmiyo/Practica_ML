A note on the coincidence of the projective and conformal Weyl tensors
This article examines the coincidence of the projective and conformal Weyl
tensors associated to a given connection D. The connection may be a general
Weyl connection associated to a conformal class of metrics [g]. The main result
for n>3 is that the Weyl tensors coincide iff D is the Levi-Civita connection
of an Einstein metric.
