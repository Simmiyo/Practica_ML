Curvature of almost quaternion-Hermitian manifolds
We study the decomposition of the Riemannian curvature R tensor of an almost
quaternion-Hermitian manifold under the action of its structure group
Sp(n)Sp(1). Using the minimal connection, we show that most components are
determined by the intrinsic torsion \xi and its covariant derivative
\widetilde\nabla\xi and determine relations between the decompositions of
\xi\otimes\xi, \widetilde\nabla\xi and R. We pay particular attention to the
behaviour of the Ricci curvature and the q-Ricci curvature.
