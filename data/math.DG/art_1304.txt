Lower bounds on the Calabi functional
The main result of this paper shows that "test configurations" give new lower
bounds on the $L^{2}$ norm of the scalar curvature on a Kahler manifold. This
is closely analogous to the analysis of the Yang-Mills functional over Riemann
surfaces by Atiyah and Bott. The proof uses asymptotic approximation by
finite-dimensional problems: the essential ingredient being the
Tian-Zelditch-Lu expansion of the "density of states" function.
