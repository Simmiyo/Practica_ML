Four-dimensional almost Hermitian manifolds with vanishing
  Tricerri-Vanhecke Bochner curvature tensor
We study curvature properties of four-dimensional almost Hermitian manifolds
with vanishing Bochner curvature tensor as defined by Tricerri and Vanhecke. We
give local structure theorems for such Kaehler manifolds, and find out several
examples related to the theorems.
