Non-periodic Riemann examples with handles
We show the existence of 1-parameter families of non-periodic, complete,
embedded minimal surfaces in euclidean space with infinitely many parallel
planar ends. In particular we are able to produce finite genus examples and
quasi-periodic examples of infinite genus.
