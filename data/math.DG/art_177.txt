Twistorial constructions of spacelike surfaces in Lorentzian 4-manifolds
We investigate the twistor space and the Grassmannian fibre bundle of a
Lorentzian 4-space with natural almost optical structures and its induced
CR-structures. The twistor spaces of the Lorentzian space forms $\R^4_1,
\Di{S}^4_1$ and $\Di{H}^4_1$ are explicitly discussed. The given twistor
construction is applied to surface theory in Lorentzian 4-spaces. Immersed
spacelike surfaces in a Lorentzian 4-space with special geometric properties
like semi-umbilic surfaces and surfaces that have mean curvature of vanishing
lengths correspond to holomorphic curves in the Lorentzian twistor space. For
the Lorentzian space forms $\R^4_1, \Di{S}^4_1$ and $\Di{H}^4_1$ those surfaces
are explicitly constructed and classified.
