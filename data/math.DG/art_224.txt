Bundle gerbes: stable isomorphism and local theory
We consider the notion of stable isomorphism of bundle gerbes. It has the
consequence that the stable isomorphism classes of bundle gerbes over a
manifold M are in bijective correspondence with H^3(M, Z). Stable isomorphism
sheds light on the local theory of bundle gerbes and enables us to develop a
classifying theory for bundle gerbes using results of Gajer on BC^x bundles.
