On the Geometry of the Second Fundamental Form of Translation Surfaces
  in E3
In this paper we study the second fundamental form of translation surfaces in
E3. We give a non-existence result for polynomial translation surfaces in E3
with vanishing second Gaussian curvature KII. We classify those translation
surfaces for which KII and H are proportional. Finally we obtain that there are
no II-minimal translation surfaces in the Euclidean 3-space.
