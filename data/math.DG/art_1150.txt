Curves with constant curvature ratios
Curves in ${\mathbb R}^n$ for which the ratios between two consecutive
curvatures are constant are characterized by the fact that their tangent
indicatrix is a geodesic in a flat torus. For $n= 3,4$, spherical curves of
this kind are also studied and compared with intrinsic helices in the sphere.
