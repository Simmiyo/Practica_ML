Exotic Minimal Surfaces
We prove a general fusion theorem for complete orientable minimal surfaces in
$\mathbb{R}^3$ with finite total curvature. As a consequence, complete
orientable minimal surfaces of weak finite total curvature with exotic geometry
are produced. More specifically, universal surfaces (i.e., surfaces from which
all minimal surfaces can be recovered) and space-filling surfaces with
arbitrary genus and no symmetries.
