Contact Pairs
We introduce a new geometric structure on differentiable manifolds. A
\textit{Contact} \textit{Pair}on a manifold $M$ is a pair $(\alpha,\eta) $ of
Pfaffian forms of constant classes $2k+1$ and $2h+1$ respectively such that
$\alpha\wedge d\alpha^{k}\wedge\eta\wedge d\eta^{h}$ is a volume form. Both
forms have a characteristic foliation whose leaves are contact manifolds. These
foliations are transverse and complementary. Further differential objects are
associated to Contact Pairs: two commuting Reeb vector fields, Legendrian
curves on $M$ and two Lie brackets on $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}(M) $. We give a
local model and several existence theorems on nilpotent Lie groups,
nilmanifolds, bundles over the circle and principal torus bundles.
