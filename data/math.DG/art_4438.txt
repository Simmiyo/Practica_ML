Injectivity radius bound of Ricci flow with positive Ricci curvature and
  applications
In this paper, we study the injectivity radius bound for 3-d Ricci flow. As
applications we show the long time existence of the Ricci flow with positive
Ricci curvature. We also partially settle a question in page 302 of the book of
Chow-Lu-Ni (2006).
