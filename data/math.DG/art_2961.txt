Higher genus mean curvature 1 catenoids in hyperbolic and de Sitter
  3-spaces
We show existence of constant mean curvature 1 surfaces in both hyperbolic
3-space and de Sitter 3-space with two complete embedded ends and any positive
genus up to genus twenty. We also find another such family of surfaces in de
Sitter 3-space, but with a different non-embedded end behavior.
