Equigeodesics on flag manifolds
This paper provides a characterization of homogeneous curves on a geometric
flag manifold which are geodesic with respect to any invariant metric. We call
such curves homogeneous equigeodesics. We also characterize homogeneous
equigeodesics whose associated Killing field is closed, hence, the
corresponding geodesics is closed.
