A locally symmetric Kaehler Einstein structure on a tube in the nonzero
  cotangent bundle of a space form
We obtain a locally symmetric Kaehler Einstein structure on a tube in the
nonzero cotangent bundle of a Riemannian manifold of positive constant
sectional curvature. The obtained Kaehler Einstein structure cannot have
constant holomorphic sectional curvature.
