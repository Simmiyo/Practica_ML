Mean Curvature of the Indicatrix of Finsler Manifold
Fundamental function in Finsler manifold defines a metrices that depend on a
point and a direction. At any point tangent space is a Riemannian and an
indicatrix is a convex hypersurface. In this paper a mean curvature of the
indicatrix is expressed in terms of fundamental function.
