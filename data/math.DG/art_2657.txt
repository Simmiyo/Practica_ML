Indefinite extrinsic symmetric spaces I
We find a one-to-one correspondence between full extrinsic symmetric spaces
in (possibly degenerate) inner product spaces and certain algebraic objects
called (weak) extrinsic symmetric triples. In particular, this yields a
description of arbitrary extrinsic symmetric spaces in pseudo-Euclidean spaces
by corresponding infinitesimal objects.
