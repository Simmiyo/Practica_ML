Natural connection with totally skew-symmetric torsion on almost contact
  manifolds with B-metric
A natural connection with totally skew-symmetric torsion on almost contact
manifolds with B-metric is constructed. The class of these manifolds, where the
considered connection exists, is determined. Some curvature properties for this
connection, when the corresponding curvature tensor has the properties of the
curvature tensor for the Levi-Civita connection and the torsion tensor is
parallel, are obtained.
