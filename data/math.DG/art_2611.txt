On hypercomplex pseudo-Hermitian manifolds
The class of the hypercomplex pseudo-Hermitian manifolds is considered. The
flatness of the considered manifolds with the 3 parallel complex structures is
proved. Conformal transformations of the metrics are introduced. The conformal
invariance and the conformal equivalence of the basic types manifolds are
studied. A known example is characterized in relation to the obtained results.
