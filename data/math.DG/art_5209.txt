Global isometric embeddings of multiple warped product metrics into
  quadrics
In this paper, we construct smooth isometric embeddings of multiple warped
product manifolds in quadrics of semi-Euclidean spaces. Our main theorem
generalizes previous results as given by Blanusa, Rozendorn, Henke and Azov.
