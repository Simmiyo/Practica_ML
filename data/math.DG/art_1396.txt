Transformations between surfaces in R^4 with flat normal and/or tangent
  bundles
We exhibit several transformations of surfaces in R^4. First, one that takes
a flat surface and gets a surface with flat normal bundle; then, one that takes
a surface with flat normal bundle and gets a flat surface; finally, a
one-parameter family of transformations on a flat surface with flat normal
bundle and gives a flat surface with flat normal bundle. This family satisfies
a permutability property.
