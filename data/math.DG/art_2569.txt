On Nonlinear Gauge Theories
In this note, we study non-linear gauge theories for principal bundles, where
the structure group is replaced by a Lie groupoid. We follow the approach of
Moerdijk-Mrcun and establish its relation with the existing physics literature.
In particular, we derive a new formula for the gauge transformation which
closely resembles and generalizes the classical formulas found in Yang Mills
gauge theories.
