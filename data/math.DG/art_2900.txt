Stable complete embedded minimal surfaces in $\mathbb H^1$ with empty
  characteristic locus are vertical planes
In the recent paper \cite{DGNP} we have proved that the only stable $C^2$
minimal surfaces in the first Heisenberg group $\Hn$ which are graphs over some
plane and have empty characteristic locus must be vertical planes. This result
represents a sub-Riemannian version of the celebrated theorem of Bernstein.
  In this paper we extend the result in \cite{DGNP} to $C^2$ complete embedded
minimal surfaces in $\mathbb H^1$ with empty characteristic locus. We prove
that every such a surface without boundary must be a vertical plane.
