Tangent Bundles with Sasaki Metric and Almost Hypercomplex
  Pseudo-Hermitian Structure
The tangent bundle as a $4n$-manifold is equipped with an almost hypercomplex
pseudo-Hermitian structure and it is characterized with respect to the relevant
classifications. A number of 8-dimensional examples of the considered type of
manifold are received from the known explicit examples in that manner.
