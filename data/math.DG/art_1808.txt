Hitchin-Thorpe Inequality for Noncompact Einstein 4-Manifolds
We prove a Hitchin-Thorpe inequality for noncompact Einstein 4-manifolds with
asymptotic geometry at infinity. The asymptotic geometry at infinity is either
a cusp bundle over a compact space (the fibered cusps) or a fiber bundle over a
cone with a compact fiber (the fibered boundary). Many noncompact Einstein
manifolds come with such a geometry at infinity.
