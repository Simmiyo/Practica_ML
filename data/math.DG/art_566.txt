Constructing compact manifolds with exceptional holonomy
The exceptional holonomy groups are G2 in 7 dimensions, and Spin(7) in 8
dimensions. Riemannian manifolds with these holonomy groups are Ricci-flat.
This is a survey paper on constructions for compact 7- and 8-manifolds with
holonomy G2 and Spin(7).
  The simplest such constructions work by using techniques from complex
geometry and Calabi-Yau analysis to resolve the singularities of a torus
orbifold T^7/G or T^8/G, for G a finite group preserving a flat G2 or
Spin(7)-structure on T^7 or T^8. There are also more complicated constructions
which begin with a Calabi-Yau manifold or orbifold.
  All the material in this paper is covered in much more detail in the author's
book, "Compact manifolds with special holonomy", Oxford University Press, 2000.
