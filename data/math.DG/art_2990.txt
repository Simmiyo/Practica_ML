Hamiltonian homogeneity on a complex contact manifold
The notion of c-manifolds is introduced as a generalization of complex
contact manifolds as well as the degree of symplectifications. And the
condition of infinitesimal Hamiltonian homogeneity on a c-manifold is
established by means of a moment map defined on the symplectification.
