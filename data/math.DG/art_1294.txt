Filtered ends, proper holomorphic mappings of Kahler manifolds to
  Riemann surfaces, and Kahler groups
The main goal of this paper is to prove that a connected bounded geometry
complete Kahler manifold which has at least 3 filtered ends admits a proper
holomorphic mapping onto a Riemann surface. This also provides a different
proof of the theorem of Gromov and Schoen that, for a connected compact Kahler
manifold whose fundamental group admits a proper amalgamated product
decomposition, some finite unramified cover admits a surjective holomorphic
mapping onto a curve of genus at least 2. The main results are also used to
show that any properly ascending HNN extension with finitely generated base
group, as well as Thompson's groups V, T, and F, are not Kahler. This version
contains details which will not appear in a version submitted for publication.
