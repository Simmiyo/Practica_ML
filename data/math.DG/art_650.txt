Rigidity for Nonnegatively Curved Metrics on S^2xR^3
We address the question: how large is the family of complete metrics with
nonnegative sectional curvature on S^2xR^3? We classify the connection metrics,
and give several examples of non-connection metrics. We provide evidence that
the family is small by proving some rigidity results for metrics more general
than connection metrics.
