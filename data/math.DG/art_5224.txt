Twistor space for rolling bodies
On a natural circle bundle T(M) over a 4-dimensional manifold M equipped with
a split signature metric g, whose fibers are real totally null selfdual
2-planes, we consider a tautological rank 2 distribution D obtained by lifting
each totally null plane horizontally to its point in the fiber. Over the open
set where g is not antiselfdual, the distribution D is (2,3,5) in T(M). We show
that if M is a Cartesian product of two Riemann surfaces (S1,g1) and (S2,g2),
and if g=g1--g2, then the circle bundle T(S1 x S2) is just the configuration
space for the physical system of two solid bodies B1 and B2, bounded by the
surfaces S1 and S2 and rolling on each other. The condition for the two bodies
to roll on each other `without slipping or twisting' identifies the restricted
velocity space for such a system with the tautological distribution D on T(S1 x
S2). We call T(S1 x S2) the twistor space, and D the twistor distribution for
the rolling bodies. Among others we address the following question: "For which
pairs of bodies does the restricted velocity distribution (which we identify
with the twistor distribution D) have the simple Lie group G2 as its group of
symmetries?" Apart from the well known situation when the boundaries S1 and S2
of the two bodies have constant curvatures whose ratio is 1:9, we unexpectedly
find three different types of surfaces, which when bounding a body that rolls
`without slipping or twisting' on a plane, have D with the symmetry group G2.
Although we have found the differential equations for the curvatures of S1 and
S2 that gives D with G2 symmetry, we are unable to solve them in full
generality so far.
