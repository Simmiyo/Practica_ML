3-dimensional affine hypersurfaces admitting a pointwise SO(2)- or
  Z_3-symmetry
In (equi-)affine differential geometry, the most important algebraic
invariants are the affine (Blaschke) metric h, the affine shape operator S and
the difference tensor K. A hypersurface is said to admit a pointwise symmetry
if at every point there exists a linear transformation preserving the affine
metric, the affine shape operator and the difference tensor K. The study of
submanifolds which admit pointwise isometries was initiated by Bryant
(math.DG/0007128). In this paper, we consider the 3-dimensional positive
definite hypersurfaces for which at each point the group of symmetries is
isomorphic to either Z_3 or SO(2). We classify such hypersurfaces and show how
they can be constructed starting from 2-dimensional positive definite affine
spheres.
