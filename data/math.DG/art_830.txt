On almost duality for Frobenius manifolds
We present a universal construction of almost duality for Frobenius
manifolds. The analytic setup of this construction is described in details for
the case of semisimple Frobenius manifolds. We illustrate the general
considerations by examples from the singularity theory, mirror symmetry, the
theory of Coxeter groups and Shephard groups, from the Seiberg - Witten
duality.
