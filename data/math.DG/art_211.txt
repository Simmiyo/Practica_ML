On Thom spaces, Massey products and non-formal symplectic manifolds
In this work we analyze the behavior of Massey products of closed manifolds
under the blow-up construction. The results obtained in the article are applied
to the problem of constructing closed symplectic non-formal manifolds. The
proofs use Thom spaces as an important technical tool. This application of Thom
spaces is of conceptual interest.
