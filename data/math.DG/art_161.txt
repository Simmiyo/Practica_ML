C^0-generic properties of boundary operators in Novikov Complex
One of the basic objects in the Morse theory of circle-valued maps is Novikov
complex - an analog of the Morse complex of Morse functions. Novikov complex is
defined over the ring of Laurent power series with finite negative part. The
main aim of this paper is to present a detailed and self-contained exposition
of the author's theorem saying that C^0-generically the Novikov complex is
defined over the ring of rational functions. The paper contains also a
systematic treatment of the topics of the classical Morse theory related to
Morse complexes (Chapter 2). We work with a new class of gradient-type vector
fields, which includes riemannian gradients. In Ch.3 we suggest a purely
Morse-theoretic (not using triangulations) construction of small handle
decomposition of manifolds. In the Ch.4 we deal with the gradients of Morse
functions on cobordisms. Due to the presence of critical points the descent
along the trajectories of such gradient does no define in general a continuous
map from the upper component of the boundary to the lower one. We show that for
C^0-generic gradients there is an algebraic model of "gradient descent map".
This is one of the main tools in the proof of the main theorem (Chapter 5). We
give also the generalizations of the result for the versions of Novikov complex
defined over completions of group rings (non commutative in general).
