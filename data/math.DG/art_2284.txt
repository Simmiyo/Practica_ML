Prolongations of Lie algebras and applications
We study the skew-symmetric prolongation of a Lie subalgebra $\g \subseteq
\mathfrak{so}(n)$, in other words the intersection $\Lambda^3 \cap (\Lambda^1
\otimes \g)$.We compute this space in full generality. Applications include
uniqueness results for connections with skew-symmetric torsion and also the
proof of the Euclidean version of a conjecture posed in \cite{ofarill}
concerning a class of Pl\"ucker-type embeddings. We also derive a
classification of the metric k-Lie algebras (or Filipov algebras), in positive
signature and finite dimension. Prolongations of Lie algebras can also be used
to finish the classification, started in \cite{datri}, of manifolds admitting
Killing frames, or equivalently flat connections with 3-form torsion. Next we
study specific properties of invariant 4-forms of a given metric representation
and apply these considerations to classify the holonomy representation of
metric connections with vectorial torsion, that is with torsion contained in
$\Lambda^1 \subseteq \Lambda^1 \otimes \Lambda^2$.
