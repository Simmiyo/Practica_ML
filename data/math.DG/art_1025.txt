Minimal surfaces with helicoidal ends
In this paper we describe a new deformation that connects minimal disks with
planar ends with minimal disks with helicoidal ends. In this way, we are able
to construct a family of complete minimal surfaces with helicoidal ends that
contains the singly periodic genus one helicoid of Hoffman, Karcher and Wei.
