Morphism of T*-Representations
Importance of theorem dedicated to isomorphisms consist in statement that
they allow to identify different mathematical objects which have something
common from the point of view of certain model. This paper considers morphisms
of \Ts representation of $\mathfrak{F}$\Hyph algebra and morphisms of \Ts
representation of fibered $\mathfrak{F}$\Hyph algebra.
