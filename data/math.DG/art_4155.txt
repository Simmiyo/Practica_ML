The linear trace Harnack quadratic on a steady gradient Ricci soliton
  satisfies the heat equation
We show that the linear trace Harnack quadratic on a steady gradient Ricci
soliton satisfies the heat equation. Similar result holds for shrinkers. We
also present an interpolation between Perelman's and Cao--Hamilton's Harnacks
on a steady soliton.
