On the Noncommutative Geometry of the Endomorphism Algebra of a Vector
  Bundle
In this letter we investigate some aspects of the noncommutative differential
geometry based on derivations of the algebra of endomorphisms of an oriented
complex hermitian vector bundle. We relate it, in a natural way, to the
geometry of the underlying principal bundle and compute the cohomology of its
complex of noncommutative differential forms.
