Characteristic classes for $G$-structures
Let $G\subset GL(V)$ be a linear Lie group with Lie algebra $\frak g$ and let
$A(\frak g)^G$ be the subalgebra of $G$-invariant elements of the associative
supercommutative algebra $A(\frak g)= S(\frak g^*)\otimes \La(V^*)$. To any
$G$-structure $\pi:P\to M$ with a connection $\omega$ we associate a
homomorphism $\mu_\omega:A(\frak g)^G\to \Omega(M)$. The differential forms
$\mu_\omega(f)$ for $f\in A(\frak g)^G$ which are associated to the
$G$-structure $\pi$ can be used to construct Lagrangians. If $\omega$ has no
torsion the differential forms $\mu_\omega(f)$ are closed and define
characteristic classes of a $G$-structure. The induced homomorphism
$\mu'_\omega:A(\g)^G\to H^*(M)$ does not depend on the choice of the
torsionfree connection $\omega$ and it is the natural generalization of the
Chern Weil homomorphism.
