A Generalized Maximum Principle for Yau's Square Operator, with
  Applications to the Steady State Space
We derive, for the square operator of Yau, an analogue of the Omori-Yau
maximum principle for the Laplacian. We then apply it to obtain nonexistence
results concerning complete spacelike hypersurfaces with constant higher order
mean curvature in the Steady State space.
