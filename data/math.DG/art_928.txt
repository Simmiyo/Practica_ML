Classification des varietes approximativement kahleriennes homogenes
We prove Gray & Wolf's conjecture that a Riemannian homogeneous manifold
admitting a strict nearly Kahler structure is 3-symmetric. We actually classify
them in dimension 6 and use previous results of Swann, Cleyton and Nagy to
prove the conjecture in higher dimensions.
