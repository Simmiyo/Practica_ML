Introduction to Lie groups, isometric and adjoint actions and some
  generalizations
The main purpose of these lecture notes is to provide a concise introduction
to Lie groups, Lie algebras, and isometric and adjoint actions, aiming mostly
at advanced undergraduate and graduate students. In addition, the connection
between such classic theories and the research area of the first author is
explored. Namely, generalizations to isoparametric submanifolds, polar actions
and singular Riemannian foliations with sections (s.r.f.s.) are mentioned. The
first chapters cover basic concepts, giving results on adjoint representation,
closed subgroups, bi-invariant metrics, Killing forms and splitting in simple
ideals. In the following chapters, proper and isometric actions are recalled
together with adjoint action and foliations, mostly concerning the Weyl group,
normal slices and Dynkin diagrams. A special focus is given to maximal tori and
roots of compact Lie groups, exploring its connection with isoparametric
submanifolds and polar actions. Furthermore, in the last chapter, a survey on
recent research results on s.r.f.s. is given.
  In this revised version, more details about fiber bundles, proper and
isometric actions are explored, and further exercises and examples were added.
It also features new sections with examples of singular Riemannian foliations
constructed with surgery and suspension of homomorphisms. This is still a
preliminary version and we expect to improve it in the future. We would be
grateful for any kind of suggestions.
