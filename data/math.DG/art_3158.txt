Similar Curves With Variable Transformations
In this paper, we define a new family of curves and call it a {\it family of
similar curves with variable transformation} or briefly {\it SA-curves}. Also
we introduce some characterizations of this family and we give some theorems.
This definition introduces a new classification of a space curve. Also, we use
this definition to deduce the position vectors of plane curves, general helices
and slant helices, as examples of a similar curves with variable
transformation.
