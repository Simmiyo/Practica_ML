Curvature properties of Lie hypersurfaces in the complex hyperbolic
  space
A Lie hypersurface in the complex hyperbolic space is a homogeneous real
hypersurface without focal submanifolds. The set of all Lie hypersurfaces in
the complex hyperbolic space is bijective to a closed interval, which gives a
deformation of homogeneous hypersurfaces from the ruled minimal one to the
horosphere. In this paper, we study intrinsic geometry of Lie hypersurfaces,
such as Ricci curvatures, scalar curvatures, and sectional curvatures.
