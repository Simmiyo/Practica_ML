The Calabi flow with small initial energy
We show that on Kahler manifolds M with c_1(M)=0 the Calabi flow converges to
a constant scalar curvature metric if the initial Calabi energy is sufficiently
small. We prove a similar result on manifolds with c_1(M)<0 if the Kahler class
is close to the canonical class.
