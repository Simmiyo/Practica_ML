Some Characterizations of Mannheim Partner Curves in Minkowski 3-space
In this paper, we give the characterizations of Mannheim Partner Curves in
Minkowski 3-space . Firstly, we classify these curves in . Next, we give some
relationships characterizing these curves and we show that Mannheim theorem is
not valid for Mannheim partner curves in . Moreover, by considering the
spherical indicatrix of the Fr\'enet vectors of those curves, we obtain some
new relationships between the curvatures and torsions of the Mannheim partner
curves in .
