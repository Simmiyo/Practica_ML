Isometric Immersions of Hypersurfaces in 4-dimensional Manifolds via
  Spinors
We give a spinorial characterization of isometrically immersed hypersurfaces
into 4-dimensional space forms and product spaces $\M^3(\kappa)\times\R$, in
terms of the existence of particular spinor fields, called generalized Killing
spinors or equivalently solutions of a Dirac equation. This generalizes to
higher dimensions several recent results for surfaces by T. Friedrich, B. Morel
and the two authors. The main argument is the interpretation of the
energy-momentum tensor of a generalized Killing spinor as the second
fundamental form, possibly up to a tensor depending on the ambient space. As an
application, we deduce a non-existence result for hypersurfaces in the
4-dimensional Euclidean space.
