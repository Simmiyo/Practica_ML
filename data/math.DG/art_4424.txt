Subelliptic biharmonic maps
We study subelliptic biharmonic maps, i.e. smooth maps from a compact
strictly pseudoconvex CR manifold M into a Riemannian manifold N which are
critical points of a certain bienergy functional. We show that a map is
subelliptic biharmonic if and only if its vertical lift to the (total space of
the) canonical circle bundle is a biharmonic map with respect to the Fefferman
metric.
