Sasakian structures on CR-manifolds
A contact manifold $M$ can be defined as a quotient of a symplectic manifold
$X$ by a proper, free action of $\R^{>0}$, with the symplectic form homogeneous
of degree 2. If $X$ is, in addition, Kaehler, and its metric is also
homogeneous of degree 2, $M$ is called Sasakian. A Sasakian manifold is
realized naturally as a level set of a Kaehler potential on a complex manifold,
hence it is equipped with a pseudoconvex CR-structure. We show that any
Sasakian manifold $M$ is CR-diffeomorphic to an $S^1$-bundle of unit vectors in
a positive line bundle on a projective K\"ahler orbifold. This induces an
embedding from $M$ to an algebraic cone $C$. We show that this embedding is
uniquely defined by the CR-structure. Additionally, we classify the Sasakian
metrics on an odd-dimensional sphere equipped with a standard CR-structure.
