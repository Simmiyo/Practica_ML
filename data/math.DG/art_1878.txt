Conformal structures with explicit ambient metrics and conformal G_2
  holonomy
Given a generic 2-plane field on a 5-dimensional manifold we consider its
(3,2)-signature conformal metric [g] as defined in math.DG/0406400. Every
conformal class [g] obtained in this way has very special conformal holonomy:
it must be contained in the split-real-form of the exceptional group G_2. In
this note we show that for special 2-plane fields on 5-manifolds the conformal
classes [g] have the Fefferman-Graham ambient metrics which, contrary to the
general Fefferman-Graham metrics given as a formal power series, can be written
in an explicit form. We propose to study the relations between the conformal
G_2-holonomy of metrics [g] and the possible pseudo-Riemannian G_2-holonomy of
the corresponding ambient metrics.
