Scherk Saddle Towers of Genus Two in $\R^3$
In 1996 M. Traizet obtained singly periodic minimal surfaces with Scherk ends
of arbitrary genus by desingularizing a set of vertical planes at their
intersections. However, in Traizet's work it is not allowed that three or more
planes intersect at the same line. In our paper, by a {\it saddle-tower} we
call the desingularization of such ``forbidden'' planes into an embedded singly
periodic minimal surface. We give explicit examples of genus two and discuss
some advances regarding this problem. Moreover, our examples are the first ones
containing {\it Gaussian geodesics}, and for the first time we prove
embeddedness of the surfaces CSSCFF and CSSCCC from
Callahan-Hoffman-Meeks-Wohlgemuth.
