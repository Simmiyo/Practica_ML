Curvature estimates for Weingarten hypersurfaces in Riemannian manifolds
We prove curvature estimates for general curvature functions. As an
application we show the existence of closed, strictly convex hypersurfaces with
prescribed curvature $F$, where the defining cone of $F$ is $\C_+$. $F$ is only
assumed to be monotone, symmetric, homogeneous of degree 1, concave and of
class $C^{m,\al}$, $m\ge4$.
