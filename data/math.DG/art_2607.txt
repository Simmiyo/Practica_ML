Minimal hypersurfaces in $\HH^n \times \R$, total curvature and index
In this paper, we consider minimal hypersurfaces in the product space
$\mathbb{H}^n \times \mathbb{R}$. We begin by studying examples of rotation
hypersurfaces and hypersurfaces invariant under hyperbolic translations. We
then consider minimal hypersurfaces with finite total curvature. This
assumption implies that the corresponding curvature goes to zero uniformly at
infinity. We show that surfaces with finite total intrinsic curvature have
finite index. The converse statement is not true as shown by our examples which
also serve as useful barriers.
