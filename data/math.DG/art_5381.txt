A loop group method for Demoulin surfaces in the 3-dimensional real
  projective space
For a surface in the 3-dimensional real projective space, we define a Gauss
map, which is a quadric in $\mathbb R^{4}$ and called the first-order Gauss
map. It will be shown that the surface is a Demoulin surface if and only if the
first-order Gauss map is conformal, and the surface is a projective minimal
coincidence surface or a Demoulin surface if and only if the first-order Gauss
map is harmonic. Moreover for a Demoulin surface, it will be shown that the
first-order Gauss map can be obtained by the natural projection of the Lorentz
primitive map into a 6-symmetric space. We also characterize Demoulin surfaces
via a family of flat connections on the trivial bundle $\D \times \SL$ over a
simply connected domain $\mathbb{D}$ in the Euclidean 2-plane.
