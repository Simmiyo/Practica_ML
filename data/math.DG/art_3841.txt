Homotopes of Symmetric Spaces I. Construction by Algebras with Two
  Involutions
We investigate a special kind of contraction of symmetric spaces
(respectively, of Lie triple systems), called homotopy. In this first part of a
series of two papers we construct such contractions for classical symmetric
spaces in an elementary way by using associative algebras with several
involutions. This construction shows a remarkable duality between the
underlying "space" and the "deformation parameter".
