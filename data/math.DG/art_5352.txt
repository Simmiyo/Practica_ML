On the canonical connection for smooth envelopes
A notion known as smooth envelope, or superposition closure, appears
naturally in several approaches to generalized smooth manifolds which were
proposed in the last decades. Such an operation is indispensable in order to
perform differential calculus. A derivation of the enveloping algebra can be
restricted to the original one, but it is a delicate question if the the
vice-versa can be done as well. In a physical language, this would corresponds
to the existence of a canonical connection. In this paper we show an example of
an algebra which always possesses such a connection.
