Lightlike real hypersurfaces of paraquaternionic manifolds
The main purpose of this paper is to give fundamental properties of real
lightlike hypersurfaces of paraquaternionic manifolds and to prove the
non-existence of real lightlike hypersurfaces in paraquaternionic space forms
under some conditions.
