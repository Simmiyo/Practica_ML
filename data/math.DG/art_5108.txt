Toric LeBrun metrics and Joyce metrics
We show that, on the connected sum of complex projective planes, any toric
LeBrun metric can be identified with a Joyce metric admitting a semi-free
circle action through an explicit conformal equivalence. A crucial ingredient
of the proof is an explicit connection form for toric LeBrun metrics.
