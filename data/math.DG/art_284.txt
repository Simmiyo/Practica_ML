On the Weyl tensor of a self-dual complex 4-manifold
We study complex 4-manifolds with holomorphic self-dual conformal structures,
and we obtain an interpretation of the Weyl tensor of such a manifold as the
projective curvature of a field of cones on the ambitwistor space. In
particular, its vanishing is implied by the existence of some compact,
simply-connected, null-geodesics. We also relate the Cotton-York tensor of an
umbilic hypersurface to the Weyl tensor of the ambient. As a consequence, a
conformal 3-manifold or a self-dual 4-manifold admitting a rational curve as a
null-geodesic is conformally flat. We show that the projective structure of the
beta-surfaces of a self-dual manifold is flat.
