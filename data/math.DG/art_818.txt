The geometric complexity of special Lagrangian $T^2$-cones
We prove a number of results relating various measures (volume, Legendrian
index, stability index, and spectral curve genus) of the geometric complexity
of special Lagrangian $T^2$-cones. We explain how these results fit into a
program to understand the "most common" three-dimensional isolated
singularities of special Lagrangian submanifolds in almost Calabi-Yau
manifolds.
