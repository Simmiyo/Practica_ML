The Higher Spin Dirac Operators on 3-Dimensional Manifolds
We study the higher spin Dirac operators on 3-dimensional manifolds and show
that there exist two Laplace type operators for each associated bundle.
Furthermore, we give lower bound estimations for the first eigenvalues of these
Laplace type operators.
