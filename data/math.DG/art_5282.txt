Surfaces with constant mean curvature 1/2 and genus one in H2xR
We construct new constant mean curvature surfaces in H2xR. They arise as
sister surfaces of Plateau solutions. It is a family of MC 1/2 surfaces with k
ends, genus 1 and k-fold dihedral symmetry, k greater 2. The surfaces are
Alexandrov- embedded.
