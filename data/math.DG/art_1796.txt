Eight-dimensional SU(3)-manifolds of cohomogeneity one
In this paper, we classify 8-dimensional manifolds M admitting an SU(3)
action of cohomogeneity one such that (i) M is simply connected and the orbit
space M/G is isomorphic to [0,1], and (ii) M/G=S^1 and the principal orbits are
simply connected. We discuss applications to the study of the group manifold
SU(3) and to 8-dimensional quaternion-Kahler spaces.
