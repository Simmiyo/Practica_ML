A classification of some Finsler connections and their applications
Some general Finsler connections are defined. Emphasis is being made on the
Cartan tensor and its derivatives. Vanishing of the hv-curvature tensors of
these connections characterizes Landsbergian, Berwaldian as well as Riemannian
structures. This view point makes it possible to give a smart representation of
connection theory in Finsler geometry and yields to a classification of Finsler
connections. Some practical applications of these connections are also
considered.
