Area minimizers and boundary rigidity of almost hyperbolic metrics
This paper is a continuation of our paper about boundary rigidity and filling
minimality of metrics close to flat ones. We show that compact regions close to
a hyperbolic one are boundary distance rigid and strict minimal fillings. We
also provide a more invariant view on the approach used in the above mentioned
paper.
