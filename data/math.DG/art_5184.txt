CMC hypersurfaces of semi-Riemannian groups
In this paper, we study the geometry of a connected oriented cmc Riemannian
hypersurface $M$ of a semi-Riemannian group $G$ of Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$
and index 0 or 1. If $G$ is Riemannian and $M$ is compact and transversal to an
element of $\mathfrak g$, we show that it is a lateral class of a closed
embedded Lie subgroup of $G$; we also do this if $G$ is Lorentzian, provided
$M$ has sufficiently large mean curvature. If $G$ is Riemannian semisimple and
$M$ is compact, we prove that $M$ has degenerate Gauss map and minimal relative
nullity at least 1. We also extend the above results to the case where $M$ is
complete and noncompact. For a Riemannian $G$, we show that a minimal $M$ is
either transversal to an element of $\mathfrak g$, hence stable, or has
degenerate Gauss map and minimal relative nullity at least 1; for $M$ cmc and
transversal to an element of $\mathfrak g$, if we ask the immersion to be
proper and have bounded second fundamental form, then $M$ is also a lateral
class of a closed embedded Lie subgroup of $G$, provided a certain growing
condition on the size of the corresponding Gauss map is satisfied. Finally, for
a Lorentzian group $G$, with sectional curvatures bounded from above on
Lorentzian planes, we extend a result of Y. Xin, proving that a complete $M$ is
totally umbilical, provided it is transversal to a timelike element of
$\mathfrak g$, has large enough mean curvature and bounded hyperbolic Gauss
map.
