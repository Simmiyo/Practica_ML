Sur la Conjecture Des Tores Plats
The present work is devoted to compact completely solvable solvmanifolds
which admit Kahlerian metrics whose Kahler forms are homogeneous. In
particular, we show that such manifolds are diffeomorphic to flat tori. Our
proof is based on Dynkin diagrams associated to left invariant closed 2-forms
in completely solvable Lie groups. These diagrams are shown to be closely
related to Lagrangian foliations,primitive degrees of homogeneous spaces, and
geometric structures such as $(\bkR^ n, Aff (\bkR^ n))$-structures on
symplectic homogeneous spaces.
