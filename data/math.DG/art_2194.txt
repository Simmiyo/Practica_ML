Jet isomorphism for conformal geometry
Jet isomorphism theorems for conformal geometry are discussed. A new proof of
the jet isomorphism theorem for odd-dimensional conformal geometry is outlined,
using an ambient realization of the conformal deformation complex. An infinite
order ambient lift for conformal densities in the case in which harmonic
extension is obstructed is described. A jet isomorphism theorem for even
dimensional conformal geometry is formulated using the inhomogeneous ambient
metrics recently introduced by the author and K. Hirachi.
