Quaternionic connections, induced holomorphic structures and a vanishing
  theorem
We classify the holomorphic structures of the tangent vertical bundle T of
the twistor fibration of a quaternionic manifold (M,Q) of dimension bigger than
four. In particular, we show that any self-dual quaternionic connection on (M,
Q) induces an holomorphic structure on T. We prove that the positive tensor
powers of T have no global holomorphic sections, when (M,Q) is compact and
admits a compatible quaternionic-Kahler metric of negative (respectively, zero)
scalar curvature and the holomorphic structure of T is induced by a closed
(respectively, closed but not exact) quaternionic connection.
