On a Class of Special Riemannian Manifolds
We consider a four dimensional Riemannian manifold M with a metric g and an
affinor structure q. We note the local coordinates of g and q are circulant
matrices. Their first orders are (A, B, C, B)(A, B, C are smooth functions on
M) and (0, 1, 0, 0), respectively.
  Let nabla be the connection of g. Then we obtain:
  1) q^{4}=id; g(qx, qy)=g(x,y), x, y are arbitrary vector fields on M,
  2) nabla q =0 if and only if grad A=(grad C)q^{2}; 2.grad B= (grad
C)(q+q^{3}),
