Leafwise Holomorphic Functions
It is a well-known and elementary fact that a holomorphic function on a
compact complex manifold without boundary is necessarily constant. The purpose
of the present article is to investigate whether, or to what extent, a similar
property holds in the setting of holomorphically foliated spaces.
