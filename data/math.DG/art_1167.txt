The space of doubly periodic minimal tori with parallel ends: Standard
  Examples
We describe a 3-parametric family $\mathcal{K}$ of properly embedded minimal
tori with four parallel ends in quotients of $\mathbb{R}^3$ by two independent
translations, which we will call the \textit{Standard Examples.} These surfaces
generalize the examples given by Karcher, Meeks and Rosenberg in
\cite{ka4,ka6,mr3}. $\mathcal{K}$ can be endowed with a natural structure of a
self-conjugated 3-dimensional real analytic manifold diffeomorphic to
$\mathbb{R}\times(\mathbb{R}^2-\{(\pm 1,0)\})$ whose degenerate limits are the
catenoid, the helicoid, the simply and doubly periodic Scherk minimal surfaces
and the Riemann minimal examples. Perez, Rodriguez and Traizet \cite{PeRoTra1}
characterize $\mathcal{K}$ in the following sense: If $M$ is a properly
embedded minimal torus in a quotient of $\mathbb{R}^3$ by two independent
translations with any number of parallel ends, then $M$ is a finite covering of
a standard example.
