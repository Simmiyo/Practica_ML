Weyl structures on quaternionic manifolds. A state of the art
This is a survey on quaternion Hermitian Weyl (locally conformally quaternion
K\"ahler) and hyperhermitian Weyl (locally conformally hyperk\"ahler)
manifolds. These geometries appear by requesting the compatibility of some
quaternion Hermitian or hyperhermitian structure with a Weyl structure. The
motivation for such a study is two-fold: it comes from the constantly growing
interest in Weyl (and Einstein-Weyl) geometry and, on the other hand, from the
necessity of understanding the existing classes of quaternion Hermitian
manifolds.
