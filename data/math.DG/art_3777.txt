Feuilletage canonique sur le fibré de Weil
Let be M a smooth manifold, A a local algebra and M^{A} a manifold of
infinitely near points on M of kind A. We build the canonical foliation on
M^{A} et we show that the canonical foliation on the tangent bundle TM is the
foliation defined by his canonical field.
