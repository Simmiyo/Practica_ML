Bi-Legendrian manifolds and paracontact geometry
We study the interplays between paracontact geometry and the theory of
bi-Legendrian manifolds. We interpret the bi-Legendrian connection of a
bi-Legendrian manifold M as the paracontact connection of a canonical
paracontact structure induced on M and then we discuss many consequences of
this result both for bi-Legendrian and for paracontact manifolds. Finally new
classes of examples of paracontact manifolds are presented.
