Nearly integrable SO(3)-structures on 5-dimensional Lie groups
Recent work Bobienski-Nurowski on 5-dimensional Riemannian manifolds with an
SO(3) structure prompts us to investigate which Lie groups admit such a
geometry. The case in which the SO(3) structure admits a compatible connection
with torsion is considered. This leads to a classification under special
behaviour of the onnection, which enables to recover all known examples, plus
others bearing torsion of pure type. Suggestive relations with special
structures in other dimensions are highlighted, with attention to
eight-dimensional SU(3) geometry.
