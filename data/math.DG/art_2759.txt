Periodic Geodesics and Geometry of Compact Lorentzian Manifolds with a
  Killing Vector Field
We study the geometry and the periodic geodesics of a compact Lorentzian
manifold that has a Killing vector field which is timelike somewhere. Using a
compactness argument for subgroups of the isometry group, we prove the
existence of one timelike non self-intersecting periodic geodesic. If the
Killing vector field is never vanishing, then there are at least two distinct
periodic geodesics; as a special case, compact stationary manifolds have at
least two periodic timelike geodesics. We also discuss some properties of the
topology of such manifolds. In particular, we show that a compact manifold $M$
admits a Lorentzian metric with a never vanishing Killing vector field which is
timelike somewhere if and only if $M$ admits a smooth circle action without
fixed points.
