Curvature line parametrization from circle patterns
We study local and global approximations of smooth nets of curvature lines
and smooth conjugate nets by respective discrete nets (circular nets and planar
quadrilateral nets) with infinitesimal quads. It is shown that choosing the
points of discrete nets on the smooth surface one can obtain second-order
approximation globally. Also a simple geometric construction for approximate
determination of principal directions of smooth surfaces is given.
