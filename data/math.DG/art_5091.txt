Biminimal properly immersed submanifolds in complete Riemannian
  manifolds of non-positive curvature
We consider a non-negative biminimal properly immersed submanifold $M$ (that
is, a biminimal properly immersed submanifold with $\lambda\geq0$) in a
complete Riemannian manifold $N$ with non-positive sectional curvature. Assume
that the sectional curvature $K^N$ of $N$ satisfies $K^N\geq-L(1+{\rm
dist}_N(\cdot, q_0)^2)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ for some $L>0,$ $2>\alpha \geq 0$
and $q_0\in N$. Then, we prove that $M$ is minimal. As a corollary, we give
that any biharmonic properly immersed submanifold in a hyperbolic space is
minimal. These results give affirmative partial answers to the global version
of generalized Chen's conjecture.
