Jet Geometrical Objects Depending on a Relativistic Time
In this paper we study a collection of jet geometrical concepts, we refer to
d-tensors, relativistic time dependent semisprays, harmonic curves and
nonlinear connections on the 1-jet space J1(R;M), necessary to the construction
of a Miron's-like geometrization for Lagrangians depending on a relativistic
time. The geometrical relations between these jet geometrical objects are
exposed.
