The structure of stable constant mean curvature hypersufaces
We study the global behavior of (weakly) stable constant mean curvature
hypersurfaces in general Riemannian manifolds. By using harmonic function
theory, we prove some one-end theorems which are new even for constant mean
curvature hypersurfaces in space forms.
  In particular, a complete oriented weakly stable minimal hypersurface in
$\mathbb{R}^{n+1}, n\geq 3,$ must have only one end. Any complete noncompact
weakly stable CMC $H$-hypersurface in the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{n+1},
n=3,4,$ with $H^2\geq{10/9}, {7/4},$ respectively, has only one end.
