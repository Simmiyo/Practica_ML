Riemannian Supergeometry
Motivated by a paper of Zirnbauer, we develop a theory of Riemannian
supermanifolds up to a definition of Riemannian symmetric superspaces. Various
fundamental concepts needed for the study of these spaces both from the
Riemannian and the Lie theoretical viewpoint are introduced, e.g. geodesics,
isometry groups and invariant metrics on Lie supergroups and homogeneous
superspaces.
