Locally nearly spherical surfaces are almost-positively $c$-curved
The $c$-curvature of a complete surface with Gauss curvature close to 1 in
$C^2$ norm is almost-positive (in the sense of Kim--McCann). Our proof goes by
a careful case by case analysis combined with perturbation arguments from the
constant curvature case, keeping track of an estimate on the closeness
curvature condition.
