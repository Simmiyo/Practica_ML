Surjectivity of a Gluing Construction in Special Lagrangian Geometry
This paper is motivated by a relatively recent work by Joyce in special
Lagrangian geometry, but the basic idea of the present paper goes back to an
earlier pioneering work of Donaldson in Yang--Mills gauge theory; Donaldson
discovered a global structure of a (compactified) moduli space of Yang--Mills
instantons, and a key step to that result was the proof of surjectivity of
Taubes' gluing construction.
  In special Lagrangian geometry we have currently no such a global
understanding of (compactified) moduli spaces, but in the present paper we
determine a neighbourhood of a `boundary' point. It is locally similar to
Donaldson's result, and in particular as Donaldson's result implies the
surjectivity of Taubes' gluing construction so our result implies the
surjectivity of Joyce's gluing construction in a certain simple case.
