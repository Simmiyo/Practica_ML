Harmonic map heat flow with rough boundary data
Let $B_1$ be the unit open disk in $\Real^2$ and $M$ be a closed Riemannian
manifold. In this note, we first prove the uniqueness for weak solutions of the
harmonic map heat flow in $H^1([0,T]\times B_1,M)$ whose energy is
non-increasing in time, given initial data $u_0\in H^1(B_1,M)$ and boundary
data $\gamma=u_0|_{\partial B_1}$. Previously, this uniqueness result was
obtained by Rivi\`{e}re (when $M$ is the round sphere and the energy of initial
data is small) and Freire (when $M$ is an arbitrary closed Riemannian
manifold), given that $u_0\in H^1(B_1,M)$ and $\gamma=u_0|_{\partial B_1}\in
H^{3/2}(\partial B_1)$. The point of our uniqueness result is that no boundary
regularity assumption is needed. Second, we prove the exponential convergence
of the harmonic map heat flow, assuming that energy is small at all times.
