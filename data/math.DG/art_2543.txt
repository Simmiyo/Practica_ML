Gradient Shrinking Solitons with Vanishing Weyl Tensor
In this paper, we will give a local version of the Hamilton-Ivey type
pinching estimate of the gradient shrinking soliton with vanishing Weyl tensor,
and then give a complete classification on gradient shrinking solitons with
vanishing Weyl tensor.
