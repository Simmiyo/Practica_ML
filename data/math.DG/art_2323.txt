Neutral bi-Hermitian Gray surfaces
The aim of this paper is to give examples of compact neutral 4-manifolds
$(M,g)$ whose Ricci tensor $\rho$ satisfies the relation $\nabla_X\rho(X,X)
=\frac13X\tau g(X,X)$. We present also a family of new Einstein bi-Hermitian
neutral metrics on ruled surfaces of genus $g>1$.
