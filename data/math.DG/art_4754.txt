Natural connections with torsion expressed by the metric tensors on
  almost contact manifolds with B-metric
On a main class of the almost contact manifolds with B-metric, it is
described the family of the linear connections preserving the manifold's
structures by 4 parameters. In this family there are determined the
canonical-type connection and the connection with zero parameters.
