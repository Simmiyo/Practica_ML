Constant Angle Surfaces in a warped product
Let $I \subseteq \R$ be an open interval, $f : I \to \R$ a strictly positive
function and denote by $\E^2$ the Euclidean plane. We classify all surfaces in
the warped product manifold $I \times_f \E^2$ for which the unit normal makes a
constant angle with the direction tangent to $I$.
