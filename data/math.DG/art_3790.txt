Sub-semi-Riemannian geometry on $H$-type groups
We consider $H$(eisenberg)-type groups whose law of left translation gives
rise to a bracket generating distribution of step 2. In the contrast with
sub-Riemannian studies we furnish the horizontal distribution with a
nondegenerate indefinite metric of arbitrary index and investigate the problem
concerning causal geodesics on underlying manifolds. The exact formulae for
geodesics are obtained.
