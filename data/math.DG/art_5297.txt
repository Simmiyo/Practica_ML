Nonnegatively curved 5-manifolds with non-abelian symmetry
We classify compact simply-connected 5-dimensional manifolds which admit a
metric of nonnegative curvature with a connected non-abelian group acting by
isometries. We show that they are diffeomorphic to either S^5, S^3 x S^2, the
nontrivial S^3-bundle over S^2 or the Wu-manifold, SU(3)/SO(3). This result is
a consequence of our equivariant classification of all SO(3) and SU(2)-actions
on compact simply-connected 5-manifolds. In the case of positive curvature we
obtain a partial classification.
