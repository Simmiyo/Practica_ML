Essential points of conformal vector fields
For a conformal vector field $\xi$ on a Riemannian manifold, we say that a
point is essential if there is no local metric in the conformal class for which
$\xi$ is Killing. We show that the only essential points are isolated zeros of
$\xi$. As an application, we show that every connected component of the zero
set of $\xi$ is totally umbilical.
