Constant angle surfaces in the Heisenberg group
In this article we generalize the notion of constant angle surfaces in S^2 x
R and H^2 x R to general Bianchi-Cartan-Vranceanu spaces, i.e. essentially to
three-dimensional homogeneous spaces with a four-dimensional isometry group. We
show that these surfaces have constant Gaussian curvature and we give a
complete local classification in the Heisenberg group.
