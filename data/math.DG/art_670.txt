Hamilton's injectivity radius estimate for sequences with almost
  nonnegative curvature operators
We give a new and complete proof of Hamilton's injectivity radius estimate
for sequences with bounded and almost nonnegative curvature operators,
unbounded diameters, and bump-like origins. Such sequences arise in particular
from dilations about a singularity of the Ricci flow on a 3-manifold.
