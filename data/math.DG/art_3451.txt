On the Morse index of harmonic maps and minimal immersions
In this paper we are concerned with harmonic maps and minimal immersions
defined on compact Riemannian manifolds and with values in homogenous strongly
harmonic manifolds. We show some results on the Morse index by varying these
maps along suitable conformal vector fields. We obtain also that they are
global maxima on some subspaces of the eigenspaces corresponding to the
nonvanishing eigenvalues of the Laplacian operator on the target manifolds.
