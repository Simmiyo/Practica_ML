Symmetries and Invariant Differential Pairings
The purpose of this article is to motivate the study of invariant, and
especially conformally invariant, differential pairings. Since a general theory
is lacking, this work merely presents some interesting examples of these
pairings, explains how they naturally arise, and formulates various associated
problems.
