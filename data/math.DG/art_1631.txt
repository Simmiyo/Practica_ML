Fixed point theorems from a de Rham perspective
Using an elementary argument, we prove new fixed point theorems for classical
elliptic complexes. We obtain new results for conformal relations and
coisotropic intersections. We obtain theorems for the average intersections of
families of special lagrangian and lagrangian varieties in certain homogeneous
spaces.
