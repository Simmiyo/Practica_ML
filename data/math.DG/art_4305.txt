The geometry of canal surfaces and the length of curves in de Sitter
  space
We find the minimal value of the length in de Sitter space of closed
space-like curves with non-vanishing non-space-like geodesic curvature vector.
These curves are in correspondence with closed almost-regular canal surfaces,
and their length is a natural magnitude in conformal geometry. As an
application, we get a lower bound for the total conformal torsion of closed
space curves.
