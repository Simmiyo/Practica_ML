The Complex Structures on $S^{2n}$
Let $\widetilde{\cal J}(S^{2n})$ be the set of orthogonal complex structures
on
  $TS^{2n}$. We show that the twistor space $\widetilde{\cal J}(S^{2n})$ is a
Kaehler manifold. Then we show that an orthogonal almost complex structure
$J_f$ on $S^{2n}$ is integrable if and only if the corresponding section
$f\colon\; S^{2n}\to \widetilde{\cal J}(S^{2n}) $ is holomorphic. These shows
there is no integrable orthogonal complex structure on the sphere $S^{2n}$ for
$n>1$. We also show that there is no complex structure in a neighborhood of the
space $\widetilde{\cal J}(S^{2n})$. The method is to study the first Chern
class of $T^{(1,0)}S^{2n}$.
