An existence result of energy minimizer maps between riemannian
  polyhedra
In this paper, we prove the existence of energy minimizers in each free
homotopy class of maps between polyhedra with target space without focal
points. Our proof involves a careful study of some geometric properties of
riemannian polhyedra without focal points. Among other things, we show that on
the relevant polyhedra, there exists a convex supporting function.
