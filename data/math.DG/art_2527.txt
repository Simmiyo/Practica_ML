Quaternionic contact normal coordinates
This paper constructs a family of coordinate systems about a point on a
quaternionic contact manifold, called quaternionic contact pseudohermitian
normal coordinates. Once defined, conformal variations of the quaternionic
contact structure induce changes on the coordinates which are studied in an
effort to simplify the torsion and curvature at the center point.
