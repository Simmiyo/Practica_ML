On totally real submanifolds
The following results are proved: Theorem 1. A totally real semiparallel
submanifold of constant curvature with parallel f-structure in the normal
bundle of a K\"ahler manifold N is flat or a totally geodesic submanifold of N.
Theorem 2. A totally real minimal semiparallel submanifold M with parallel
f-structure in the normal bundle and of constant length of the second
fundamental form (or equivalently of constant scalar curvature) of a complex
space form N is totally geodesic in N or of positive scalar curvature.
Moreover, if the scalar curvature of M vanishes, then M is flat. Theorem 3. A
complete, compact totally real submanifold with parallel mean curvature vector,
parallel f-structure in the normal bundle and commutative second fundamental
forms of a simply connected complete complex space form is totally geodesic or
a pythagorean product of circles. Note that if M is a totally real submanifold
of a K\"ahler manifold N and the dimension of N is twice the dimension of M,
then the f-structure in the normal bundle vanishes.
