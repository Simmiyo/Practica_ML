Embeddings of almost Hermitian manifolds in almost hyperHermitian those.
  Complex and hypercomplex numbers in differential geometry
Tubular neighborhoods play an important role in differential topology. We
have applied these constructions to geometry of almost Hermitian manifolds. At
first, we consider deformations of tensor structures on a normal tubular
neighborhood of a submanifold in a Riemannian manifold.Further, an almost
hyperHermitian structure has been constructed on the tangent bundle TM with
help of the Riemannian connection of an almost Hermitian structure on a
manifold M then, we consider an embedding of the almost Hermitian manifold M in
the corresponding normal tubular neighborhood of the null section in the
tangent bundle TM equipped with the deformed almost hyperHermitian structure of
the special form.
  As a result,we have obtained that any smooth manifold M of dimension n can be
embedded as a totally geodesic submanifold in a Kaehlerian manifold of
dimension 2n and in a hyperKaehlerian manifold of dimension 4n.
