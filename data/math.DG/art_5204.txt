Diameter Controls and Smooth Convergence away from Singular Sets
We prove that if a family of metrics, $g_i$, on a compact Riemannian
manifold, $M^n$, have a uniform lower Ricci curvature bound and converge to
$g_\infty$ smoothly away from a singular set, $S$, with Hausdorff measure,
$H^{n-1}(S) = 0$, and if there exists connected precompact exhaustion, $W_j$,
of $M^n \setminus S$ satisfying $\diam_{g_i}(M^n) \le D_0 $,
$\vol_{g_i}(\partial W_j) \le A_0 $ and $\vol_{g_i}(M^n \setminus W_j) \le V_j
where \lim_{j\to\infty}V_j=0 $ then the Gromov-Hausdorff limit exists and
agrees with the metric completion of $(M^n \setminus S, g_\infty)$. Recall that
in the prior work with Sormani the same conclusion is reached but the singular
set is assumed to be a submanifold of codimension two. We have a second main
theorem in which the Hausdorff measure condition on $S$ is replaced by diameter
estimates on the connected components of the boundary of the exhaustion,
$\partial W_j$. In addition, we show that the uniform lower Ricci curvature
bounds in these theorems can be replaced by the existence of a uniform linear
contractibility function. If this condition is removed altogether, then we
prove that $\lim_{j\to \infty} d_{\mathcal{F}}(M_j', N')=0$, in which $M_j'$
and $N'$ are the settled completions of $(M, g_j)$ and $(M_\infty\setminus S,
g_\infty)$ respectively and $d_{\mathcal{F}}$ is the Sormani-Wenger Intrinsic
Flat distance. We present examples demonstrating the necessity of many of the
hypotheses in our theorems.
