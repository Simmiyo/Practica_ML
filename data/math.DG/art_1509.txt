Projective Geometry II: Cones and Complete Classifications
The aim of this paper and its prequel is to introduce and classify the
irreducible holonomy algebras of the projective Tractor connection. This is
achieved through the construction of a `projective cone', a Ricci-flat manifold
one dimension higher whose affine holonomy is equal to the Tractor holonomy of
the underlying manifold. This paper uses the result to enable the construction
of manifolds with each possible holonomy algebra.
