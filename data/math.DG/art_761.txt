Some Results on Infinite Dimensional Riemannian Geometry
In this paper we will investigate the global properties of complete Hilbert
manifolds with upper and lower bounded sectional curvature. We shall prove the
Focal Index Lemma that we will allow us to extend some classical results of
finite dimensional Riemannian geometry such as Rauch and Berger Theorems and
the Topogonov Theorem in the class of manifolds on which the Hopf-Rinow Theorem
holds.
