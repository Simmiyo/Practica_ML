Totally quasi-umbilic timelike surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^{1,2}$
For a regular surface in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$, umbilic points are
precisely the points where the Gauss and mean curvatures $K$ and $H$ satisfy
$H^2=K$; moreover, it is well-known that the only totally umbilic surfaces in
$\mathbb{R}^3$ are planes and spheres. But for timelike surfaces in Minkowski
space $\mathbb{R}^{1,2}$, it is possible to have $H^2=K$ at a non-umbilic
point; we call such points {\em quasi-umbilic}, and we give a complete
classification of totally quasi-umbilic timelike surfaces in
$\mathbb{R}^{1,2}$.
