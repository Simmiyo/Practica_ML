Finiteness theorems for nonnegatively curved vector bundles
We prove several finiteness theorems for the normal bundles to souls in
nonnegatively curved manifolds. More generally, we obtain finiteness results
for open Riemannian manifolds whose topology is concentrated on compact domains
of ``bounded geometry''.
