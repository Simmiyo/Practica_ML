On a classification theorem for self-shrinkers
We generalize a classification result for self-shrinkers of the mean
curvature flow with nonnegative mean curvature, which was obtained by T.
Colding and W. Minicozzi, replacing the assumption on polynomial volume growth
with a weighted $L^2$ condition on the norm of the second fundamental form. Our
approach adopt the viewpoint of weighted manifolds and permits also to recover
and to extend some others recent classification and gap results for
self-shrinkers.
