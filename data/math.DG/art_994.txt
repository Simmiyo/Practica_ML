Volume renormalization for complete Einstein--Kähler metrics
For a strictly pseudoconvex domain in a complex manifold we define a
renormalized volume with respect to the approximately Einstein complete
K\"ahler metric of Fefferman. We compute the conformal anomaly in complex
dimension two and apply the result to derive a renormalized
Chern--Gauss--Bonnet formula. Relations between renormalized volume and the CR
$Q$-curvature are also investigated.
