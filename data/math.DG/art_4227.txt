Dynamic Equivalence of Control Systems via Infinite Prolongations
In this paper, we put the issue of dynamic equivalence of control systems in
the context of pullbacks of coframings on infinite jet bundles over the state
manifolds. While much attention has been given to differentially flat systems,
i.e. systems dynamically equivalent to linear control systems, the advantage of
this approach is that it allowed us to consider control affine systems as well.
Through this context we are able to classify all control affine systems of
three states and two controls under dynamic equivalence of the type (x,u) |->
y(x,u).
