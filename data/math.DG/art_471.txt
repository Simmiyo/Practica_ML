A class of complete embedded minimal submanifolds in noncompact
  symmetric spaces
We show that a totally geodesic submanifold of a symmetric space satisfying
certain conditions admits an extension to a minimal submanifold of dimension
one higher, and we apply this result to construct new examples of complete
embedded minimal submanifolds in simply connected noncompact globally symmetric
spaces.
