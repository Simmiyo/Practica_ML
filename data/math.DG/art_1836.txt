Complete real Kahler submanifolds in codimension two
Minimal isometric immersions F in codimension two from a complete Kahler
manifold into Euclidean space had been classified for dimension greater than or
equal to 3. In this note we describe the non--minimal situation by showing
that, if F is real analytic but not everywhere minimal, then F is a cylinder
over a real Kahler surface G in Euclidean 6-space. In addition, G can be
further described.
