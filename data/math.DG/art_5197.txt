On the hyperkaehler/quaternion Kaehler correspondence
A hyperkaehler manifold with a circle action fixing just one complex
structure admits a natural a hyperholomorphic line bundle. This forms the basis
for the construction of a corresponding quaternionic Kaehler manifold in the
work of A.Haydys. We construct in this paper the corresponding holomorphic line
bundle on twistor space and compute many examples, including monopole and Higgs
bundle moduli spaces. We also show that the bundle on twistor space has a
natural meromorphic connection which realizes it as the quantum line bundle for
the hyperkaehler family of holomorphic symplectic structures. Finally we give a
twistor version of the HK/QK correspondence.
