Hausdorff leaf spaces for codim-1 foliations
The topology of the Hausdorff leaf spaces (HLS) for a codim-1 foliation is
the main topic of this paper. At the beginning, the connection between the
Hausdorff leaf space and a warped foliations is examined. Next, the author
describes the HLS for all basic constructions of foliations such as transversal
and tangential gluing, spinning, turbulization, and suspension. Finally, it is
shown that the HLS for any codim-1 foliation on a compact Riemannian manifold
is isometric to a finite connected metric graph. In addition, the author proves
that for any finite connected metric graph G there exists a compact foliated
Riemannian manifold (M,F,g) with codim-1 foliation such that the Hausdorff leaf
space for F is isometric to G. Finally, the necessary and sufficient condition
for warped foliations of codim-1 to converge to HLS(F) is given.
