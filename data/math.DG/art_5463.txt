The Cauchy problem for indefinite improper affine spheres and their
  Hessian equation
We give a conformal representation for indefinite improper affine spheres
which solve the Cauchy problem for their Hessian equation. As consequences, we
can characterize their geodesics and obtain a generalized symmetry principle.
Then, we classify the helicoidal indefinite improper affine spheres and find a
new family with complete non flat affine metric. Moreover, we present
interesting examples with singular curves and isolated singularities.
