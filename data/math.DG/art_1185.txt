Invariant f-structures on the flag manifolds SO(n)/SO(2)xSO(n-3)
We consider manifolds of oriented flags SO(n)/SO(2)xSO(n-3) (n>=4) as 4- and
6-symmetric spaces and indicate characteristic conditions for invariant
Riemannian metrics under which the canonical f-structures on these homogeneous
$\Phi$-spaces belong to the classes Kill f, NKf and G_1f of generalized
Hermitian geometry.
