SUSY structures on deformed supermanifolds
We construct a geometric structure on deformed supermanifolds as a certain
subalgebra of the vector fields. In the classical limit we obtain a decoupling
of the infinitesimal odd and even transformations, whereas in the semiclassical
limit the result is a representation of the supersymmetry algebra. In the case
of mass preserving structure we describe all high energy corrections to this
algebra.
