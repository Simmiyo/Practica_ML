The classification of simple Jacobi--Ricci commuting algebraic curvature
  tensors
We classify algebraic curvature tensors such that the Ricci operator is
simple (i.e. the Ricci operator is complex diagonalizable and either the
complex spectrum consists of a single real eigenvalue or the complex spectrum
consists of a pair of eigenvalues which are complex conjugates of each other)
and which are Jacobi--Ricci commuting (i.e. the Ricci operator commutes with
the Jacobi operator of any vector).
