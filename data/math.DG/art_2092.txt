Some gradient estimates for a diffusion equation on Riemannian manifolds
In this note we present some gradient estimates for the diffusion equation
$\partial_t u=\Delta u-\nabla \phi \cdot \nabla u $ on Riemannian manifolds,
where $\phi $ is a C^2 function, which generalize estimates of R. Hamilton's
and Qi S. Zhang's on the heat equation.
