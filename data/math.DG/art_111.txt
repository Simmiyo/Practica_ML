Refined asymptotics for constant scalar curvature metrics with isolated
  singularities
We consider the asymptotic behaviour of positive solutions u of the conformal
scalar curvature equation, \Delta u + n(n-2)/4 u^{(n+2)(n-2) = 0, in the
neighbourhood of isolated singularities in the standard Euclidean ball.
Although asymptotic radial symmetry for such solutions was proved some time
ago, by Caffarelli, Gidas and Spruck, we present a much simpler and more
geometric derivation of this fact. We also discuss a refinement, showing that
any such solution is asymptotic to one of the deformed radial singular
solutions. Finally we give some applications of these refined asymptotics,
first to computing the global Pohozaev invariants of solutions on the sphere
with isolated singularities, and then to the regularity of the moduli space of
all such solutions.
