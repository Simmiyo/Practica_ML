Euclidean minimal tori with planar ends and elliptic solitons
A Euclidean minimal torus with planar ends gives rise to an immersed Willmore
torus in the conformal 3--sphere $S^3=\R^3\cup \{\infty\}$. The class of
Willmore tori obtained this way is given a spectral theoretic characterization
as the class of Willmore tori with reducible spectral curve. A spectral curve
of this type is necessarily the double of the spectral curve of an elliptic KP
soliton. The simplest possible examples of minimal tori with planar ends are
related to 1--gap Lam\'e potentials, the simplest non--trivial algebro
geometric KdV potentials. If one allows for translational periods, Riemann's
"staircase" minimal surfaces appear as other examples related to 1--gap Lam\'e
potentials.
