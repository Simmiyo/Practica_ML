On four-dimensional anti-self-dual gradient Ricci solitons
In this note we prove that any four-dimensional half conformally flat
gradient steady Ricci soliton must be either Bryant's soliton or Ricci flat. We
also classify four-dimensional half conformally flat gradient shrinking Ricci
solitons with bounded curvature.
