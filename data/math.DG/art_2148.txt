Some remarks on conic degeneration and bending of Poincaré-Einstein
  metrics
Let $(M,g)$ be a compact K\"ahler-Einstein manifold with $c_1 > 0$. Denote by
$K\to M$ the canonical line-bundle, with total space $X$, and $X_0$ the
singular space obtained by blowing down $X$ along its zero section. We employ a
construction by Page and Pope and discuss an interesting multi-parameter family
of Poincar\'e--Einstein metrics on $X$. One 1-parameter subfamily
$\{g_t\}_{t>0}$ has the property that as $t\searrow 0$, $g_t$ converges to a PE
metric $g_0$ on $X_0$ with conic singularity, while $t^{-1}g_t$ converges to a
complete Ricci-flat K\"ahler metric $\hat{g}_0$ on $X$. Another 1-parameters
subfamily has an edge singularity along the zero section of $X$, with cone
angle depending on the parameter, but has constant conformal infinity. These
illustrate some unexpected features of the Poincar\'e-Einstein moduli space.
