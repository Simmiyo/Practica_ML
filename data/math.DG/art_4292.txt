Bott periodicity for inclusions of symmetric spaces
When looking at Bott's original proof of his periodicity theorem for the
stable homotopy groups of the orthogonal and unitary groups, one sees in the
background a differential geometric periodicity phenomenon. We show that this
geometric phenomenon extends to the standard inclusion of the orthogonal group
into the unitary group. Standard inclusions between other classical Riemannian
symmetric spaces are considered as well. An application to homotopy theory is
also discussed.
