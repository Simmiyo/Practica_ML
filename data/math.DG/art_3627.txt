Expanding solitons with non-negative curvature operator coming out of
  cones
We consider Ricci flow of complete Riemannian manifolds which have bounded
non-negative curvature operator, non-zero asymptotic volume ratio and no
boundary. We prove scale invariant estimates for these solutions. Using these
estimates, we show that there is a limit solution, obtained by scaling down
this solution at a fixed point in space. This limit solution is an expanding
soliton coming out of the asymptotic cone at infinity.
