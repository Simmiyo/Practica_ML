Formal Frobenius structures generated by geometric deformation algebras
Necessary and sufficient conditions for some deformation algebras to provide
formal Frobenius structures are given. Also, examples of formal Frobenius
structures with fundamental tensor that is not of the deformation type and
examples of symmetric non-metric connections are presented.
