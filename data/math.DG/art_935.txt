Double products and hypersymplectic structures on $R^{4n}$
In this paper we give a procedure to construct hypersymplectic structures on
$R^{4n}$ beginning with affine-symplectic data on $R^{2n}$. These structures
are shown to be invariant by a 3-step nilpotent double Lie group and the
resulting metrics are complete and not necessarily flat. Explicit examples of
this construction are exhibited.
