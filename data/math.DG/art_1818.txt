L_infinity algebras as 1-jets of simplicial manifolds (and a bit beyond)
The procedure "Lie group --> Lie algebra" has a generalization
  "simplicial manifold --> L_infinity algebra", or yet better,
  "presheaf on the category of surjective submersions --> L_infinity algebra".
  We describe this generalization, together with its higher-order extensions.
