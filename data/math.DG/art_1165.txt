Isometric actions of Heisenberg groups on compact Lorentz manifolds
We prove results toward classifying compact Lorentz manifolds on which
Heisenberg groups act isometrically. We give a general construction, leading to
a new example, of codimension-one actions--those for which the dimension of the
Heisenberg group is one less than the dimension of the manifold. The main
result is a classification of codimension-one actions, under the assumption
they are real-analytic.
