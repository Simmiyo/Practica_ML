Hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space with support function
In this paper we develop a global correspondence between immersed
horospherically convex hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space and complete conformal
metrics on domains in the sphere. We establish results on when the hyperbolic
Gauss map is injective and when an immersed horospherically convex hypersurface
can be unfolded along the normal flow into an embedded one. These results allow
us to establish general Alexandrov reflection principles of elliptic problems
of both Weingarten hypersurfaces and complete conformal metrics and relations
between them. Consequently, we are able to obtain, for instance, a strong
Bernstein theorem for a complete, immersed, horospherically convex hypersurface
of constant mean curvature in hyperbolic space.
