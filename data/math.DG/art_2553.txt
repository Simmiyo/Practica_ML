Surfaces with Parallel Mean Curvature Vector in S^2xS^2 and H^2xH^2
Two holomorphic Hopf differentials for surfaces of non-null parallel mean
curvature vector in S^2xS^2 and H^2xH^2 are constructed. A 1:1 correspondence
between these surfaces and pairs of constant mean curvature surfaces of S^2xR
and H^2xR is established. Using that, surfaces with vanishing Hopf
differentials (in particular spheres with parallel mean curvature vector) are
classified and a rigidity result for constant mean curvature surfaces of S^2xR
and H^2xR is proved.
