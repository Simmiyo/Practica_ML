Constant mean curvature surfaces in Sol with non-empty boundary
In homogenous space Sol we study compact surfaces with constant mean
curvature and with non-empty boundary. We ask how the geometry of the boundary
curve imposes restrictions over all possible configurations that the surface
can adopt. We obtain a flux formula and we establish results that assert that,
under some restrictions, the symmetry of the boundary is inherited into the
surface.
