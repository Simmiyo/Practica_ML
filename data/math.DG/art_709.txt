Imaginary Killing Spinors in Lorenztian Geometry
We study the geometric structure of Lorentzian spin manifolds, which admit
imaginary Killing spinors. The discussion is based on the cone construction and
a normal form classification of skew-adjoint operators in signature $(2,n-2)$.
Derived geometries include Brinkmann spaces, Lorentzian Einstein-Sasaki spaces
and certain warped product structures. Exceptional cases with decomposable
holonomy of the cone are possible.
