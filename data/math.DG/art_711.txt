Nilpotent Spacelike Jorden Osserman pseudo-Riemannian manifolds
Pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of balanced signature which are both spacelike
and timelike Jordan Osserman nilpotent of order 2 and of order 3 have been
constructed previously. In this short note, we shall construct
pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of signature (2s,s) for any s (which is at least 2)
which are spacelike Jordan Osserman nilpotent of order 3 but which are not
timelike Jordan Osserman. Our example and techniques are quite different from
known previously both in that they are not in neutral signature and that the
manifolds constructed will be spacelike but not timelike Jordan Osserman.
