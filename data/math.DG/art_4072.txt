Locally continuously perfect groups of homeomorphisms
The notion of a locally continuously perfect group is introduced and studied.
This notion generalizes locally smoothly perfect groups introduced by Haller
and Teichmann. Next, we prove that the path connected identity component of the
group of all homeomorphisms of a manifold is locally continuously perfect. The
case of equivariant homeomorphism group and other examples are also considered.
