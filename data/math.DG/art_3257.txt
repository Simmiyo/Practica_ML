Nonnegatively curved fixed point homogeneous manifolds in low dimensions
Let $G$ be a compact Lie group acting isometrically on a compact Riemannian
manifold $M$ with nonempty fixed point set $M^G$. We say that $M$ is
fixed-point homogeneous if $G$ acts transitively on a normal sphere to some
component of $M^G$. Fixed-point homogeneous manifolds with positive sectional
curvature have been completely classified. We classify fixed-point homogeneous
Riemannian manifolds in dimensions 3 and 4 and determine which nonnegatively
curved simply-connected 4-manifolds admit a smooth fixed-point homogeneous
circle action with a given orbit space structure.
