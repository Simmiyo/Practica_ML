Complex, symplectic and Kaehler structures on four dimensional Lie
  groups
In this work we deal with left invariant complex and symplectic structures on
simply connected four dimensional solvable real Lie groups. We search the
general form of such structures, when they exist and we make use of this
information to determine all left invariant Kaehler structures. Finally, as an
appendix we compute explicitly the real cohomology of the corresponding Lie
algebras.
