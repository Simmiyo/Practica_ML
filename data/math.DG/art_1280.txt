Martin points on open manifolds of non-positive curvature
The Martin boundary of a Cartan-Hadamard manifold describes a fine geometric
structure at infinity, which is a sub-space of positive harmonic functions. We
describe conditions which ensure that some points of the sphere at infinity
belong to the Martin boundary as well. In the case of the universal cover of a
compact manifold with Ballmann rank one, we show that Martin points are generic
and of full harmonic measure. The result of this paper provides a partial
answer to an open problem of S. T. Yau.
