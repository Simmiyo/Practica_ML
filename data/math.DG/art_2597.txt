Complete minimal surfaces in R3 with a prescribed coordinate function
In this paper we construct complete simply connected minimal surfaces with a
prescribed coordinate function. Moreover, we prove that these surfaces are
dense in the space of all minimal surfaces with this coordinate function (with
the topology of the smooth convergence on compact sets).
