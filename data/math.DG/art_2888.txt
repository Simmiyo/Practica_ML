The number of conformally equivalent maximal graphs
We show that the number of entire maximal graphs with finitely many singular
points that are conformally equivalent is a universal constant that depends
only on the number of singularities, namely 2^$ for graphs with n+1
singularities. We also give an explicit description of the family of entire
maximal graphs with a finite number of singularities all of them lying on a
plane orthogonal to the limit normal vector at infinity.
