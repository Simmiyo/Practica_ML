Lightlike surfaces with planar normal sections in Minkowski 3-space
In this paper we study lightlike surfaces of Minkowski 3- space such that
they have degenerate or non-degenerate planar normal sections. We first show
that every lightlike surface of Minkowski $3-$ space has degenerate planar
normal sections. Then we study lightlike surfaces with non-degenerate planar
normal sections and obtain a characterization for such lightlike surfaces.
