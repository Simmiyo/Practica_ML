Conformal de Rham decomposition of Riemannian manifolds
We prove conformal versions of the local decomposition theorems of de Rham
and Hiepko of a Riemannian manifold as a Riemannian or a warped product of
Riemannian manifolds. Namely, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a
Riemannian manifold to be locally conformal to either a Riemannian or a warped
product. We also obtain other related de Rham-type decomposition theorems. As
an application, we study Riemannian manifolds that admit a Codazzi tensor with
two distinct eigenvalues everywhere.
