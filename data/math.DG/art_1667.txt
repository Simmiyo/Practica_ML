Bihermitian metrics on Del Pezzo surfaces
From a hermitian metric on the anticanonical bundle on a Del Pezzo surface,
and a holomorphic section of it, we construct a one parameter family of
bihermitian metrics (or equivalently generalized Kaehler structures). The
construction appears to be linked to noncommutative geometry.
