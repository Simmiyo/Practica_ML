On the Morgan-Shalen compactification of the SL(2,C) character varieties
  of surface groups
A gauge theoretic description of the Morgan-Shalen compactification of the
$\SL$ character variety of the fundamental group of a hyperbolic surface is
given in terms of a natural compactification of the moduli space of Higgs
bundles via the Hitchin map.
