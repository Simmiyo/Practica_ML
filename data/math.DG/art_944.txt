Scalar curvature rigidity of almost Hermitian spin manifolds which are
  asymptotically complex hyperbolic
This paper generalizes a rigidity result of complex hyperbolic spaces by M.
Herzlich. We prove that an almost Hermitian spin manifold $(M,g)$ of real
dimension $4n+2$ which is strongly asymptotic to $\hyp{\C}^{2n+1}$ and
satisfies a certain scalar curvature bound must be isometric to the complex
hyperbolic space. The fact that we do not assume $g$ to be K\"ahler reflects in
the inequality for the scalar curvature.
