Remarks on non-compact gradient Ricci solitons
In this paper we show how techniques coming from stochastic analysis, such as
stochastic completeness (in the form of the weak maximum principle at
infinity), parabolicity and $L^p$-Liouville type results for the weighted
Laplacian associated to the potential may be used to obtain triviality,
rigidity results, and scalar curvature estimates for gradient Ricci solitons
under $L^p$ conditions on the relevant quantities.
