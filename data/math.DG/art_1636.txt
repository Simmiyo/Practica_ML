The Topology of Open Manifolds with Nonnegative Ricci Curvature
We survey all results concerning the topology of complete noncompact
Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature that have no additional
conditions other than restrictions to the dimension, volume growth or diameter
growth of the manifold. We will also present relevant examples and list open
problems.
