Coplanar constant mean curvature surfaces
We consider constant mean curvature surfaces of finite topology, properly
embedded in three-space in the sense of Alexandrov. Such surfaces with three
ends and genus zero were constructed and completely classified by the authors
in arXiv:math.DG/0102183. Here we extend the arguments to the case of an
arbitrary number of ends, under the assumption that the asymptotic axes of the
ends lie in a common plane: we construct and classify the entire family of
these genus-zero coplanar constant mean curvature surfaces.
