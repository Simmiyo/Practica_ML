Hakenness and b_1
Three great theorems of Thurston read: Haken manifolds are hyperbolic; big
ramified coverings are hyperbolic; big surgeries are hyperbolic. Recent
developments indicate that the later two theorems are essentially a corollary
of the first, that is there are much more Haken manifolds than expected by
Thurston. In fact Freedman showed very recently that big ramified coverings are
Haken. A version of his proof with various improvements was obtained by
Cooper-Long and Cooper-Long-Reid.
  The two main contributions of the present paper are the following. I give an
analytic proof of Freedman's result and the improved version of
Cooper-Long-Reid. This proof is based on fundamentally different approach than
Freedman's and is 10 times shorter, but uses the full forse of the
hyperbolization theorem.
  Secondly, I prove that ANY ramified covering of a tight knot is Haken.
Morover any knot becomes tight after a big surgery. So any ramified covering of
a big surgery is Haken.
  Many other results of the paper are better seen from the introduction.
  The paper uses many different techniques and may be difficult to read for a
beginner.
