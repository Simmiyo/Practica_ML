Strong rigidity of constant curvature Finsler manifolds
Here, an extension of the Obata-Tanno's theorem to Finsler geometry is
established and the following rigidity result is obtained; Every complete
connected Finsler manifold of positive constant flag curvature is isometrically
homeomorphic to an $n$-sphere equipped with a certain Finsler metric, and vise
versa.
