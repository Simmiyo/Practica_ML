Positively curved homogeneous metrics on spheres
We examine homogeneous metrics on spheres and determine which ones have
positive sectional curvature. The answer is subtle and surprisingly difficult
to prove. In some cases we also determine their pinching constants. This
completes the classification of all homogeneous metrics with positive curvature
(apart from one special Aloff Wallach space where the set of homogeneous
metrics is too large).
