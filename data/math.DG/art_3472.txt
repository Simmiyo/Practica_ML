Hodge theory for Riemannian solenoids
A measured solenoid is a compact laminated space endowed with a transversal
measure. The De Rham $L^2$-cohomology of the solenoid is defined by using
differential forms which are smooth in the leafwise directions and $L^2$ in the
transversal direction. We develop the theory of harmonic forms for Riemannian
measured solenoids, and prove that this computes the De Rham $L^2$-cohomology
of the solenoid. This implies in particular a Poincare duality result.
