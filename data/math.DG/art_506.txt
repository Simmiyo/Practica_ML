The conformal theory of Alexandrov embedded constant mean curvature
  surfaces in $R^3$
We first prove a general gluing theorem which creates new nondegenerate
constant mean curvature surfaces by attaching half Delaunay surfaces with small
necksize to arbitrary points of any nondegenerate CMC surface. The proof uses
the method of Cauchy data matching from \cite{MP}, cf. also \cite{MPP}. In the
second part of this paper, we develop the consequences of this result and (at
least partially) characterize the image of the map which associates to each
complete, Alexandrov-embedded CMC surface with finite topology its associated
conformal structure, which is a compact Riemann surface with a finite number of
punctures. In particular, we show that this `forgetful' map is surjective when
the genus is zero. This proves in particular that the CMC moduli space has a
complicated topological structure. These latter results are closely related to
recent work of Kusner \cite{Ku}.
