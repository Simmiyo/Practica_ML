Compactification of the moduli space of rho-vortices
We consider the set of solutions to the rho-vortex equations over a Kahler
surface and prove a Uhlenbeck compactness result, namely that a sequence of
solutions with the same energy converge to the sum of a solution of smaller
energy and deltas of Dirac.
