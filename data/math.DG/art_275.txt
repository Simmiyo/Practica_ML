Veronese webs for bihamiltonian structures of higher corank
It is shown how the well-known class of bihamiltonian structures in general
position can be extended to a wider class. A generalization of the
corresponding notion of a Veronese web for this wider class is presented (in
the general position case Veronese webs form complete systems of local
invariants for bihamiltonian structures). Some examples are considered.
