A lower bound for the diameter of solutions to the Ricci flow with
  nonzero $H^{1}(M^{n};R)$
We obtain a lower bound for the diameter of a solution to the Ricci flow on a
compact manifold with nonvanishing first real cohomology. A consequence of our
result is an affirmative answer to Hamilton's conjecture that a product metric
on $(S^{1}\times S^{n-1}$ cannot arise as a final time limit flow.
