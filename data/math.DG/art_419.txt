Period problems for mean curvature one surfaces in H^3 (with application
  to surfaces of low total curvature)
We survey our recent results on classifying complete constant mean curvature
1 (CMC-1) surfaces in hyperbolic 3-space with low total curvature. There are
two natural notions of "total curvature"-- one is the total absolute curvature
which is the integral over the surface of the absolute value of the Gaussian
curvature, and the other is the dual total absolute curvature which is the
total absolute curvature of the dual CMC-1 surface. Here we discuss results on
both notions (proven in two other papers by the authors), and we introduce some
new results (with proofs) as well.
