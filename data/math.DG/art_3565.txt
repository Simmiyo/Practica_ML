A Compactness Theorem for the Second Fundamental Form
In this note we establish several versions of a compactness theorem for
submanifolds. In particular we require only bounds on the second fundamental
form and do not assume volume or diameter bounds. As an application we prove a
compactness theorem for mean curvature flows and use it to construct smooth
blow-up limits as singularity models.
