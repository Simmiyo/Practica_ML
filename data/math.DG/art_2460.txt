Width and flow of hypersurfaces by curvature functions
We give a bound on the extinction time for a compact, strictly convex
hypersurface in R^{n+1} evolving by a geometric flow where the velocity is
given in terms of the curvature. This result generalizes a theorem of Colding
and Minicozzi for mean curvature flow solutions to a wider class of flows
studied by Ben Andrews. In the proof, we use the concept of the width of a
hypersurface, introduced by Colding and Minicozzi. We also extend the result to
2-convex hypersurfaces, using the 2-width.
