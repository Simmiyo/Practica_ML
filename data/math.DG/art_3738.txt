Minimal translation surfaces in $Sol_3$
In the homogeneous space Sol$_3$, a translation surface is parameterized by
$x(s,t)=\alpha(s)\ast\beta(t)$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are curves contained
in coordinate planes and $\ast$ denotes the group operation of Sol$_3$. In this
paper we study translation surfaces in Sol$_3$ whose mean curvature vanishes.
