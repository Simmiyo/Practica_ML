Conformally invariant differential operators on tensor densities
Let ${\cal F}_\lambda$ be the space of tensor densities on ${\bf R}^n$ of
degree $\lambda$ (or, equivalently, of conformal densities of degree
$-\lambda{}n$) considered as a module over the Lie algebra $so(p+1,q+1)$. We
classify $so(p+1,q+1)$-invariant bilinear differential operators from ${\cal
F}_\lambda\otimes{\cal F}_\mu$ to~${\cal F}_\nu$. The classification of linear
$so(p+1,q+1)$-invariant differential operators from ${\cal F}_\lambda$ to
${\cal F}_\mu$ already known in the literature is obtained in a different
manner.
