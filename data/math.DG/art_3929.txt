Projection bodies in complex vector spaces
The space of Minkowski valuations on an m-dimensional complex vector space
which are continuous, translation invariant and contravariant under the complex
special linear group is explicitly described. Each valuation with these
properties is shown to satisfy geometric inequalities of Brunn-Minkowski,
Aleksandrov-Fenchel and Minkowski type.
