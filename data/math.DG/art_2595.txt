Eigenvalues Estimates for the p-Laplace Operator on Manifolds
We obtain geometric estimates for the first eigenvalue and the fundamental
tone of the p-laplacian on manifolds in terms of admissible vector fields.
Also, we defined a new spectral invariant and we show its relation with the
geometry of the manifold.
