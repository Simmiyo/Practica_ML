Energy functionals and Kähler-Ricci solitons
In this paper, we generalize Chen-Tian energy functionals to K\"ahler-Ricci
solitons and prove that the properness of these functionals is equivalent to
the existence of K\"ahler-Ricci solitons. We also discuss the equivalence of
the lower boundedness of these functionals and their relation with Tian-Zhu's
holomorphic invariant.
