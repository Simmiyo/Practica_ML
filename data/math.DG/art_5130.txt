The Magnetic Ray Transform on Anosov Surfaces
Assume (M,g,\Omega) is a closed, oriented Riemannian surface equipped with an
Anosov magnetic flow. We establish certain results on the surjectivity of the
adjoint of the magnetic ray transform, and use these to prove the injectivity
of the magnetic ray transform on sums of tensors of degree at most two. In the
final section of the paper we give an application to the entropy production of
magnetic flows perturbed by symmetric 2-tensors.
