Zero area singularities in general relativity and inverse mean curvature
  flow
First we restate the definition of a Zero Area Singularity, recently
introduced by H. Bray. We then consider several definitions of mass for these
singularities. We use the Inverse Mean Curvature Flow to prove some new results
about the mass of a singularity, the ADM mass of the manifold, and the capacity
of the singularity.
