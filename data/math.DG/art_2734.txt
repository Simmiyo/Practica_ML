Horizontal normal map on the Heisenberg group
We investigate the notion of H-subdifferential and H-normal map of a function
on the Heisenberg group, based on its sub-Riemannian structure. In particular,
a characterization of the convexity of a function is given via the nonemptiness
of the H-subdifferential at every point.
