About intrinsic Finsler connections for the homogeneous lift to the
  Osculator Bundle of a Finsler metric
In this article we present a study of the subspaces of the manifold OscM, the
total space of the osculator bundle of a real manifold M. We obtain the induced
connections of the canonical metrical N-linear connection determined by the
homogeneous prolongation of a Finsler metric to the manifold OscM. We present
the relation between the induced and intrinsic geometric objects of the
associated osculator submanifold.
