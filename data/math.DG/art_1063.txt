A class of locally symmetric Kaehler Einstein structures on the nonzero
  cotangent bundle of a space form
We obtain a class of locally symetric Kaehler Einstein structures on the
nonzero cotangent bundle of a Riemannian manifold of positive constant
sectional curvature. The obtained class of Kaehler Einstein structures depends
on one essential parameter and cannot have constant holomorphic sectional
curvature.
