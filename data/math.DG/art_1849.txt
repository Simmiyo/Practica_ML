Four-dimensional Riemannian manifolds with commuting higher order Jacobi
  operators
We consider four-dimensional Riemannian manifolds with commuting higher order
Jacobi operators defined on two-dimensional orthogonal subspaces (polygons) and
on their orthogonal subspaces.
  More precisely, we discuss higher order Jacobi operator $\mathcal{J}(X)$ and
its commuting associated operator $\mathcal{J}(X^{\perp})$ induced by the
orthogonal complement $X^{\perp}$ of the vector $X$, i. e.
$\mathcal{J}(X)\circ\mathcal{J}(X^{\perp})=\mathcal{J}(X^{\perp})\circ
\mathcal{J}(X)$.
  At the end some new central theorems have been cited. The latter are due to
P. Gilkey, E. Puffini and V. Videv, and have been recently obtained.
