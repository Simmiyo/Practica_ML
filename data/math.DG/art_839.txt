Affine manifolds, lagrangian manifolds
Let $(M,\omega)$ be a symplectic manifold endowed with a agrangian foliation
${\cal L}$, it has been shown by Weinstein [16] hat the symplectic structure of
$M$ defines on each leaf of ${\cal L}$, connection which curvature and torsion
forms vanish identically. uppose that $L_0$ is a compact leaf which Weinstein
connection is eodesically complete, Molino and Curras-Bosch [2] have classified
erms of such lagrangian foliation around $L_0$. In this paper we xtend this
classification without supposing the completness of he compact leaf. The
Weinstein connection is dual to the Bott onnection, this enables to relate the
conjecture of Auslander nd Markus to transversally properties of these
foliations.
