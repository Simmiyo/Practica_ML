Lagrangian surfaces with circullar ellipse of curvature in complex space
  forms
We classify the Lagrangian orientable surfaces in complex space forms with
the property that the ellipse of curvature is always a circle. As a
consequence, we obtain new characterizations of the Clifford torus of the
complex projective plane and of the Whitney spheres in the complex projective,
complex Euclidean and complex hyperbolic planes.
