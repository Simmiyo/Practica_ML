On geometric properties of joint invariants of Killing tensors
We employ the language of Cartan's geometry to present a model for studying
vector spaces of Killing two-tensors defined in pseudo-Riemannian spaces of
constant curvature under the action of the corresponding isometry group. We
also discuss geometric properties of joint invariants of Killing two-tensors
defined in the Euclidean plane to formulate and prove an analogue of the Weyl
theorem on joint invariants. In addition, it is shown how the joint invariants
manifest themselves in the theory of superintegrable Hamiltonian systems.
