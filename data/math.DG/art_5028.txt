Local reflexion spaces
A reflexion space is generalization of a symmetric space introduced by O.
Loos. We generalize locally symmetric spaces to local reflexion spaces in the
similar way. We investigate, when local reflexion spaces are equivalently given
by a locally flat Cartan connection of certain type.
