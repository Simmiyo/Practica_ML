A Simons type formula for surfaces with parallel mean curvature
We prove a Simons type equation for non-minimal surfaces with parallel mean
curvature vector (pmc surfaces) in $M^n(c)\times\mathbb{R}$, where $M^n(c)$ is
an $n$-dimensional space form. Then, we use this equation in order to
characterize complete non-minimal pmc surfaces with non-negative Gaussian
curvature.
