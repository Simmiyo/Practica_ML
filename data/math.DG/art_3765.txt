A Milnor-Wood inequality for complex hyperbolic lattices in quaternionic
  space
We prove a Milnor-Wood inequality for representations of the fundamental
group of a compact complex hyperbolic manifold in the group of isometries of
quaternionic hyperbolic space. Of special interest is the case of equality, and
its application to rigidity. We show that equality can only be achieved for
totally geodesic representations, thereby establishing a global rigidity
theorem for totally geodesic representations.
