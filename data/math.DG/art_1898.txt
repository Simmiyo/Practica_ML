Fuchsian polyhedra in Lorentzian space-forms
Let S be a compact surface of genus >1, and g be a metric on S of constant
curvature K\in\{-1,0,1\} with conical singularities of negative singular
curvature. When K=1 we add the condition that the lengths of the contractible
geodesics are >2\pi. We prove that there exists a convex polyhedral surface P
in the Lorentzian space-form of curvature K and a group G of isometries of this
space such that the induced metric on the quotient P/G is isometric to (S,g).
Moreover, the pair (P,G) is unique (up to global isometries) among a particular
class of convex polyhedra, namely Fuchsian polyhedra. This extends theorems of
A.D. Alexandrov and Rivin--Hodgson concerning the sphere to the higher genus
cases, and it is also the polyhedral version of a theorem of
Labourie--Schlenker.
