On the geometry of almost $\mathcal{S}$-manifolds
An $f$-structure on a manifold $M$ is an endomorphism field $\phi$ satisfying
$\phi^3+\phi=0$. We call an $f$-structure {\em regular} if the distribution
$T=\ker\phi$ is involutive and regular, in the sense of Palais. We show that
when a regular $f$-structure on a compact manifold $M$ is an almost
$\S$-structure, as defined by Duggal, Ianus, and Pastore, it determines a torus
fibration of $M$ over a symplectic manifold. When $\rank T = 1$, this result
reduces to the Boothby-Wang theorem. Unlike similar results due to
Blair-Ludden-Yano and Soare, we do not assume that the $f$-structure is normal.
We also show that given an almost $\mathcal{S}$-structure, we obtain an
associated Jacobi structure, as well as a notion of symplectization.
