Extended affine Weyl groups and Frobenius manifolds -- II
For the root system of type $B_l$ and $C_l$, we generalize the result of
\cite{DZ1998} by showing the existence of a Frobenius manifold structure on the
orbit space of the extended affine Weyl group that corresponds to any vertex of
the Dynkin diagram instead of a particular choice of \cite{DZ1998}.
