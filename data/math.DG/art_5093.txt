Almost complex surfaces in the nearly Kähler $S^3\times S^3$
In this paper almost complex surfaces of the nearly K\"ahler $S^3\times S^3$
are studied in a systematic way. We show that on such a surface it is possible
to define a global holomorphic differential, which is induced by an almost
product structure on the nearly K\"ahler $S^3\times S^3$. We also find a
correspondence between almost complex surfaces in the nearly K\"ahler
$S^3\times S^3$ and solutions of the general $H$-system equation introduced by
Wente, thus obtaining a geometric interpretation of solutions of the general
$H$-system equation. From this we deduce a correspondence between constant mean
curvature surfaces in $\mathbb R^3$ and almost complex surfaces in the nearly
K\"ahler $S^3\times S^3$ with vanishing holomorphic differential. This
correspondence allows us to obtain a classification of the totally geodesic
almost complex surfaces. Moreover, we will prove that almost complex
topological 2-spheres in $S^3\times S^3$ are totally geodesic. Finally, we also
show that every almost complex surface with parallel second fundamental form is
totally geodesic.
