Spectral characterization of Poincaré-Einstein manifolds with infinity
  of positive Yamabe type
In this paper, we give a sharp spectral characterization of conformally
compact Einstein manifolds with conformal infinity of positive Yamabe type in
dimension $n+1>3$. More precisely, we prove that the largest real scattering
pole of a conformally compact Einstein manifold $(X,g)$ is less than $\ndemi
-1$ if and only if the conformal infinity of $(X,g)$ is of positive Yamabe
type. If this positivity is satisfied, we also show that the Green function of
the fractional conformal Laplacian $P(\alpha)$ on the conformal infinity is
non-negative for all $\alpha\in [0, 2]$.
