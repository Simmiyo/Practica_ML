On a conjecture of Anosov
In this paper, we prove that for every bumpy Finsler $n$-sphere $(S^n,\,F)$
with reversibility $\lambda$ and flag curvature $K$ satisfying
$(\frac{\lambda}{\lambda+1})^2<K\le 1$, there exist $2[\frac{n+1}{2}]$ prime
closed geodesics. This gives a confirmed answer to a conjecture of D. V. Anosov
\cite{Ano} in 1974 for a generic case.
