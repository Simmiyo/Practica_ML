Isometry groups of Lobachevskian spaces, similarity transformation
  groups of Euclidean spaces and Lorentzian holonomy groups
Weakly-irreducible not irreducible subalgebras of $\so(1,n+1)$ were
classified by L. Berard Bergery and A. Ikemakhen. In the present paper a
geometrical proof of this result is given. Transitively acting isometry groups
of Lobachevskian spaces and transitively acting similarity transformation
groups of Euclidean spaces are classified.
