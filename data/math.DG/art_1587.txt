On the curvature groups of a CR manifold
We show that any contact form whose Fefferman metric admits a nonzero
parallel vector field is pseudo-Einstein of constant pseudohermitian scalar
curvature. As an application we compute the curvature groups of the total space
of the canonical circle bundle over a CR manifold.
