Local volume comparison for Kahler manifolds
On Kahler manifolds with Ricci curvature lower bound, assuming the real
analyticity of the metric, we establish a sharp relative volume comparison
theorem for small balls. The model spaces being compared to are complex space
forms, i.e, Kahler manifolds with constant holomorphic sectional curvature.
Moreover, we give an example showing that on Kahler manifolds, the pointwise
Laplacian comparison theorem does not hold when the Ricci curvature is bounded
from below.
