The Conformal Pseudodistance and Null Geodesic Incompleteness
We clarify the relationship between the null geodesic completeness of an
Einstein Lorentz manifold and its conformal Kobayashi pseudodistance. We show
that an Einstein manifold has at least one incomplete null geodesic if its
pseudodistancfe is nontrivial. If its pseudodistance is nondegenerate, all of
its null geodesics must be incomplete. Thus an Einstein manifold (M,g) has no
complete null geodesic if there is a "physical metric" in the conformal class
of g satisfying the null convergence and null generic conditions.
