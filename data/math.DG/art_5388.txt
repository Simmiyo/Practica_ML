Conformal change of Riemannian metrics and biharmonic maps
For the reduction ordinary differential equation due to Baird and Kamissoko
\cite{BK} for biharmonic maps from a Riemannian manifold $(M^m,g)$ into another
one $(N^n,h)$, we show that this ODE has no global positive solution for every
$m\geq 5$. On the contrary, we show that there exist global positive solutions
in the case $m=3$. As applications, for the the Riemannian product $(M^3,g)$ of
the line and a Riemann surface, we construct the new metric $\widetilde{g}$ on
$M^3$ conformal to $g$ such that every nontrivial product harmonic map from
$M^3$ with respect to the original metric $g$ must be biharmonic but not
harmonic with respect to the new metric $\widetilde{g}$.
