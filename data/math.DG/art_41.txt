Embedded minimal ends asymptotic to the helicoid
The ends of a complete embedded minimal surface of {\em finite total
curvature} are well understood (every such end is asymptotic to a catenoid or
to a plane). We give a similar characterization for a large class of ends of
{\em infinite total curvature}, showing that each such end is asymptotic to a
helicoid. The result applies, in particular, to the genus one helicoid and
implies that it is embedded outside of a compact set in ${\mathbb R}^3$.
