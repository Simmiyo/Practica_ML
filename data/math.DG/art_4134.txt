SubRiemannian geodesics for Carnot groups of step 3
In Carnot groups of step 3, all subriemannian geodesics are proved to be
normal. The proof is based on a reduction argument and the Goh condition for
minimality of singular curves. The Goh condition is deduced from a
reformulation and a calculus of the end-point mapping which boils down to the
graded structures of Carnot groups.
