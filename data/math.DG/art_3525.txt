The Conjugate Heat Equation and Ancient Solutions of the Ricci Flow
We prove Gaussian type bounds for the fundamental solution of the conjugate
heat equation evolving under the Ricci flow. As a consequence, for dimension 4
and higher, we show that the backward limit of type I $\kappa$-solutions of the
Ricci flow must be a non-flat gradient shrinking Ricci soliton. This extends
Perelman's previous result on backward limits of $\kappa$-solutions in
dimension 3, in which case that the curvature operator is nonnegative (follows
from Hamilton-Ivey curvature pinching estimate). The Gaussian bounds that we
obtain on the fundamental solution of the conjugate heat equation under
evolving metric might be of independent interest.
