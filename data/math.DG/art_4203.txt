On Timelike Tubular Weingarten Surfaces in Minkowski 3-Space
In this paper, we study the timelike tubular Weingarten surfaces in
3-dimensional Minkowski space $IR_1^3 $.We have obtained some conditions for
being $({K_{II},H})$, $({K_{II},K})$, timelike tubular Weingarten surfaces
where are the second Gaussian curvature the Gaussian curvature and the mean
curvature, respectively.
