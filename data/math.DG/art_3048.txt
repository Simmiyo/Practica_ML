Calabi-Yau domains in three manifolds
We prove that given any compact Riemannian 3-manifold with boundary M, there
exists a smooth properly embedded one-manifold G, included in M, each of whose
components is a simple closed curve and such that the domain D=Int(M)-G does
not admit any properly immersed open surfaces with at least one annular end,
bounded mean curvature, compact boundary (possibly empty) and a complete
induced Riemannian metric.
