The fundamental group of manifolds of positive isotropic curvature and
  surface groups
In this paper we study the topology of compact manifolds of positive
isotropic curvature (PIC). There are many examples of non-simply connected
compact manifolds with positive isotropic curvature. We prove that the
fundamental group of a compact Riemannian manifold with PIC, of dimension
greater than or equal to 5, does not contain a subgroup isomorphic to the
fundamental group of a compact Riemann surface. The proof uses stable minimal
surface theory.
