The topological obstructions to the existence of an irreducible SO(3)
  structure on a five manifold
A nonstandard (maximal) inclusion SO(3) in SO(5) associated with the
irreducible representation \rho_5 of SO(3) in R^5 is considered. The
topological obstructions for admitting the SO(3) structure on the frame bundle
over 5-manifold are investigated. The necessary and sufficient conditions are
formulated.
