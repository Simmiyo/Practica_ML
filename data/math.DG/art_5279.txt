Constrained Willmore and CMC tori in the 3-sphere
Constrained Willmore surfaces are critical points of the Willmore functional
under conformal variations. As shown in [5] one can associate to any
conformally immersed constrained Willmore torus f a compact Riemann surface
\Sigma, such that f can be reconstructed in terms of algebraic data on \Sigma.
Particularly interesting examples of constrained Willmore tori are the tori
with constant mean curvature (CMC) in a 3-dimensional space form. It is shown
in [14] and in [16] that the spectral curves of these tori are hyperelliptic.
In this paper we show under mild conditions that a constrained Willmore torus f
in the 3-sphere is a CMC torus in a 3-dimensional space form if its spectral
curve has the structure of a CMC spectral curve.
