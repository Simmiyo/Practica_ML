Discrete Torsion, Quotient Stacks, and String Orbifolds
This is the writeup of a lecture given at the May Wisconsin workshop on
mathematical aspects of orbifold string theory. In the first part of this
lecture, we review recent work on discrete torsion, and outline how it is
currently understood in terms of the B field. In the second part of this
lecture, we discuss the relationship between quotient stacks and string
orbifolds.
