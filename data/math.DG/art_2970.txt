Constant angle surfaces in Minkowski space
A constant angle surface in Minkowski space is a spacelike surface whose unit
normal vector field makes a constant hyperbolic angle with a fixed timelike
vector. In this work we study and classify these surfaces. In particular, we
show that they are flat. Next we prove that a tangent developable surface
(resp. cylinder, cone) is a constant angle surface if and only if the
generating curve is a helix (resp. a straight-line, a circle).
