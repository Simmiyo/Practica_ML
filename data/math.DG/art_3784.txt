A generalization of a 4-dimensional Einstein manifold
A weakly Einstein manifold is a generalization of a 4-dimensional Einstein
manifold, which is defined as an application of a curvature identity derived
from the generalized Gauss-Bonnet formula for a 4-dimensional compact oriented
Riemannian manifold. In this paper, we shall give a characterization of a
weakly Einstein manifold.
