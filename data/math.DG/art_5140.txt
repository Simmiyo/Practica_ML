Axiomatic Differential Geometry III-1
In this paper is proposed a kind of model theory for our axiomatic
differential geometry. It is claimed that smooth manifolds, which have occupied
the center stage in differential geometry, should be replaced by functors on
the category of Weil algebras. Our model theory is geometrically natural and
conceptually motivated, while the model theory of synthetic differential
geometry is highly artificial and exquisitely technical.
