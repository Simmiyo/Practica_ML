Surfaces and fronts with harmonic-mean curvature one in hyperbolic
  three-space
We investigate surfaces with constant harmonic-mean curvature one (HMC-1
surfaces) in hyperbolic three-space. We allow them to have certain kinds of
singularities, and discuss some global properties. As well as flat surfaces and
surfaces with constant mean curvature one (CMC-1 surfaces), HMC-1 surfaces
belong to a certain class of Weingarten surfaces. From the viewpoint of
parallel surfaces, CMC-1 surfaces and HMC-1 surfaces are representative among
this class.
