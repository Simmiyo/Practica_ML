Spaces of geodesics of pseudo-Riemannian space forms and normal
  congruences of hypersurfaces
We describe natural K\"ahler or para-K\"ahler structures of the spaces of
geodesics of pseudo-Riemannian space forms and relate the local geometry of
hypersurfaces of space forms to that of their normal congruences, or Gauss
maps, which are Lagrangian submanifolds.
  The space of geodesics L(S^{n+1}_{p,1}) of a pseudo-Riemannian space form
S^{n+1}_{p,1} of non-vanishing curvature enjoys a K\"ahler or para-K\"ahler
structure (J,G) which is in addition Einstein. Moreover, in the
three-dimensional case, L(S^{n+1}_{p,1}) enjoys another K\"ahler or
para-K\"ahler structure (J',G') which is scalar flat.
  The normal congruence of a hypersurface s of S^{n+1}_{p,1} is a Lagrangian
submanifold \bar{s} of L(S^{n+1}_{p,1}), and we relate the local geometries of
s and \bar{s}. In particular \bar{s} is totally geodesic if and only if s has
parallel second fundamental form. In the three-dimensional case, we prove that
\bar{s} is minimal with respect to the Einstein metric G (resp. with respect to
the scalar flat metric G') if and only if it is the normal congruence of a
minimal surface s (resp. of a surface s with parallel second fundamental form);
moreover \bar{s} is flat if and only if s is Weingarten.
