The Hyperbolic Geometry of the Sinh-Gordon Equation
This preliminary report studies immersed surfaces of constant mean curvature
in $H^3$ through their {\it adjusted Gauss maps} (as harmonic maps in $S^2$)
and their {\it adjusted frames} in SU(2). Lawson's correspondence between
Euclidean CMC surfaces and their hyperbolic cousins is interpreted here under a
different perspective: the equivalence of their Weierstrass representations
(normalized potentials). This work also presents a construction algorithm for
the moving frame, the adjusted frame, their Maurer-Cartan forms, and ultimately
the CMC immersion.
