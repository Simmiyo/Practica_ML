Pseudolocality of Ricci Flow under Integral Bound of Curvature
We prove a pseudolocality type theorem for compact Ricci Flow under local
integral bounds of curvature. The main tool is Local Ricci Flow introduced by
Deane Yang in [4] and Pseudolocality Theorem of Perelman in [3]. We also study
L^p bounds for the derivatives of curvature and smooth extension of Local Ricci
Flow.
