A rigidity theorem for quaternionic Kaehler structures
We study the moduli space of quaternionic Kaehler structures on a compact
manifold of dimension 4n (n>2) from a point of view of Riemannian geometry, not
twistor theory. Then we obtain a rigidity theorem for quaternionic Kaehler
structures of nonzero scalar curvature by observing the moduli space.
