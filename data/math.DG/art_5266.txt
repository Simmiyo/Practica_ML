A note on the uniqueness of the canonical connection of a naturally
  reductive space
We extend the result in J. Reine Angew. Math. 664, 29-53, to the non-compact
case. Namely, we prove that the canonical connection on a simply connected and
irreducible naturally reductive space is unique, provided the space is not a
sphere, a compact Lie group with a bi-invariant metric or its symmetric dual.
In particular, the canonical connection is unique for the hyperbolic space when
the dimension is different from three. We also prove that the canonical
connection on the sphere is unique for the symmetric presentation. Finally, we
compute the full isometry group (connected component) of a compact and locally
irreducible naturally reductive space.
