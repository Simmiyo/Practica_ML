Pseudo-Riemannian metrics with parallel spinor fields and vanishing
  Ricci tensor
I discuss geometry and normal forms for pseudo-Riemannian metrics with
parallel spinor fields in some interesting dimensions. I also discuss the
interaction of these conditions for parallel spinor fields with the condition
that the Ricci tensor vanish (which, for pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, is not an
automatic consequence of the existence of a nontrivial parallel spinor field).
