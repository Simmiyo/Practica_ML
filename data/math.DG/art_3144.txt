Ford fundamental domains in symmetric spaces of rank one
We show the existence of isometric (or Ford) fundamental regions for a large
class of subgroups of the isometry group of any rank one Riemannian symmetric
space of noncompact type. The proof does not use the classification of
symmetric spaces. All hitherto known existence results of isometric fundamental
regions and domains are essentially subsumed by our work.
