On One-Parameter Families of Dido Riemannian Problems
Locally, isoperimetric problems on Riemannian surfaces are sub-Riemannian
problems in dimension 3. The particular case of Dido problems corresponds to a
class of singular contact sub-Riemannian metrics : metrics which have the
charateristic vertor field as symmetry. We give a classification of the generic
conjugate loci (i.e. classification of generic singularities of the exponential
mapping) of a 1-parameter family of 3-d contact sub-Riemannian metrics
associated to a 1-parameter family of Dido Riemannian problems.
