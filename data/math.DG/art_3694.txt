Systolic volume of homology classes
Given an integer homology class of a finitely presentable group, the systolic
volume quantifies how tight could be a geometric realization of this class. In
this paper, we study various aspects of this numerical invariant showing that
it is a complex and powerful tool to investigate topological properties of
homology classes of finitely presentable groups.
