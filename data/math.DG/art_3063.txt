Compactness of the space of genus-one helicoids
Using the lamination theory developed by Colding and Minicozzi for sequences
of embedded, finite genus minimal surfaces with boundaries going to infinity
\cite{CM5}, we show that the space of genus-one helicoids is compact (modulo
rigid motions and homotheties). This generalizes a result of Hoffman and White
\cite{HW}.
