Vector Fields on Product Manifolds
This short report establishes some basic properties of smooth vector fields
on product manifolds. The main results are: (i) On a product manifold there
always exists a direct sum decomposition into horizontal and vertical vector
fields. (ii) Horizontal and vertical vector fields are naturally isomorphic to
smooth families of vector fields defined on the factors. Vector fields are
regarded as derivations of the algebra of smooth functions.
