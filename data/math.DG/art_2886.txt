De Rham cohomology of diffeological spaces and foliations
Let $(M,\mathcal{F})$ be a foliated manifold. We prove that there is a
canonical isomorphism between the complex of base-like forms
$\Omega^*_b(M,\mathcal{F})$ of the foliation and the "De Rham complex" of the
space of leaves $M/\mathcal{F}$ when considered as a "diffeological" quotient.
Consequently, the two corresponding cohomology groups $H^*_b(M,\mathcal{F})$
and $H^*(M/\mathcal{F})$ are isomorphic.
