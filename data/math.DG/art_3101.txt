An estimate for the sectional curvature of cylindrically bounded
  submanifolds
We give sharp sectional curvature estimates for complete immersed
cylindrically bounded $m$-submanifolds $\phi:M\to N\times\mathbb{R}^{\ell}$,
$n+\ell\leq 2m-1$ provided that either $\phi$ is proper with the second
fundamental form with certain controlled growth or $M$ has scalar curvature
with strong quadratic decay. This latter gives a non-trivial extension of the
Jorge-Koutrofiotis Theorem [7]
