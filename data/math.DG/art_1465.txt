Existence of Natural and Projectively Equivariant Quantizations
We study the existence of natural and projectively equivariant quantizations
for differential operators acting between order 1 vector bundles over a smooth
manifold M. To that aim, we make use of the Thomas-Whitehead approach of
projective structures and construct a Casimir operator depending on a
projective Cartan connection. We attach a scalar parameter to every space of
differential operators, and prove the existence of a quantization except when
this parameter belongs to a discrete set of resonant values.
