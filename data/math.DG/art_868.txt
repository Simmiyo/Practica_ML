Lie algebraic characterization of manifolds
Results on characterization of manifolds in terms of certain Lie algebras
growing on them, especially Lie algebras of differential operators, are
reviewed and extended. In particular, we prove that a smooth (real-analytic,
Stein) manifold is characterized by the corresponding Lie algebra of linear
differential operators, i.e. isomorphisms of such Lie algebras are induced by
the appropriate class of diffeomorphisms of the underlaying manifolds.
