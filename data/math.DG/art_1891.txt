On the space of oriented geodesics of hyperbolic 3-space
We construct a K\"ahler structure (${\mathbb{J}},\Omega,{\mathbb{G}}$) on the
space ${\mathbb{L}}({\mathbb{H}}^3)$ of oriented geodesics of hyperbolic
3-space ${\mathbb{H}}^3$ and investigate its properties. We prove that
(${\mathbb{L}}({\mathbb{H}}^3),{\mathbb{J}})$ is biholomorphic to
${\mathbb{P}}^1\times{\mathbb{P}}^1-\bar{\Delta}$, where $\bar{\Delta}$ is the
reflected diagonal, and that the K\"ahler metric ${\mathbb{G}}$ is of neutral
signature, conformally flat and scalar flat. We establish that the identity
component of the isometry group of the metric ${\mathbb{G}}$ on
${\mathbb{L}}({\mathbb{H}}^3)$ is isomorphic to the identity component of the
hyperbolic isometry group. Finally, we show that the geodesics of
${\mathbb{G}}$ correspond to ruled minimal surfaces in ${\mathbb{H}}^3$, which
are totally geodesic iff the geodesics are null.
