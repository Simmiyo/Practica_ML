Bending and stretching unit vector fields in Euclidean and hyperbolic
  3-space
New examples of harmonic unit vector fields on hyperbolic 3-space are
constructed by exploiting the reduction of symmetry arising from the foliation
by horospheres. This is compared and contrasted with the analogous construction
in Euclidean 3-space, using a foliation by planes, which produces some new
examples of harmonic maps from 3-dimensional Euclidean domains to the 2-sphere.
Finally, the harmonic unit vector field tangent to a parallel family of
hyperbolic geodesics is shown to be unstable, by constructing a class of
compactly supported energy-decreasing variations. All examples considered have
infinite total bending.
