Convex Foliated Projective Structures and the Hitchin Component for
  PSL(4,R)
In this article we give a geometric interpretation of the Hitchin component
for PSL(4,R) in the representation variety of a closed oriented surface of
higher genus. We show that representations in the Hitchin component are
precisely the holonomy representations of properly convex foliated projective
structures on the unit tangent bundle of the surface. From this we also deduce
a geometric description of the Hitchin component the symplectic group PSp(4,R).
