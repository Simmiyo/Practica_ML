On the Developable Mannheim Offsets of Spacelike Ruled Surfaces
In this paper, using the classifications of timelike and spacelike ruled
surfaces, we define and study the Mannheim offsets of spacelike ruled surfaces
in Minkowski 3-space. We give the conditions for spacelike offset surfaces to
be developable.
