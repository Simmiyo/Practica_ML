Spectral properties of 4-dimensional compact flat manifolds
We study the spectral properties of a large class of compact flat Riemannian
manifolds of dimension 4, namely, those whose corresponding Bieberbach groups
have the canonical lattice as translation lattice. By using the explicit
expression of the heat trace of the Laplacian acting on $p$-forms, we determine
all $p$-isospectral and $L$-isospectral pairs and we show that in this class of
manifolds, isospectrality on functions and isospectrality on $p$-forms for all
values of $p$ are equivalent to each other. The list shows for any $p$, $1 \le
p \le 3$, many $p$-isospectral pairs that are not isospectral on functions and
have different lengths of closed geodesics. We also determine all length
isospectral pairs (i.e. with the same length multiplicities), showing that
there are two weak length isospectral pairs that are not length isospectral,
and many pairs, $p$-isospectral for all $p$ and not length isospectral.
