On the geometry and arithmetic of infinite translation surfaces
There are only a few invariants one classically associates with precompact
translation surfaces, among them certain numberfields, i.e. fields which are
finite extensions of the field Q of rational numbers. These fields are closely
related to each other; they are often even equal. We prove by constructing
explicit examples that most of the classical results for number fields
associated to precompact translation surfaces fail in the realm of general
translation surfaces and investigate the relations among these fields. A very
special class of translation surfaces are so called square-tiled surfaces or
origamis. We give a characterization for infinite origamis.
