Generalized Timelike Mannheim Curves in Minkowski space-time $E_1^4$
We give a definition of generalized timelike Mannheim curve in Minkowski
space-time $E_1^4$. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the generalized
timelike Mannheim curve obtain. We show some characterizations of generalized
Mannheim curve.
