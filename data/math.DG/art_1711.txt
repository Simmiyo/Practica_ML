The index of Dirac operators on manifolds with fibered boundaries
Let X be a compact manifold with boundary, and suppose that the boundary is
the total space of a fibration with base Y and fibre Z. Let D be a generalized
Dirac operator associated to a Phi-metric g on X. Under the assumption that D
is fully elliptic we prove an index formula for D. The proof is in two steps:
first, using results of Melrose and Rochon, we show that the index is unchanged
if we pass to a certain b-metric h(s), with s a positive real number. Next we
write the b- (i.e. the APS) index formula for h(s); the Phi-index formula
follows by analyzing the limiting behaviour as s goes to zero of the two terms
in the formula. The interior term is studied directly whereas the adiabatic
limit formula for the eta invariant follows from work of Bismut and Cheeger.
