The generic rank for $A$--plannar structures
The paper mostly collects material on generic rank of $A$--modules with
respect to differential geometric applications. Our research was motivated by
geometry of $A$--structures. In particular, we discuss the case where $A$ is an
unitary associative algebra not necessary with inversion. Some of the examples
are studied in detail.
