Some results on cosymplectic manifolds
We obtain a generalization of the Kodaira-Morrow stability theorem for
cosymplectic structures. We investigate cosymplectic geometry on Lie groups and
on their compact quotients by uniform discrete subgroups. In this way we show
that a compact solvmanifold admits a cosymplectic structure if and only if it
is a finite quotient of a torus.
