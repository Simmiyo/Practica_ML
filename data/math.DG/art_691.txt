Geometry and nonlinear analysis
Nonlinear analysis has played a prominent role in the recent developments in
geometry and topology. The study of the Yang-Mills equation and its cousins
gave rise to the Donaldson invariants and more recently, the Seiberg-Witten
invariants. Those invariants have enabled us to prove a number of striking
results for low dimensional manifolds, particularly, 4-manifolds. The theory of
Gromov-Witten invariants was established by using solutions of the
Cauchy-Riemann equation. These solutions are often refered as
pseudo-holomorphic maps which are special minimal surfaces studied long in
geometry. It is certainly not the end of applications of nonlinear partial
differential equations to geometry. In this talk, we will discuss some recent
progress on nonlinear partial differential equations in geometry. We will be
selective, partly because of my own interest and partly because of recent
applications of nonlinear equations. There are also talks in this ICM to cover
some other topics of geometric analysis by R. Bartnik, B. Andrew, P. Li and
X.X. Chen, etc.
