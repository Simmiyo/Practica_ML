Extremal Kähler metrics on blow-ups of parabolic ruled surfaces
New examples of extremal K\"ahler metrics on blow-ups of parabolic ruled
surfaces are constructed. The method is based on the gluing construction of
Arezzo, Pacard and Singer. This enables to endow ruled surfaces of the form
$\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{O}\oplus L)$ with special parabolic structures such that
the associated iterated blow-up admits an extremal metric of non-constant
scalar curvature.
