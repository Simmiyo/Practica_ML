The Srni lectures on non-integrable geometries with torsion
This review article intends to introduce the reader to non-integrable
geometric structures on Riemannian manifolds and invariant metric connections
with torsion, and to discuss recent aspects of mathematical physics--in
particular superstring theory--where these naturally appear.
  Connections with skew-symmetric torsion are exhibited as one of the main
tools to understand non-integrable geometries. To this aim a a series of key
examples is presented and successively dealt with using the notions of
intrinsic torsion and characteristic connection of a $G$-structure as unifying
principles. % The General Holonomy Principle bridges over to parallel objects,
thus motivating the discussion of geometric stabilizers, with emphasis on
spinors and differential forms. Several Weitzenb\"ock formulas for Dirac
operators associated with torsion connections enable us to discuss spinorial
field equations, such as those governing the common sector of type II
superstring theory. They also provide the link to Kostant's cubic Dirac
operator.
