Balls in complex hyperbolic manifolds
In this paper we get an explicit lower bound for the radius of a Bergman ball
contained in the Dirichlet fundamental polyhedron of a torsion-free discrete
group $G\subset PU(n,1)$ acting on complex hyperbolic space. Consequently the
volume of all complex hyperbolic n-manifolds is bounded below by the volume of
this ball.
