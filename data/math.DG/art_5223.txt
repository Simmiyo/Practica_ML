Axiomatic Differential Geometry III-3
The principal objective in this paer is to study the relationship between the
old kingdom of differential geometry (the category of smooth manifolds) and its
new kingdom (the category of functors on the category of Weil algebras to some
smooth category). It is shown that the canonical embedding of the old kingdom
into the new kingdom preserves Weil functors.
