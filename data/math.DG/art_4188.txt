Stable minimal hypersurfaces in a Riemannian manifold with pinched
  negative sectional curvature
We give an estimate of the first eigenvalue of the Laplace operator on a
complete noncompact stable minimal hypersurface $M$ in a complete simply
connected Riemannian manifold with pinched negative sectional curvature. In the
same ambient space, we prove that if a complete minimal hypersurface $M$ has
sufficiently small total scalar curvature then $M$ has only one end. We also
obtain a vanishing theorem for $L^2$ harmonic 1-forms on minimal hypersurfaces
in a Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature bounded below by a negative
constant. Moreover we provide sufficient conditions for a minimal hypersurface
in a Riemannian manifold with nonpositive sectional curvature to be stable.
