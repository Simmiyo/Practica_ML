Limit sets for complete minimal immersions
In this paper we study the behaviour of the limit set of complete proper
compact minimal immersions in a regular domain G of R^3. We prove that the
second fundamental form of the boundary surface of G is nonnegatively defined
at every point of the limit set of such immersions.
