Existence of closed geodesics on Finsler $n$-spheres
In this paper, we prove that on every Finsler $n$-sphere $(S^n, F)$ with
reversibility $\lambda$ satisfying $F^2<(\frac{\lambda+1}{\lambda})^2g_0$ and
$l(S^n, F)\ge \pi(1+\frac{1}{\lambda})$, there always exist at least $n$ prime
closed geodesics without self-intersections, where $g_0$ is the standard
Riemannian metric on $S^n$ with constant curvature 1 and $l(S^n, F)$ is the
length of a shortest geodesic loop on $(S^n, F)$. We also study the stability
of these closed geodesics.
