Jacobi fields along harmonic maps
We show that Jacobi fields along harmonic maps between suitable spaces
preserve conformality, holomorphicity, real isotropy and complex isotropy to
first order; this last being one of the key tools in the proof by Lemaire and
the author of integrability of Jacobi fields along harmonic maps from the
2-sphere to the complex projective plane.
