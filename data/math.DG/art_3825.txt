Some triviality results for quasi-Einstein manifolds and Einstein warped
  products
In this paper we prove a number of triviality results for Einstein warped
products and quasi-Einstein manifolds using different techniques and under
assumptions of various nature. In particular we obtain and exploit gradient
estimates for solutions of weighted Poisson-type equations and adaptations to
the weighted setting of some Liouville-type theorems.
