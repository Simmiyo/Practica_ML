A representation formula for indefinite improper affine spheres
We construct a new representation formula for indefinite improper affine
spheres in terms of two para-holomorphic functions and study singularities
which appear in this representation formula. As a result, it follows that
cuspidal cross caps never appear as the singularities on indefinite improper
affine spheres and so on. Comparison with other representation formulae are
also studied.
