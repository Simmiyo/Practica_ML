On a Class of Singular Projectively Flat Finsler Metrics with Constant
  Flag Curvature
Singular Finsler metrics, such as Kropina metrics and $m$-Kropina metrics,
have a lot of applications in the real world. In this paper, we classify a
class of singular $(\alpha,\beta)$-metrics which are locally projectively flat
with constant flag curvature in dimension $n= 2$ and $n \ge 3$ respectively.
Further, we determine the local structure of $m$-Kropina metrics and
particularly Kropina metrics which are projectively flat with constant flag
curvature and prove that such metrics must be locally Minkowskian but are not
necessarily flat-parallel.
