Naturally reductive pseudo Riemannian 2-step nilpotent Lie groups
This paper deals with naturally reductive pseudo-Riemannian 2-step nilpotent
Lie groups $(N, \la \,,\,\ra_N)$, such that $\la \,,\,\ra_N$ is invariant under
a left action. The case of nondegenerate center is completely characterized. In
fact, whenever $\la \,,\, \ra_N$ restricts to a metric in the center it is
proved here that the simply connected Lie group $N$ can be constructed starting
from a real representation $(\pi,\vv)$ of a certain Lie algebra $\ggo$. We
study the geometry of $(N, \la \,,\,\ra_N)$ and we find the corresponding
naturally reductive homogeneous structure. On the other hand, related to the
case of degenerate center we provide another family of naturally reductive
spaces, both non compact and also compact examples.
