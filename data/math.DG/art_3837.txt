The energy of a smooth metric measure space and applications
We introduce and study the notion of the energy of a smooth metric measure
space, which includes as special cases the Yamabe constant and Perelman's
$\nu$-entropy. We then investigate some properties the energy shares with these
constants, in particular its relationship with the $\kappa$-noncollapsing
property. Finally, we use the energy to prove a precompactness theorem for the
space of compact quasi-Einstein smooth metric measure spaces, in the spirit of
similar results for Einstein metrics and gradient Ricci solitons.
