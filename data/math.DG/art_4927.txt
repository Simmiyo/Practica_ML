An asymptotic property of Huisken's functional on minimal submanifolds
  of Euclidean space
In this short note, we study the asymptotic property of Huisken's functional
for mean curvature flow on the minimal submanifolds of Euclidean space. We
prove that the limit of Huisken's functional equals to the extrinsic asymptotic
volume ratio on the minimal submanifold of Euclidean space.
