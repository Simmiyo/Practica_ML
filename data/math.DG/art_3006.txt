A diameter bound for Sasaki manifolds with application to uniqueness for
  Sasaki-Einstein structure
In this paper we give a diameter bound for Sasaki manifolds with positive
transverse Ricci curvature. As an application, we obtain the uniqueness of
Sasaki-Einstein metrics on compact Sasaki manifolds modulo the action of the
identity component of the automorphism group for the transverse holomorphic
structure.
