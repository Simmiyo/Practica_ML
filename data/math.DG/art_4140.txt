Backlund transformations of curves in the Galilean and pseudo-Galilean
  spaces
Backlund transformations of admissible curves in the Galilean 3-space and
pseudo-Galilean 3-space and also spatial Backlund transformations of space
curves in Galilean 4-space preserve the torsions under certain assumptions.
