Extremal Configurations of Hinge Structures
We study body-and-hinge and panel-and-hinge chains in R^d, with two marked
points: one on the first body, the other on the last. For a general chain, the
squared distance between the marked points gives a Morse-Bott function on a
torus configuration space. Maximal configurations, when the distance between
the two marked points reaches a global maximum, have particularly simple
geometrical characterizations. The three-dimensional case is relevant for
applications to robotics and molecular structures.
