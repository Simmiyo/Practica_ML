Unified treatment of multisymplectic 3-forms in dimension 6
On a 6-dimensional real vector space $V$ there are three types of
multisymplectic 3-forms. We present in this paper a unified treatment of these
three types. Forms of each type represent a subset of $\Lambda^3 V^*$. In two
cases they are open subsets, in the third one it is a submanifold of
codimension 1. We study the geometry of these subsets.
