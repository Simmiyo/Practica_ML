Twisted submersions in nonnegative sectional curvature
B. Wilking introduced the dual foliation associated to a metric foliation in
a Riemannian manifold with nonnegative sectional curvature, and proved that
when the curvature is strictly positive, the dual foliation contains a single
leaf, so that any two points in the ambient space can be joined by a horizontal
curve. We show that the same phenomenon often occurs for nonnegatively curved
Riemannian submersions even without the strict positive curvature condition,
and irrespective of the particular metric.
