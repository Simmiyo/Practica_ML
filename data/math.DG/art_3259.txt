On the $r-$stability of spacelike hypersurfaces
In this paper we study the strong stability of spacelike hypersurfaces with
constant $r$-th mean curvature in Generalized Robertson-Walker spacetimes of
constant sectional curvature. In particular, we treat the case in which the
ambient spacetime is the de Sitter space.
