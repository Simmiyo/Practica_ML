Basic classes for four-manifolds not of simple type
We extend the notion of basic classes (for the Donaldson invariants) to
4-manifolds with $b^+>1$ which are (potentially) not of simple type or satisfy
$b_1 >0$. We also give a structure theorem for the Donaldson invariants of
4-manifolds with $b^+>1$, $b_1>0$ and of strong simple type.
