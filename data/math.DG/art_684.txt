Lagrange Geometries on Tangent Manifolds
Lagrange geometry is the geometry of the tensor field defined by the
fiberwise Hessian of a non degenerate Lagrangian function on the total space of
a tangent bundle. Finsler geometry is the geometrically most interesting case
of Lagrange geometry. In this paper we study a generalization, which consists
of replacing the tangent bundle by a general tangent manifold, and the
Lagrangian by a family of compatible, local, Lagrangian functions. We give
several examples, and find the cohomological obstractions to globalization.
Then, we extend the connections used in Finsler and Lagrange geometry, while
giving an index free presentation of these connections.
