Ward's solitions
Using the `Riemann Problem with zeros' method, Ward has constructed exact
solutions to a (2+1)-dimensional integrable Chiral Model, which exhibit
solitons with nontrivial scattering. We give a correspondence between what we
conjecture to be all pure soliton solutions and certain holomorphic vector
bundles on a compact surface.
