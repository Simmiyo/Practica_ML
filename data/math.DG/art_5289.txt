A sufficient condition for congruency of orbits of Lie groups and some
  applications
We give a sufficient condition for isometric actions to have the congruency
of orbits, that is, all orbits are isometrically congruent to each other. As
applications, we give simple and unified proofs for some known congruence
results, and also provide new examples of isometric actions on symmetric spaces
of noncompact type which have the congruency of orbits.
