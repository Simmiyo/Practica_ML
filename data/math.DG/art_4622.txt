Self-similar solutions to the mean curvature flows on Riemannian cone
  manifolds and special Lagrangians on toric Calabi-Yau cones
The self-similar solutions to the mean curvature flows have been defined and
studied on the Euclidean space. In this paper we initiate a general treatment
of the self-similar solutions to the mean curvature flows on Riemannian cone
manifolds. As a typical result we extend the well-known result of Huisken about
the asymptotic behavior for the singularities of the mean curvature flows. We
also extend the results on special Lagrangian submanifolds on $\mathbb C^n$ to
the toric Calabi-Yau cones over Sasaki-Einstein manifolds.
