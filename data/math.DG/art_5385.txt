Orthogonal almost complex structures on the Riemannian products of
  even-dimensional round spheres
We discuss the integrability of orthogonal almost complex structures on
Riemannian products of even-dimensional round spheres and give a partial answer
to the question raised by E. Calabi concerning the existence of complex
structures on a product manifold of a round 2-sphere and a round 4-sphere.
