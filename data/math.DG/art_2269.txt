A Rigidity Theorem for the Hemisphere
We prove the following rigidity theorem: For an n-dimensional compact
Riemannian manifold with boundary whose Ricci curvature is bounded by n-1 from
below, if its boundary is isometric to the standard sphere of dimension n-1 and
totally geodesic, then the manifold is isometric to the standard hemisphere.
