Deflection d-Tensor Identities in the Relativistic Time Dependent
  Lagrange Geometry
The aim of this paper is to study the local components of the relativistic
time dependent d-linear connections, d-torsions, d-curvatures and deflection
d-tensors with respect to an adapted basis on the 1-jet space $J^{1}(R,M)$. The
Ricci identities, together with their corresponding identities of deflection
d-tensors, are also given.
