Tamed Symplectic forms and Generalized Geometry
We show that symplectic forms taming complex structures on compact manifolds
are related to special types of almost generalized K\"ahler structures. By
considering the commutator $Q$ of the two associated almost complex structures
$J_{\pm}$, we prove that if either the manifold is 4-dimensional or the
distribution ${Im} \, Q$ is involutive, then the manifold can be expressed
locally as a disjoint union of twisted Poisson leaves.
