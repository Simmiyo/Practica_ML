Surfaces in three-dimensional Lie groups
We derive the Weierstrass (or spinor) representation for surfaces in
three-dimensional Lie groups Nil, \tilde{SL}_2, and Sol with Thurston's
geometries and establish the generating equations for minimal surfaces in these
groups. By using the spectral properties of the corresponding Dirac operators
we find analogs of the Willmore functional for surfaces in these geometries.
