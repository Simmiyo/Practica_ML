Connexions contravariantes sur les groupes de Lie-Poisson
This work is devoted to the study of a class of Poisson-Lie groups endowed
with left invariant metrics. The triples $(G,\pi,<,>)$ are considered, where
$G$ is a simply connected Lie group, ?$\pi$ is a multiplicative Poisson tensor
and $<,>$ is a left invariant riemannian metric such that Hawkins conditions
are satisfied. Hawkins conditions are necessary conditions for the deformation
of the graded algebra of differential forms of a riemannian manifold. These
conditions come from the deformation of the noncommutative spectral triple
describing the manifold. The main result of this thesis is the equivalence
between, on one hand, the geometric problem of classifying riemannian
Poisson-Lie groups that satisfy the conditions of Hawkins and, secondly, the
problem of classifying algebraic structures of Lie bialgebras on Milnor
algebras that satisfy certain conditions. Exploiting the fact that the
structures of Lie bialgebras on Milnor algebras, in certain situations, can be
calculated, we determine riemannian Poisson-Lie groups that satisfy Hawkins in
the linear case, in the case of Heisenberg in the triangular case and in low
dimensions (up to dimension 5). The general case remains an open problem.
