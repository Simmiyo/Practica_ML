The geometry of lightlike hypersurfaces of the de Sitter space
It is proved that the geometry of lightlike hypersurfaces of the de Sitter
space S^{n+1}_1 is directly connected with the geometry of hypersurfaces of the
conformal space C^n. This connection is applied for a construction of an
invariant normalization and an invariant affine connection of lightlike
hypersurfaces as well as for studying singularities of lightlike hypersurfaces.
