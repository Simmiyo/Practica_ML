Complete Vertical Graphs with Constant Mean Curvature in Semi-Riemannian
  Warped Products
We obtain necessary conditions for the existence of complete vertical graphs
of constant mean curvature in the Hyperbolic and Steady State spaces. In the
two-dimensional case we prove Bernstein-type results in each of these ambient
spaces.
