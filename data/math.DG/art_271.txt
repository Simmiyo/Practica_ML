The Bianchi-Darboux transform of L-isothermic surfaces
We study an analogue of the classical Bianchi-Darboux transformation for
L-isothermic surfaces in Laguerre geometry, the Bianchi-Darboux transformation.
We show how to construct the Bianchi-Darboux transforms of an L-isothermic
surface by solving an integrable linear differential system. We then establish
a permutability theorem for iterated Bianchi-Darboux transforms.
