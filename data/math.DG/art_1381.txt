Killing vector fields with twistor derivative
Motivated by the possible characterization of Sasakian manifolds in terms of
twistor forms, we give the complete classification of compact Riemannian
manifolds carrying a Killing vector field whose covariant derivative (viewed as
a 2-form) is a twistor form.
