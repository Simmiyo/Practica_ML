Holomorphic Representation of Constant Mean Curvature Surfaces in
  Minkowski Space: Consequences of Non-Compactness in Loop Group Methods
We give an infinite dimensional generalized Weierstrass representation for
spacelike constant mean curvature (CMC) surfaces in Minkowski 3-space
$\real^{2,1}$. The formulation is analogous to that given by Dorfmeister, Pedit
and Wu for CMC surfaces in Euclidean space, replacing the group $SU_2$ with
$SU_{1,1}$. The non-compactness of the latter group, however, means that the
Iwasawa decomposition of the loop group, used to construct the surfaces, is not
global. We prove that it is defined on an open dense subset, after doubling the
size of the real form $SU_{1,1}$, and prove several results concerning the
behavior of the surface as the boundary of this open set is encountered. We
then use the generalized Weierstrass representation to create and classify new
examples of spacelike CMC surfaces in $\real^{2,1}$. In particular, we classify
surfaces of revolution and surfaces with screw motion symmetry, as well as
studying another class of surfaces for which the metric is rotationally
invariant.
