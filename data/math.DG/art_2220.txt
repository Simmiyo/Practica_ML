On the Existence of Global Bisections of Lie Groupoids
We show that every source connected Lie groupoid always has global bisections
through any given point. This bisection can be chosen to be the multiplication
of some exponentials as close as possible to a prescribed curve. The existence
of bisections through more than one prescribed points is also discussed. We
give some interesting applications of these results.
