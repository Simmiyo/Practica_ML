Algebraic theory of affine curvature tensors
We use curvature decompositions to construct generating sets for the space of
algebraic curvature tensors and for the space of tensors with the same
symmetries as those of a torsion free, Ricci symmetric connection; the latter
naturally appear in relative hypersurface theory.
