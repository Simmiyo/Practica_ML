The exceptional holonomy groups and calibrated geometry
The exceptional holonomy groups are G2 in 7 dimensions, and Spin(7) in 8
dimensions. Riemannian manifolds with these holonomy groups are Ricci-flat.
This is a survey paper on exceptional holonomy, in two parts.
  Part I introduces the exceptional holonomy groups, and explains constructions
for compact 7- and 8-manifolds with holonomy G2 and Spin(7). The simplest such
constructions work by using techniques from complex geometry and Calabi-Yau
analysis to resolve the singularities of a torus orbifold T^7/G or T^8/G, for G
a finite group preserving a flat G2 or Spin(7)-structure on T^7 or T^8. There
are also more complicated constructions which begin with a Calabi-Yau manifold
or orbifold.
  Part II discusses the calibrated submanifolds of G2 and Spin(7)-manifolds:
associative 3-folds and coassociative 4-folds for G2, and Cayley 4-folds for
Spin(7). We explain the general theory, following Harvey and Lawson, and the
known examples. Finally we describe the deformation theory of compact
calibrated submanifolds, following McLean.
