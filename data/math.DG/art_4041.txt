The Classifying Lie Algebroid of a Geometric Structure I: Classes of
  Coframes
We present a systematic study of symmetries, invariants and moduli spaces of
classes of coframes. We introduce a classifying Lie algebroid to give a
complete description of the solution to Cartan's realization problem that
applies to both the local and the global versions of this problem.
