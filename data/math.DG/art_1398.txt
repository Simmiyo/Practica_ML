Self-Similar Solutions to Curvature Flow of Convex Hypersurfaces
We classify the self-similar solutions to a class of Weingarten curvature
flow of connected compact convex hypersurfaces, isometrically immersed into
space forms with non-positive curvature, and obtain a new characterization of a
sphere in a Euclidean space $\R^{n+1}$.
