c horizontal convexity on Carnot groups
Given a real-valued function $c$ defined on the cartesian product of a
generic Carnot group $\G$ and the first layer $V_1$ of its Lie algebra, we
introduce a notion of $c$ horizontal convex ($c$ H-convex) function on $\G$ as
the supremum of a suitable family of affine functions; this family is defined
pointwisely, and depends strictly on the horizontal structure of the group.
This abstract approach provides $c$ H-convex functions that, under appropriate
assumptions on $c,$ are characterized by the nonemptiness of the $c$
H-subdifferential and, above all, are locally H-semiconvex, thereby admitting
horizontal derivatives almost everywhere. It is noteworthy that such functions
can be recovered via a Rockafellar technique, starting from a suitable notion
of $c$ H-cyclic monotonicity for maps. In the particular case where $c(g,v)=<
\xi_1(g),v >,$ we obtain the well-known weakly H-convex functions introduced by
Danielli, Garofalo and Nhieu. Finally, we suggest a possible application to
optimal mass transportation.
