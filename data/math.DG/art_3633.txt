Biharmonic Reeb curves in Sasakian manifolds
Sasakian manifolds provide explicit formulae of some Jacobi operators which
describe the biharmonic equation of curves in Riemannian manifolds. In this
paper we characterize non-geodesic biharmonic curves in Sasakian manifolds
which are either tangent or normal to the Reeb vector field. In the
three-dimensional case, we prove that such curves are some helixes whose
geodesic curvature and geodesic torsion satisfy a given relation.
