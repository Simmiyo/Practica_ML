Soul Theorem for 4-dimensional Topologically Regular Open Nonnegatively
  Curved Alexandrov Spaces
In this paper, we study the topology of topologically regular 4-dimensional
open non-negatively curved Alexandrov spaces. These spaces occur naturally as
the blow-up limits of compact Riemannian manifolds with lower curvature bound.
These manifolds have also been studied by Yamaguchi in his preprint [Yam2002].
Our main tools are gradient flows of semi-concave functions and critical point
theory for distance functions, which have been used to study the 3-dimensional
collapsing theory in the paper [CaoG2010]. The results of this paper will be
used in our future studies of collapsing 4-manifolds, which will be discussed
elsewhere.
