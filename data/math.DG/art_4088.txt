Rigidity of stable cylinders in three-manifolds
In this paper we show how the existence of a certain stable cylinder
determines (locally) the ambient manifold where it is immersed. This cylinder
has to verify a {\it bifurcation phenomena}, we make this explicit in the
introduction. In particular, the existence of such a stable cylinder implies
that the ambient manifold has infinite volume.
