Discrete constant mean curvature surfaces via conserved quantities
This survey article is about discrete constant mean curvature surfaces
defined by an approach related to integrable systems techniques. We introduce
the notion of discrete constant mean curvature surfaces by first introducing
properties of smooth constant mean curvature surfaces. We describe the
mathematical structure of the smooth surfaces using conserved quantities, which
can be converted into a discrete theory in a natural way.
