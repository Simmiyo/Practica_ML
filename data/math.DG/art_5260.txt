Spinorial Representation of Surfaces into 4-dimensional Space Forms
In this paper we give a geometrically invariant spinorial representation of
surfaces in four-dimensional space forms. In the Euclidean space, we obtain a
representation formula which generalizes the Weierstrass representation formula
of minimal surfaces. We also obtain as particular cases the spinorial
characterizations of surfaces in $\R^3$ and in $S^3$ given by T. Friedrich and
by B. Morel
