Hermitian spin surfaces with small eigenvalues of the Dolbeault operator
We study the compact Hermitian spin surfaces with positive conformal scalar
curvature on which the first eigenvalue of the Dolbeault operator of the spin
structure is the smallest possible. We prove that such a surface is either a
ruled surface or a Hopf surface. We give a complete classification of the ruled
surfaces with this property. For the Hopf surfaces we obtain a partial
classification and some examples.
