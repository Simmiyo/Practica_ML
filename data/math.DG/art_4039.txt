The Sasaki-Ricci flow and compact Sasakian manifolds of positive
  transverse holomorphic bisectional curvature
We show that Perelman's W-functional can be generalized to Sasaki-Ricci flow.
When the basic first Chern class is positive, we prove a uniform bound on the
scalar curvature, the diameter and a uniform $C^1$ bound for the transverse
Ricci potential along the Sasaki-Ricci flow, which generalizes Perelman's
results Kahler-Ricci flow to the Sasakian setting. We also show that the
positivity of transverse of holomorphic bisectional curvature is preserved
along the flow, using the methods and the results proved by Bando and Mok in
Kahler setting. In particular, we show that the Sasaki-Ricci flow would
converge to a Sasaki-Ricci soliton if the initial metric has nonnegative
transverse holomorphic bisectional curvature.
