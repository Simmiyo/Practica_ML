Nearly Kahler homogeneous manifolds with positive curvature
We prove that a 2n-dimensional compact homogeneous nearly Kahler manifold
with strictly positive sectional curvature is isometric to CP^{n}, equipped
with the symmetric Fubini-Study metric or with the standard Sp(m)-homogeneous
metric, n =2m-1, or to S^{6} as Riemannian manifold with constant sectional
curvature. This is a positive answer for a revised version of a conjecture
given by Gray.
