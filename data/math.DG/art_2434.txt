A connection with skew symmetric torsion and Kähler curvature tensor
  on quasi-Kähler manifolds with Norden metric
There is considered a connection with skew symmetric torsion on a
quasi-K\"ahler manifold with Norden metric. Some necessary and sufficient
conditions are derived for the corresponding curvature tensor to be
K\"ahlerian. In the case when this tensor is K\"ahlerian, some relations are
obtained between its scalar curvature and the scalar curvature of other
curvature tensors. Conditions are given for the considered manifolds to be
isotropic-K\"ahler.
