Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand sequences
This paper is devoted to the study of geometric structures modeled on
homogeneous spaces G/P, where G is a real or complex semisimple Lie group and
$P\subset G$ is a parabolic subgroup. We use methods from differential geometry
and very elementary finite-dimensional representation theory to construct
sequences of invariant differential operators for such geometries, both in the
smooth and the holomorphic category. For G simple, these sequences specialize
on the homogeneous model G/P to the celebrated (generalized)
Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand resolutions in the holomorphic category, while in the
smooth category we get smooth analogs of these resolutions. In the case of
geometries locally isomorphic to the homogeneous model, we still get
resolutions, whose cohomology is explicitly related to a twisted de Rham
cohomology. In the general (curved) case we get distinguished curved analogs of
all the invariant differential operators occurring in Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand
resolutions (and their smooth analogs).
  On the way to these results, a significant part of the general theory of
geometrical structures of the type described above is presented here for the
first time.
