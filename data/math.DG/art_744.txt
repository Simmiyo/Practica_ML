Pencils of geodesics in symmetric spaces, Karpelevich boundary, and
  associahedron-like polyhedra
There are several ways of a construction of a boundary of a symmetric space
using pencils of geodesics: the Karpelevich boundary, the visibility boundary,
the associahedral boundary, and the sea urchin. We give explicit descriptions
of these boundaries. We obtain some moduli space like polyhedra as sections of
these compactifications by Cartan subspaces. For simplicity, we consider only
the space $GL_n/O_n$ of ellipsoids in $R^n$.
