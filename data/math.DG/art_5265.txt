Nullity distributions associated to Cartan connection
The Klein-Grifone approach to global Finsler geometry is adopted. The nullity
distributions of the three curvature tensors of Cartan connection are
investigated. Nullity distributions concerning certain relevant special Finsler
spaces are considered. Concrete examples are given whenever the situation
needs.
