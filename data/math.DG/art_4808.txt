Low dimensional Singular Riemannian Foliations in spheres
Singular Riemannian Foliations are particular types of foliations on
Riemannian manifolds, in which leaves locally stay at a constant distance from
each other. Singular Riemannian Foliations in round spheres play a special
role, since they provide "infinitesimal information" about general Singular
Riemannian Foliations. In this paper we show that Singular Riemannian
Foliations in spheres, of dimension at most 3, are orbits of an isometric group
action.
