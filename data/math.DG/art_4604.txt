On complete submanifolds with parallel mean curvature in product spaces
We prove a Simons type formula for submanifolds with parallel mean curvature
vector field in product spaces of type $M^n(c)\times\mathbb{R}$, where $M^n(c)$
is a space form with constant sectional curvature $c$, and then we use it to
characterize some of these submanifolds.
