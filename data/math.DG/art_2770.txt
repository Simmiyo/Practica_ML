On the normal holonomy representation of spacelike submanifolds in
  pseudo-Riemannian space forms
In this paper we study weakly irreducible holonomy representations of the
normal connection of a spacelike submanifold in a pseudo-Riemannian space from.
We associate screen representations to weakly irreducible normal holonomy
groups and classify the screen representations having the Borel-Lichn\'erowicz
property. In particular, we derive a classification of Lorentzian normal
holonomy representations.
