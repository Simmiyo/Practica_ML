The geometry of fractional osculator bundle of higher order and
  applications
Using the reviewed Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative we introduce the
fractional osculator Lagrange space of k order and the main structures on it.
The results are applied at the k order fractional prolongation of Lagrange,
Finsler and Riemann fractional structures.
