On a Gromoll-Meyer type theorem in globally hyperbolic stationary
  spacetimes
Following the lines of the celebrated Riemannian result of Gromoll and Meyer,
we use infinite dimensional equivariant Morse theory to establish the existence
of infinitely many geometrically distinct closed geodesics in a class of
globally hyperbolic stationary Lorentzian manifolds.
