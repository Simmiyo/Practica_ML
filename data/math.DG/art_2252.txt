General Connections, Exponential Maps, and Second-order Differential
  Equations
The main purpose of this article is to introduce a comprehensive, unified
theory of the geometry of all connections. We show that one can study a
connection via a certain, closely associated second-order differential
equation. One of the most important results is our extended
Ambrose-Palais-Singer correspondence. We extend the theory of geodesic sprays
to certain second-order differential equations, show that locally diffeomorphic
exponential maps can be defined for all, and give a full theory of (possibly
nonlinear) covariant derivatives for (possibly nonlinear) connections. In the
process, we introduce vertically homogeneous connections. Unlike homogeneous
connections, these complete our theory and allow us to include Finsler spaces
in a completely consistent manner.
