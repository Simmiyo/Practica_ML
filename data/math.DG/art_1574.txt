Morse index of constant mean curvature tori of revolution in the
  3-sphere
We compute lower bounds for the Morse index and nullity of constant mean
curvature tori of revolution in the three-dimensional unit sphere. In
particular, all such tori have index at least five, with index growing at least
linearly with respect to the number of the surfaces' bulges, and the index of
such tori can be arbitrarily large.
