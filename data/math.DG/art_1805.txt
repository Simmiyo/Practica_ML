The Lie algebra of the group of bisections
Groupoids provide a more appropriate framework for differential geometry than
principal bundles. Synthetic differential geometry is the avant-garde branch of
differential geometry, in which nilpotent infinitesimals are available in
abundance. The principal objective in this paper is to show within our favorite
framework of synthetic differential geometry that the tangent space of the
group of bisections of a microlinear groupoid at its identity is naturally a
Lie algebra. We give essentially distinct two proofs for its Jacobi identity.
