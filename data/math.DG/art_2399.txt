A Sobolev-like inequality for the Dirac operator
In this article, we prove a Sobolev-like inequality for the Dirac operator on
closed compact Riemannian spin manifolds with a nearly optimal Sobolev
constant. As an application, we give a criterion for the existence of solutions
to a nonlinear equation with critical Sobolev exponent involving the Dirac
operator. We finally specify a case where this equation can be solved.
