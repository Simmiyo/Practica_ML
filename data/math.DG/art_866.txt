Classification of four-dimensional Lie algebras admitting a
  para-hypercomplex structure
The main goal is to classify 4-dimensional real Lie algebras $\g$ which admit
a para-hypercomplex structure. This is a step toward the classification of Lie
groups admitting the corresponding left-invariant structure and therefore
possessing a neutral, left-invariant, anti-self-dual metric. Our study is
related to the work of Barberis who classified real, 4-dimensional
simply-connected Lie groups which admit an invariant hypercomplex structure.
