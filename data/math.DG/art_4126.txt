Almost complex connections on almost complex manifolds with Norden
  metric
A four-parametric family of linear connections preserving the almost complex
structure is defined on an almost complex manifold with Norden metric.
Necessary and sufficient conditions for these connections to be natural are
obtained. A two-parametric family of complex connections is studied on a
conformal K\"{a}hler manifold with Norden metric. The curvature tensors of
these connections are proved to coincide.
