Differentiability, Convenient Spaces and Smooth Diffeologies
We review the basic definitions and properties concerning smooth structures,
convenient spaces, diffeological spaces and tangent structures. The relation
betwen them is described. A tangent structure is constructed for each
pre-convenient space. This one is proved to be convenient iff the space and the
tangent fibres coincide. Some basic comments on the relation with manifolds are
given.
