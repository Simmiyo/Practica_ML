Some Rigidity Conditions on Berwald Structures
This thesis contains an introduction to the method of average in Finsler
geometry. The method is applied to Berwald spaces, obtaining geodesic rigidity
conditions. We prove that the Levi-Civita connection of any Riemannian metric
affine equivalent to the Berwald metric leaves invariant the indicatrix of th
Finsler metric F. A converse result also holds: if (M,F) is a Finsler structure
such that there is a Riemannian connection whose Levi-Civita leaves invariant
by parallel transport the indicatrix of the Finsler structure, then the
structure (M,F) is Berwald. As an application we obtain a necessary condition
for a structure to be Landsberg but not Berwald.
