Geodesicity and Isoclinity Properties for the Tangent Bundle of the
  Heisenberg Manifold with Sasaki Metric
We prove that the horizontal and vertical distributions of the tangent bundle
with the Sasaki metric are isocline, the distributions given by the kernels of
the horizontal and vertical lifts of the contact form $\omega$ from the
Heisenberg manifold $(H_3,g)$ to $(TH_3,g^S)$ are not totally geodesic, and the
distributions $F^H=L(E_1^H,E_2^H)$ and $F^V=L(E_1^V,E_2^V)$ are totally
geodesic, but they are not isocline. We obtain that the horizontal and natural
lifts of the curves from the Heisenberg manifold $(H_3,g)$, are geodesics in
the tangent bundle endowed with the Sasaki metric $(TH_3,g^s)$, if and only if
the curves considered on the base manifold are geodesics. Then, we get two
particular examples of geodesics from $(TH_3,g^s)$, which are not horizontal or
natural lifts of geodesics from the base manifold $(H_3,g)$.
