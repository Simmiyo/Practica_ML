New homogeneous Einstein metrics of negative Ricci curvature
We construct new homogeneous Einstein spaces with negative Ricci curvature in
two ways: First, we give a method for classifying and constructing a class of
rank one Einstein solvmanifolds whose derived algebras are two-step nilpotent.
As an application, we describe an explicit continuous family of ten-dimensional
Einstein manifolds with a two-dimensional parameter space, including a
continuous subfamily of manifolds with negative sectional curvature. Secondly,
we obtain new examples of non-symmetric Einstein solvmanifolds by modifying the
algebraic structure of non-compact irreducible symmetric spaces of rank greater
than one, preserving the (constant) Ricci curvature.
