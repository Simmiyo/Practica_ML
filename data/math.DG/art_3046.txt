A Lie algebra for Frölicher groups
Fr\"olicher spaces form a cartesian closed category which contains the
category of smooth manifolds as a full subcategory. Therefore, mapping groups
such as C^\infty(M,G) or \Diff(M), but also projective limits of Lie groups are
in a natural way objects of that category, and group operations are morphisms
in the category. We call groups with this property Fr\"olicher groups. One can
define tangent spaces to Fr\"olicher spaces, and in the present article we
prove that, under a certain additional assumption, the tangent space at the
identity of a Fr\"olicher group can be equipped with a Lie bracket. We discuss
an example which satisfies the additional assumption.
