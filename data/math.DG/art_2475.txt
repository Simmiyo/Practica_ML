Differential Harnack Estimates for Backward Heat Equations with
  Potentials under the Ricci Flow
In this paper, we derive a general evolution formula for possible Harnack
quantities. As a consequence, we prove several differential Harnack
inequalities for positive solutions of backward heat-type equations with
potentials (including the conjugate heat equation) under the Ricci flow. We
shall also derive Perelman's Harnack inequality for the fundamental solution of
the conjugate heat equation under the Ricci flow.
