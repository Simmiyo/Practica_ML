Fibres affines
We study affine maps between affine manifolds. Even when the fibers are
compact and diffeomorphic, two of them can inherit different affine structures
from the source space. This leads to a fixed linear holonomy deformation theory
of the affine structure of an affine manifold. We found various conditions
which make the fibers to be affinely isomorphic. We also classify affine
bundles which total space is a compact and complete affine manifold.
