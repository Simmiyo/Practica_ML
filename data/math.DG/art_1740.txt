Harmonic morphisms with one-dimensional fibres on conformally-flat
  Riemannian manifolds
We classify the harmonic morphisms with one-dimensional fibres (1) from
real-analytic conformally-flat Riemannian manifolds of dimension at least four,
and (2) between conformally-flat Riemannian manifolds of dimensions at least
three.
