Intrinsic torsion classes of Riemannian structures
This article introduces the problem of finding intrinsic torsion varieties
associated to G-structures on a fixed parallelizable Riemannian manifold. As an
illustration, the intrinsic torsion varieties of orthogonal almost product
structures are analysed on the Iwasawa manifold.
