The moduli space of embedded singly periodic maximal surfaces with
  isolated singularities in the Lorentz-Minkowski space $ł^3$
We show that, up to some natural normalizations, the moduli space of singly
periodic complete embedded maximal surfaces in the Lorentz-Minkowski space
$\l^3=(\r^3,dx_1^2+dx_2^2-dx_3^2),$ with fundamental piece having a finite
number $(n+1)$ of singularities, is a real analytic manifold of dimension
$3n+4.$ The underlying topology agrees with the topology of uniform convergence
of graphs on compact subsets of $\{x_3=0\}.$
