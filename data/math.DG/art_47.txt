Poisson structures on double Lie groups
Lie bialgebra structures are reviewed and investigated in terms of the double
Lie algebra, of Manin- and Gau{\ss}-decompositions. The standard R-matrix in a
Manin decomposition then gives rise to several Poisson structures on the
correponding double group, which is investigated in great detail.
