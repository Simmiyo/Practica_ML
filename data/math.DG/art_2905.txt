On the Funk transform on compact symmetric spaces
We prove that a function on an irreducible compact symmetric space M, which
is not a sphere, is determined by its integrals over the shortest closed
geodesics in M. We also prove a support theorem for the Funk transform on rank
one symmetric spaces which are not spheres.
