The relation between parameter curves and lines of curvature on canal
  surfaces
A canal surface is the envelope of a moving sphere with varying radius,
defined by the trajectory C(t) (spine curve) of its center and a radius
function r(t). In this paper, we investigate when parameter curves of the canal
surface are also lines of curvature. Last of all, for special spine curves we
obtain the radius function of canal surfaces.
