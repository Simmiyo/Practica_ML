Les applications conforme-harmoniques
On a Riemannian surface, the energy of a map into a Riemannian manifold is a
conformal invariant functional, and its critical points are the harmonic maps.
Our main result is a generalization of this theorem when the starting manifold
is even dimensional. We then build a conformal invariant functional for the
maps between two Riemannian manifolds. Its critical points then called
C--harmonic are the solutions of a nonlinear elliptic PDE of order $n$, which
is conformal covariant with respect to the start manifold. For the trivial case
of real or complex functions of $M$, we find again the GJMS operator, with a
leading part power to the $n/2$ of the Laplacian. When $n$ is odd, we prove
that the constant term of the asymptotic expansion of the energy of an
asymptotically harmonic map on an AHE manifold $(M^{n+1},g_+)$ is an absolute
invariant of $g_+$.
