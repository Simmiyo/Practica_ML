Metric shape of hypersurfaces with small extrinsic radius or large $
  λ_1$
We determine the Hausdorff limit-set of the Euclidean hypersurfaces with
large $\lambda_1$ or small extrinsic radius. The result depends on the $L^p$
norm of the curvature that is assumed to be bounded a priori, with a critical
behaviour for $p$ equal to the dimension minus 1.
