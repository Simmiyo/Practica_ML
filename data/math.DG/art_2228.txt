Mean-value property on manifolds with minimal horospheres
Let (M,g) be a non-compact and complete Riemannian manifold with minimal
horospheres and infinite injectivity radius. We prove that bounded functions on
(M,g) satisfying the mean-value property are constant. We extend thus a result
of A. Ranjan and H. Shah who proved a similar result for bounded harmonic
functions on harmonic manifolds with minimal horospheres.
