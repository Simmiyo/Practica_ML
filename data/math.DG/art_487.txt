Ricci flow on Kähler-Einstein manifolds
In our previous paper math.DG/0010008, we develop some new techniques in
attacking the convergence problems for the K\"ahler Ricci flow. The one of main
ideas is to find a set of new functionals on curvature tensors such that the
Ricci flow is the gradient like flow of these functionals. We successfully find
such functionals in case of Kaehler manifolds. On K\"ahler-Einstein manifold
with positive scalar curvature, if the initial metric has positive bisectional
curvature, we prove that these functionals have a uniform lower bound, via the
effective use of Tian's inequality. Consequently, we prove the following
theorem: Let $M$ be a K\"ahler-Einstein manifold with positive scalar
curvature. If the initial metric has nonnegative bisectional curvature and
positive at least at one point, then the K\"ahler Ricci flow will converge
exponentially fast to a K\"ahler-Einstein metric with constant bisectional
curvature. Such a result holds for K\"ahler-Einstein orbifolds.
