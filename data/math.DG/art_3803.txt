Moduli Space of General Connections
We consider local invariants of general connections (with torsion). The group
of origin-preserving diffeomorphisms acts on a space of jets of general
connections. Dimensions of moduli spaces of generic connections are calculated.
Poincar\'e series of the geometric structure of connection is constructed, and
shown to be a rational function, confirming the finiteness assertion of Tresse.
