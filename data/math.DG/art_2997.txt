Convergence of Calabi-Yau manifolds
In this paper, we study the convergence of Calabi-Yau manifolds under
K\"{a}hler degeneration to orbifold singularities and complex degeneration to
canonical singularities (including the conifold singularities), and the
collapsing of a family of Calabi-Yau manifolds.
