On the Structure of Complex Homogeneous Supermanifolds
For a Lie group $G$ and a closed Lie subgroup $H\subset G$, it is well known
that the coset space $G/H$ can be equipped with the structure of a manifold
homogeneous under $G$ and that any $G$-homogeneous manifold is isomorphic to
one of this kind. An interesting problem is to find an analogue of this result
in the case of supermanifolds.
  In the classical setting, $G$ is a real or a complex Lie group and $G/H$ is a
real and, respectively, a complex manifold. Now, if $G$ is a real Lie
supergroup and $H\subset G$ is a closed Lie subsupergroup, there is a natural
way to consider $G/H$ as a supermanfold. Furthermore, any $G$-homogeneous real
supermanifold can be obtained in this way, see \cite{Kostant}. The goal of this
paper is to give a proof of this result in the complex case.
