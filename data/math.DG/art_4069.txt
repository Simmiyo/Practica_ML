A sharp lower bound for the scalar curvature of certain steady gradient
  Ricci solitons
We show that the scalar curvature of a steady gradient Ricci soliton
satisfying that the ratio between the square norm of the Ricci tensor and the
square of the scalar curvature is bounded by one half, is boundend from below
by the hyperbolic secant of one half the distance function from a fixed point.
