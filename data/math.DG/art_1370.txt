Boundary regularity for the Monge-Ampere and affine maximal surface
  equations
In this paper, we prove global second derivative estimates for solutions of
the Dirichlet problem for the Monge-Ampere equation when the inhomogeneous term
is only assumed to be Holder continuous. As a consequence of our approach, we
also establish the existence and uniqueness of globally smooth solutions to the
second boundary value problem for the affine maximal surface equation and
affine mean curvature equation.
