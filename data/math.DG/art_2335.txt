Reconstructing the geometric structure of a Riemannian symmetric space
  from its Satake diagram
The local geometry of a Riemannian symmetric space is described completely by
the Riemannian metric and the Riemannian curvature tensor of the space. In the
present article I describe how to compute these tensors for any Riemannian
symmetric space from the Satake diagram, in a way that is suited for the use
with computer algebra systems. As an example application, the totally geodesic
submanifolds of the Riemannian symmetric space SU(3)/SO(3) are classified.
  The submission also contains an example implementation of the algorithms and
formulas of the paper as a package for Maple 10, the technical documentation
for this implementation, and a worksheet carrying out the computations for the
space SU(3)/SO(3) used in the proof of Proposition 6.1 of the paper.
