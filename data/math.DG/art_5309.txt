Closeness to spheres of hypersurfaces with normal curvature bounded
  below
For a Riemannian manifold $M^{n+1}$ and a compact domain $\Omega \subset
M^{n+1}$ bounded by a hypersurface $\partial \Omega$ with normal curvature
bounded below, estimates are obtained in terms of the distance from $O$ to
$\partial \Omega$ for the angle between the geodesic line joining a fixed
interior point $O$ in $\Omega$ to a point on $\partial \Omega$ and the outward
normal to the surface. Estimates for the width of a spherical shell containing
such a hypersurface are also presented.
