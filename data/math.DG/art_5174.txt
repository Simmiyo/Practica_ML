The Weyl problem with nonnegative Gauss curvature in hyperbolic space
In this paper, we discuss the isometric embedding problem in hyperbolic space
with nonnegative extrinsic curvature. We prove a priori bounds for the trace of
the second fundamental form H and extend the result to n-dimensions. We also
obtain an estimate for the gradient of the smaller principal curvature in 2
dimensions.
