Global Lie-Tresse theorem
We prove a global algebraic version of the Lie-Tresse theorem which states
that the algebra of differential invariants of an algebraic pseudogroup action
on a differential equation is generated by a finite number of
rational-polynomial differential invariants and invariant derivations.
