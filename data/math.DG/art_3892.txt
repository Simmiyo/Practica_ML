Algebraic constructions in the category of vector bundles
The category of generalized Lie algebroids is presented. We obtain an
exterior differential calculus for generalized Lie algebroids. In particular,
we obtain similar results with the classical and modern results for Lie
algebroids. So, a new result of Maurer-Cartan type is presented. Supposing that
any vector subbundle of the pullback vector bundle of a generalized Lie
algebroid is called interior differential system (IDS) for that generalized Lie
algebroid, a theorem of Cartan type is obtained. Extending the classical notion
of exterior differential system (EDS) to generalized Lie algebroids, a theorem
of Cartan type is obtained. Using the theory of linear connections of Ehresmann
type presented in the paper [1], the identities of Cartan and Bianchi type are
presented.
