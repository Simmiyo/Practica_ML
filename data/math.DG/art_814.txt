A remark on capillary surfaces in a 3-dimensional space of constant
  curvature
We generalize a theorem by J. Choe on capillary surfaces for arbitrary
3-dimensional spaces of constant curvature. The main tools in this paper are an
extension of a theorem of H. Hopf due to S.-S. Chern and two index lemmas by J.
Choe.
