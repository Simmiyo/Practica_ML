Isoperimetric regions in H^2 between parallel horocycles
In this work we investigate the following isoperimetric problem in the
hyperbolic plane: to find the regions of prescribed area with minimal perimeter
between two parallel horocycles. We give an explicit and detailed description
of all such regions.
