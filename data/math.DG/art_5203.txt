Index Theory of Non-compact $G$-manifolds
The index theorem, discovered by Atiyah and Singer in 1963, is one of most
important results in the twentieth century mathematics. It found numerous
applications in analysis, geometry and physics. Since it was discovered
numerous attempts to generalize it were made, see for example [5, 3, 4, 16, 12]
to mention a few; some of these generalizations gave rise to new very
productive areas of mathematics. In this lectures we first review the classical
Atiyah-Singer index theorem and its generalization to so called transversally
elliptic operators (Atiyah, 1974) due to Atiyah and Singer. Then we discuss the
recent developments aimed at generalization of the index theorem for
transversally elliptic operators to non-compact manifolds, [24, 10].
