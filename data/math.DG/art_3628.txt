Index theory for basic Dirac operators on Riemannian foliations
In this paper we prove a formula for the analytic index of a basic Dirac-type
operator on a Riemannian foliation, solving a problem that has been open for
many years. We also consider more general indices given by twisting the basic
Dirac operator by a representation of the orthogonal group. The formula is a
sum of integrals over blowups of the strata of the foliation and also involves
eta invariants of associated elliptic operators. As a special case, a
Gauss-Bonnet formula for the basic Euler characteristic is obtained using two
independent proofs.
