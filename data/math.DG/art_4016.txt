Isospectral Submersion Metrics
We construct continuous families of pairwise isospectral metrics on various
Riemannian manifolds (e.g., Lie groups, projective spaces and products of these
with tori) which arise as quotients of other manifolds. This is done by
developing a general principle which guarantees that the torus method can be
used to simultaneously construct isospectral metrics on a manifold and a
quotient of it. Furthermore, a suffient condition will be given such that the
constructed metrics are submersion metrics.
