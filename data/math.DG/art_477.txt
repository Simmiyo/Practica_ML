Classification and existence of doubly-periodic instantons
We present a classification of SU(2) instantons on $T^2\times\mathbb{R}^2$
according to their asymptotic behaviour. We then study the existence of such
instantons for different values of the asymptotic parameters, describing
explicitly the moduli space for unit charge.
