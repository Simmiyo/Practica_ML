Desingularization of Coassociative 4-folds with Conical Singularities:
  Obstructions and Applications
We study the problem of desingularizing coassociative conical singularities
via gluing, allowing for topological and analytic obstructions, and discuss
applications. This extends the author's earlier work on the unobstructed case.
We interpret the analytic obstructions geometrically via the obstruction theory
for deformations of conically singular coassociative 4-folds, and thus relate
them to the stability of the singularities. We use our results to describe the
relationship between moduli spaces of coassociative 4-folds with conical
singularities and those of their desingularizations. We also apply our theory
in examples, including to the known conically singular coassociative 4-folds in
compact holonomy G_2 manifolds.
