Supremum of Perelman's entropy and Kähler-Ricci flow on a Fano
  manifold
In this paper, we extend the method in [TZhu5] to study the energy level
$L(\cdot)$ of Perelman's entropy $\lambda(\cdot)$ for K\"ahler-Ricci flow on a
Fano manifold. Consequently, we first compute the supremum of $\lambda(\cdot)$
in K\"ahler class $2\pi c_1(M)$ under an assumption that the modified Mabuchi's
K-energy $\mu(\cdot)$ defined in [TZhu2] is bounded from below. Secondly, we
give an alternative proof to the main theorem about the convergence of
  K\"ahler-Ricci flow in [TZhu3].
