A local version of Bando's theorem on the real-analyticity of solutions
  to the Ricci flow
It is a theorem of S. Bando that if $g(t)$ is a solution to the Ricci flow on
a compact manifold $M$, then $(M, g(t))$ is real-analytic for each $t >0$. In
this note, we extend his result to smooth solutions on open domains $U\subset
M$.
