Isothermic surfaces in sphere geometries as Moutard nets
We give an elaborated treatment of discrete isothermic surfaces and their
analogs in different geometries (projective, M\"obius, Laguerre, Lie). We find
the core of the theory to be a novel projective characterization of discrete
isothermic nets as Moutard nets. The latter belong to projective geometry and
are nets with planar faces defined through a five-point property: a vertex and
its four diagonal neighbors span a three dimensional space. Analytically this
property is equivalent to the existence of representatives in the space of
homogeneous coordinates satisfying the discrete Moutard equation. Restricting
the projective theory to quadrics, we obtain Moutard nets in sphere geometries.
In particular, Moutard nets in M\"obius geometry are shown to coincide with
discrete isothermic nets. The five-point property in this particular case says
that a vertex and its four diagonal neighbors lie on a common sphere, which is
a novel characterization of discrete isothermic surfaces. Discrete Laguerre
isothermic surfaces are defined through the corresponding five-plane property
which requires that a plane and its four diagonal neighbors share a common
touching sphere. Equivalently, Laguerre isothermic surfaces are characterized
by having an isothermic Gauss map. We conclude with Moutard nets in Lie
geometry.
