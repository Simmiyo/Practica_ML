A uniform Sobolev inequality under Ricci flow
Let ${\bf M}$ be a compact Riemannian manifold and the metrics $g=g(t)$
evolve by the Ricci flow. We prove the following result. The Sobolev imbedding
by Aubin or Hebey, perturbed by a scalar curvature term and modulo sharpness of
constants, holds uniformly for $({\bf M}, g(t))$ for all time if the Ricci flow
exists for all time; and if the Ricci flow develops a singularity in finite
time, then the same Sobolev imbedding holds uniformly after a standard
normalization. As a consequence, long time non-collapsing results are derived,
which improve Perelman's local non-collapsing results. An application to 3-d
Ricci flow with surgery is also presented.
