On the existence of harmonic morphisms from certain symmetric spaces
In this paper we give a positive answer to the open existence problem for
complex-valued harmonic morphisms from the non-compact irreducible Riemannian
symmetric spaces $SL_n(R)/SO(n)$, $SU^*(2n)/Sp(n)$ and their compact duals
$SU(n)/SO(n)$ and $SU(2n)/Sp(n)$. Furthermore we prove the existence of
globally defined, complex-valued harmonic morphisms from any Riemannian
symmetric space of type IV.
