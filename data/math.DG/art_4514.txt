Hierarchies and compatibility on Courant algebroids
We extend to the context of Courant algebroids several hierarchies that can
be constructed on Poisson-Nijenhuis manifolds. More precisely, we introduce
several notions (Poisson-Nijenhuis, deformation-Nijenhuis and Nijenhuis pairs)
that extend to Courant algebroids the notion of a Poisson-Nijenhuis manifold,
by using the idea that both the Poisson and the Nijenhuis structures, although
they seem to be different in nature when considered on manifolds, are just
$(1,1)$-tensors on the usual Courant algebroid $TM \oplus T^*M $ satisfying
several constraints. For each of the generalizations mentioned, we show that
there are natural hierarchies obtained by successive deformation by one of the
$(1,1)$-tensor.
