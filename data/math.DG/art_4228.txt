Mean curvature self-shrinkers of high genus: Non-compact examples
We give the first rigorous construction of complete, embedded self-shrinking
hypersurfaces under mean curvature flow, since Angenent's torus in 1989. The
surfaces exist for any sufficiently large prescribed genus $g$, and are
non-compact with one end. Each has $4g+4$ symmetries and comes from
desingularizing the intersection of the plane and sphere through a great
circle, a configuration with very high symmetry. Each is at infinity asymptotic
to the cone in $\mathbb{R}^3$ over a $2\pi/(g+1)$-periodic graph on an equator
of the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^2\subseteq\mathbb{R}^3$, with the shape of a
periodically "wobbling sheet". This is a dramatic instability phenomenon, with
changes of asymptotics that break much more symmetry than seen in minimal
surface constructions. The core of the proof is a detailed understanding of the
linearized problem in a setting with severely unbounded geometry, leading to
special PDEs of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type with fast growth on coefficients of the
gradient terms. This involves identifying new, adequate weighted H\"older
spaces of asymptotically conical functions in which the operators invert, via a
Liouville-type result with precise asymptotics.
