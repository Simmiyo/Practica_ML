Uniqueness of static decompositions
We classify static manifolds which admit more than one static decomposition
whenever a condition on the curvature is fullfilled. For this, we take a
standard static vector field and analyze its associated one parameter family of
projections onto the base. We show that the base itself is a static manifold
and the warping function satisfies severe restrictions, leading us to our
classification results. Moreover, we show that certain condition on the
lightlike sectional curvature ensures the uniqueness of static decomposition
for Lorentzian manifolds.
