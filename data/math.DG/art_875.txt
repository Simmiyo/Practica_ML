Towards a classification of CMC-1 Trinoids in hyperbolic space via
  conjugate surfaces
We derive necessary conditions on the parameters of the ends of a CMC-1
trinoid in hyperbolic 3-space $H^{3}$ with symmetry plane by passing to its
conjugate minimal surface. Together with Daniel's results, this yields a
classification of generic symmetric trinoids. We also discuss the relation to
other classification results of trinoids by Bobenko et al. and Umehara-Yamada.
  To obtain the result above, we show that the conjugate minimal surface of a
catenoidal CMC-1 end in $H^{3}$ with symmetry plane is asymptotic to a suitable
helicoid.
