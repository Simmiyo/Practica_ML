Extended obstruction tensors and renormalized volume coefficients
The behavior under conformal change of the renormalized volume coefficients
associated to a pseudo-Riemannian metric is investigated. It is shown that they
define second order fully nonlinear operators in the conformal factor whose
algebraic structure is elucidated via the introduction of "extended obstruction
tensors". These together with the Schouten tensor constitute building blocks
for the coefficients in the ambient metric expansion. The renormalized volume
coefficients have recently been considered by Chang-Fang motivated by
comparison with the elementary symmetric functions of the eigenvalues of the
Schouten tensor.
