Non-negatively curved 5-manifolds with almost maximal symmetry rank
We show that a closed, simply-connected, non-negatively curved 5-manifold
admitting an effective, isometric $T^2$ action is diffeomorphic to one of
$S^5$, $S^3\times S^2$, $S^3\tilde{\times} S^2$ (the non-trivial $S^3$-bundle
over $S^2$) or the Wu manifold $SU(3)/SO(3)$.
