New components of the Moduli space of minimal surfaces in 4-dimensional
  flat tori
In this paper, we consider new components of the key space of the Moduli
space of minimal surfaces in flat 4-tori and calculate their dimensions.
Moreover, we construct an example of minimal surfaces in 4-tori and obtain an
element of the Moduli. In the process of the construction, we give an example
of minimal surfaces with good property in a 3-torus distinct from classical
examples.
