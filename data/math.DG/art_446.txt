Fromula for the Projectively Invariant Quantization on Degree Three
We give an explicit formula for the projectively invariant quantization map
between the space of symbols of degree three and the space of third-order
linear differential operators, both viewed as modules over the group of
diffeomorphisms and the Lie algebra of vector fields on a manifold.
