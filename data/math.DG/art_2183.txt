The ambient metric
This paper provides details of the construction, properties and some
applications of the ambient metric associated to a conformal class of metrics
on a smooth manifold. Existence and uniqueness of formal expansions defining
such metrics are considered. Equivalence with the expansions of associated
Poincare metrics is established. Definitions and properties of conformal
curvature tensors defined by ambient metrics together with formulation and
proof of a jet isomorphism theorem with application to the characterization of
scalar conformal invariants are given.
