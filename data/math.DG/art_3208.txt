Harmonic morphisms and bicomplex manifolds
We use functions of a bicomplex variable to unify the existing constructions
of harmonic morphisms from a 3-dimensional Euclidean or pseudo-Euclidean space
to a Riemannian or Lorentzian surface. This is done by using the notion of
complex-harmonic morphism between complex-Riemannian manifolds and showing how
these are given by bicomplex-holomorphic functions when the codomain is
one-bicomplex dimensional. By taking real slices, we recover well-known
compactifications for the three possible real cases. On the way, we discuss
some interesting conformal compactifications of complex-Riemannian manifolds by
interpreting them as bicomplex manifolds.
