Bounds for eigenvalue ratios of the Laplacian
For a bounded domain $\Omega$ with a piecewise smooth boundary in an
$n$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbf{R}^{n}$, we study eigenvalues of the
Dirichlet eigenvalue problem of the Laplacian. First we give a general
inequality for eigenvalues of the Laplacian. As an application, we study lower
order eigenvalues of the Laplacian and derive the ratios of lower order
eigenvalues of the Laplacian.
