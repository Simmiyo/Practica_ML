Totally geodesic submanifolds of the exceptional Riemannian symmetric
  spaces of rank 2
The present article is the final part of a series on the classification of
the totally geodesic submanifolds of the irreducible Riemannian symmetric
spaces of rank 2. After this problem has been solved for the 2-Grassmannians in
my previous papers cited in the present paper as [K1] and [K2], and for the
space SU(3)/SO(3) in [K3], Section 6, we now solve the classification for the
remaining irreducible Riemannian symmetric spaces of rank 2 and compact type:
SU(6)/Sp(3), SO(10)/U(5), E6/(U(1)*Spin(10)), E6/F4, G2/SO(4), SU(3), Sp(2) and
G2.
  Similarly as for the spaces already investigated in the earlier papers, it
turns out that for many of the spaces investigated here, the earlier
classification of the maximal totally geodesic submanifolds of Riemannian
symmetric spaces by Chen and Nagano ([CN], Paragraph 9) is incomplete. In
particular, in the spaces Sp(2), G2/SO(4) and G2, there exist maximal totally
geodesic submanifolds, isometric to 2- or 3-dimensional spheres, which have a
"skew" position in the ambient space in the sense that their geodesic diameter
is strictly larger than the geodesic diameter of the ambient space. They are
all missing from [CN].
