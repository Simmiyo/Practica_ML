Spin structures on the Seiberg-Witten moduli spaces
Let $M$ be an oriented closed 4-manifold and $\cL$ be a $spin^c$ structure on
$M$. In this paper we prove that under a suitable condition the Seiberg-Witten
moduli space has a canonical spin structure and its spin bordism class is an
invariant for $M$. We show that the invariant for $M=#_{j=1}^l M_j$ is not
zero, where each $M_j$ is a $K3$ surface or a product of two oriented closed
surfaces with odd genus and $l$ is 2 or 3. As a corollary, we obtain the
adjunction inequality for $M$. Moreover we show that $M # N$ does not admit
Einstein metric for some $N$ with $b^+(N)=0$.
