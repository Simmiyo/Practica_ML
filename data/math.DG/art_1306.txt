A note on two-dimensional minimal surface graphs in R^n and a theorem of
  Bernstein-Liouville type
Using Schauder's theory for linear elliptic partial differential equations in
two independent variables and fundamental estimates for univalent mappings due
to E. Heinz we establish an upper bound of the Gaussian curvature of
two-dimensional minimal surface graphs in R^n. This leads us to a theorem of
Bernstein-Liouville type.
