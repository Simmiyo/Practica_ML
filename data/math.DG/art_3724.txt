On the equivariant implicit function theorem with low regularity and
  applications to geometric variational problems
We prove an implicit function theorem for functions on infinite-dimensional
Banach manifolds, invariant under the (local) action of a finite dimensional
Lie group. Motivated by some geometric variational problems, we consider group
actions that are not necessarily differentiable everywhere, but only on some
dense subset. Applications are discussed in the context of harmonic maps,
closed (pseudo-)Riemannian geodesics, and constant mean curvature
hypersurfaces.
