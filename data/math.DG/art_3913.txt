Cubic and Quartic integrals for geodesic flow on 2-torus via system of
  Hydrodynamic type
In this paper we deal with the classical question of existence of polynomial
in momenta integrals for geodesic flows on the 2-torus. For the quasi-linear
system on coefficients of the polynomial integral we consider the region (so
called elliptic regions) where there are complex-conjugate eigenvalues. We show
that for quartic integrals in the other two eigenvalues are real and genuinely
nonlinear. This observation together with the property of the system to be Rich
(Semi-Hamiltonian) enables us to classify elliptic regions completely. The case
of complex-conjugate eigenvalues for the system corresponding to the integral
of degree 3 is done similarly. These results show that if new integrable
examples exist they could be found only within the region of Hyperbolicity of
the quasi-linear system.
