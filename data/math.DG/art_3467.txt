A remark on Einstein warped products
We prove triviality results for Einstein warped products with non-compact
bases. These extend previous work by D.-S. Kim and Y.-H. Kim. The proof, from
the viewpoint of "quasi-Einstein manifolds" introduced by J. Case, Y.-S. Shu
and G. Wei, rely on maximum principles at infinity and Liouville-type theorems.
