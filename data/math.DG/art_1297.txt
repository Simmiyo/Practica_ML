On the origin of the BV operator on odd symplectic supermanifolds
Differential forms on an odd symplectic manifold form a bicomplex: one
differential is the wedge product with the symplectic form and the other is de
Rham differential. In the corresponding spectral sequence the next differential
turns out to be the Batalin-Vilkoviski operator.
