The Three Gap Theorem and Riemannian Geometry
The classical Three Gap Theorem asserts that for a natural number n and a
real number p, there are at most three distinct distances between consecutive
elements in the subset of [0,1) consisting of the reductions modulo 1 of the
first n multiples of p. Regarding it as a statement about rotations of the
circle, we find results in a similar spirit pertaining to isometries of compact
Riemannian manifolds and the distribution of points along their geodesics.
