Special Isothermic Surfaces and Solitons
We establish a correspondence between Darboux's special isothermic surfaces
of type (A,0,C,D) and the solutions of the second order PDE :
u\Delta(u)-|\nabla(u)|^{2}+\Phi^{4}=s, s \in R. We then use the classical
Darboux transformation for isothermic surfaces to construct a B\"acklund
transformation for this equation and prove a superposition formula for its
solutions. As an application we discuss 1 and 2-soliton solutions and the
corresponding surfaces.
