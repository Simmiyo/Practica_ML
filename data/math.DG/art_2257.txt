Pseudo focal points along Lorentzian geodesics and Morse index
Given a Lorentzian manifold $(M,g)$, a geodesic $\gamma$ in $M$ and a
timelike Jacobi field $\mathcal Y$ along $\gamma$, we introduce a special class
of instants along $\gamma$ that we call $\mathcal Y$-pseudo conjugate (or focal
relatively to some initial orthogonal submanifold). We prove that the $\mathcal
Y$-pseudo conjugate instants form a finite set, and their number equals the
Morse index of (a suitable restriction of) the index form. This gives a
Riemannian-like Morse index theorem. As special cases of the theory, we will
consider geodesics in stationary and static Lorentzian manifolds, where the
Jacobi field $\mathcal Y$ is obtained as the restriction of a globally defined
timelike Killing vector field.
