A new look at Condition A
Ozeki and Takeuchi \cite[I]{OT} introduced the notion of Condition A and
Condition B to construct two classes of inhomogeneous isoparametric
hypersurfaces with four principal curvatures in spheres, which were later
generalized by Ferus, Karcher and M\"unzner to many more examples via the
Clifford representations; we will refer to these examples of Ozeki and Takeuchi
and of Ferus, Karcher and M\"unzner collectively as OT-FKM type throughout the
paper. Dorfmeister and Neher \cite{DN} then employed isoparametric triple
systems \cite{DN1}, which are algebraic in nature, to prove that Condition A
alone implies the isoparametric hypersurface is of OT-FKM type. Their proof for
the case of multiplicity pairs $\{3,4\}$ and $\{7,8\}$ rests on a fairly
involved algebraic classification result \cite{Mc} about composition triples.
  In light of the classification \cite{CCJ} that leaves only the four
exceptional multiplicity pairs $\{4,5\},\{3,4\},\{7,8\}$ and $\{6,9\}$
unsettled, it appears that Condition A may hold the key to the classification
when the multiplicity pairs are $\{3,4\}$ and $\{7,8\}$. Thus Condition A
deserves to be scrutinized and understood more thoroughly from different
angles.
  In this paper, we give a fairly short and rather straightforward proof of the
result of Dorfmeister and Neher, with emphasis on the multiplicity pairs
$\{3,4\}$ and $\{7,8\}$, based on more geometric considerations. We make it
explicit and apparent that the octonian algebra governs the underlying
isoparametric structure.
