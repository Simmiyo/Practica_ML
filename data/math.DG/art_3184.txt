Geometric realizations of Kaehler and of para-Kaehler curvature models
We show that every Kaehler algebraic curvature tensor is geometrically
realizable by a Kaehler manifold of constant scalar curvature. We also show
that every para-Kaehler algebraic curvature tensor is geometrically realizable
by a para-Kaehler manifold of constant scalar curvature
