Conformal isosystolic inequality of Bieberbach 3-manifolds
The systole of a compact non simply connected Riemannian manifold is the
smallest length of a non-contractible closed curve ; the systolic ratio is the
quotient $(\mathrm{systole})^n/\mathrm{volume}$. Its supremum, over the set of
all Riemannian metrics, is known to be finite for a large class of manifolds,
including aspherical manifolds.
  We study a singular metric $g_0$ which has a better systolic ratio than all
flat metrics on $3$-dimensional non-orientable Bieberbach manifolds (introduced
in [El-La08]), and prove that it is extremal in its conformal class.
