Weil-Petersson geometry of Teichmuller-Coxeter complex and its finite
  rank property
We construct a Weil-Petersson geodesic completion of Teichmuller space
through the formalism of Coxeter complex with the Teichmuller space as its
non-linear non-homogeneous fundamental domain. We show that the metric and
geodesic completions both satisfy a finite rank property, demonstrating a
similarity with the non-compact symmetric spaces of semi-simple Lie groups.
