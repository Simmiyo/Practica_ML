Volume Growth and Curvature Decay of Positively Curved Kähler
  manifolds
In this paper we obtain three results concerning the geometry of complete
noncompact positively curved K\"{a}hler manifolds at infinity. The first one
states that the order of volume growth of a complete noncompact K\"{a}hler
manifold with positive bisectional curvature is at least half of the real
dimension (i.e., the complex dimension). The second one states that the
curvature of a complete noncompact K\"{a}hler manifold with positive
bisectional curvature decays at least linearly in the average sense. The third
result is concerned with the relation between the volume growth and the
curvature decay. We prove that the curvature decay of a complete noncompact
K\"{a}hler manifold with nonnegative curvature operator and with the maximal
volume growth is precisely quadratic in certain average sense.
