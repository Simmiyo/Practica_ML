Homogeneous Special Geometry
Motivated by the physical concept of special geometry two mathematical
constructions are studied, which relate real hypersurfaces to tube domains and
complex Lagrangean cones respectively. Me\-thods are developed for the
classification of homogeneous Riemannian hypersurfaces and for the
classification of linear transitive reductive algebraic group actions on pseudo
Riemannian hypersurfaces. The theory is applied to the case of cubic
hypersurfaces, which is the case most relevant to special geometry, obtaining
the solution of the two classification problems and the description of the
corresponding homogeneous special K\"ahler manifolds.
