Surgery and the Spectrum of the Dirac Operator
We show that for generic Riemannian metrics on a simply-connected closed spin
manifold of dimension at least 5 the dimension of the space of harmonic spinors
is no larger than it must be by the index theorem. The same result holds for
periodic fundamental groups of odd order.
  The proof is based on a surgery theorem for the Dirac spectrum which says
that if one performs surgery of codimension at least 3 on a closed Riemannian
spin manifold, then the Dirac spectrum changes arbitrarily little provided the
metric on the manifold after surgery is chosen properly.
