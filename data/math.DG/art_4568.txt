Regularity for Harmonic - Einstein Equation
We establish a regularity theorem for the Harmonic - Einstein Equation. As a
byproduct of the local regularity, we also have a compactness theorem on
Harmonic - Einstein equation. The method is mainly the Moser iteration
technique which has been used and developed by \cite{BKN89}, \cite{Tian90},
\cite{TV05a} and others.
