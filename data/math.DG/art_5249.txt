The Taylor Expansion of the Exponential Map and Geometric Applications
In this work we consider the Taylor expansion of the exponential map of a
submanifold immersed in R^n up to order three, in order to introduce the
concepts of lateral and frontal deviation. We compute the directions of extreme
lateral and frontal deviation for surfaces in R^3. Also we compute, by using
the Taylor expansion, the directions of high contact with hyperspheres of a
surface immersed in R^4 and the asymptotic directions of a surface immersed in
R^5.
