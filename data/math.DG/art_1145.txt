No skew branes on non-degenerate hyperquadrics
We show that non-degenerate hyperquadrics in R^{n+2} admit no skew branes.
Stated more traditionally, a compact codimension-one immersed submanifold of a
non-degenerate hyperquadric of euclidean space must have parallel tangent
spaces at two distinct points. Similar results have been proven by others, but
(except for ellipsoids in R^3) always under C^2 smoothness and genericity
assumptions. We use neither assumption here.
