Generalized Landau-Lifshitz Equation into $S^n$
In this paper, a type of integrable evolution equation--the generalized
Landau-Lifshitz equation into $S^n$ is considered. We deal with this equation
from a geometric point of view by rewriting it in a geometric form. Through the
geometric energy method, we show the global well-posedness of the corresponding
Cauchy problem.
