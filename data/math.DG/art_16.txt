Geometric Zeta Functions, $L^2$-Theory, and Compact Shimura Manifolds
We define geometric zeta functions for locally symmetric spaces as
generalizations of the zeta functions of Ruelle and Selberg. As a special value
at zero we obtain the Reidemeister torsion of the manifold. For hermitian
spaces these zeta functions have as special value the quotient of the
holomorphic torsion of Ray and Singer and the holomorphic $L^2$-torsion, where
the latter is defined via the $L^2$-theory of Atiyah. For higher fundamental
rank twisted torsion numbers appear.
