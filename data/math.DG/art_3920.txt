A restriction for singularities on collapsing orbifolds
An orbifold $X$ is locally homeomorphic to $G_x\backslash B_r(0)$, where
$G_x$ is a finite group acting on $B_r(0)\subset{\mathbb R}^n$, so that
$G_x(0)=0$. For collapsing orbifolds with isolated singularities, we show there
is a uniform bound in $|G_x|$.
