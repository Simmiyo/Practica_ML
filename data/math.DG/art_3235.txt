Riemannian submersions from simple, compact Lie groups
In this paper we construct infinitely many examples of a Riemannian
submersion from a simple, compact Lie group $G$ with bi-invariant metric onto a
smooth manifold that cannot be a quotient of $G$ by a group action. This
partially addresses a question of K. Grove's about Riemannian submersions from
Lie groups.
