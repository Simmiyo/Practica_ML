Moduli space of Fedosov structures
We consider the space of germs of Fedosov structures at a point, together
with the group of origin-preserving diffeomorphisms acting on it. We calculate
dimensions of moduli spaces of $k$-jets of generic structures and construct
Poincar\'e series. It is shown to be a rational function.
