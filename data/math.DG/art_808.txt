Splitting theorems in presence of an irrotational vector field
New splitting theorems in a semi-Riemannian manifold which admits an
irrotational vector field (not necessarily a gradient) with some suitable
properties are obtained. According to the extras hypothesis assumed on the
vector field, we can get twisted, warped or direct decompositions. Some
applications to Lorentzian manifold are shown and also $\mathbf{S}^{1}\times L$
type decomposition is treated.
