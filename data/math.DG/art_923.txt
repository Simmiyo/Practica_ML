An embedded genus-one helicoid
There exists a properly embedded minimal surface of genus one with one end.
The end is asymptotic to the end of the helicoid. This genus one helicoid is
constructed as the limit of a continuous one-parameter family of screw-motion
invariant minimal surfaces--also asymptotic to the helicoid--that have genus
equal to one in the quotient.
