Kahler manifolds with Ricci curvature lower bound
On Kahler manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded from below, we establish
some theorems which are counterparts of some classical theorems in Riemannian
geometry, for example, Bishop-Gromov's relative volume comparison,
Bonnet-Meyers theorem, and Yau's gradient estimate for positive harmonic
functions. The tool is a Bochner type formula reflecting the Kahler structure.
