CMC-surfaces, flat structures and umbilical points
A short proof of the Caratheodory conjecture about index of an isolated
umbilic on the convex 2-dimensional sphere is suggested. The argument is based
on the study of geodesic lines near cone-type singularity of a metric induced
by holomorphic quadratic differentials.
