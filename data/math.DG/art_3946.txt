A new bound on the Morse index of constant mean curvature tori of
  revolution in $\mathbb{S}^3$
In this work we give a new lower bound on the Morse index for constant mean
curvature tori of revolution immersed in the three-sphere $\mathbb{S}^3$, by
computing some explicit negative eigenvalues for the corresponding Jacobi
operator.
