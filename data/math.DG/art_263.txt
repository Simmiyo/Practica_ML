Extrema of curvature functionals on the space of metrics on 3-manifolds,
  II
Several rigidity results are proved for critical points of natural Riemannian
functionals on the space of metrics on 3-manifolds. Two of these results are as
follows. Let (N, g) be a complete Riemannian 3-manifold, satisfying one of the
following variational conditions:
  (i) (N, g) has non-negative scalar curvature and is a critical point for the
L^2 norm of the full curvature R among compact perturbations of (N, g).
  (ii) (N, g) has non-negative scalar curvature, a free isometric S^1 action,
and is a critical point of the L^2 norm of R among compact volume
non-increasing perturbations of (N, g) with non-negative scalar curvature.
  In either case, (N, g) is flat. The Schwarzschild metric (on the space-like
hypersurface) has an isometric S^1 action and satisfies the other assumptions
in (ii), showing that this result is sharp.
