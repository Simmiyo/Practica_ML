On the Geometry of Tangent Bundles with the Rescaled Metric
For a Riemannian manifold $M$, we determine some curvature properties of a
tangent bundle equipped with the rescaled metric.The main aim of this paper is
to give explicit formulae for the rescaled metric on $TM$, and investigate the
geodesics on the tangent bundle with respect to the rescaled Sasaki metric.
