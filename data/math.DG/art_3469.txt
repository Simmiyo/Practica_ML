On rotationally symmetric Kahler-Ricci solitons
In this note, using Calabi's method, we construct rotationally symmetric
Kahler-Ricci solitons on the total space of direct sum of fixed hermitian line
bundle and its projective compactification, where the curvature of hermitian
line bundle is Kahler-Einstein. These examples generalize the construction of
Koiso, Cao and Feldman-Ilmanen-Knopf.
