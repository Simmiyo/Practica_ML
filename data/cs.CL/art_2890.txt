Natural language processing (NLP) has recently gained much attention for
representing and analysing human language computationally. It has spread its
applications in various fields such as machine translation, email spam
detection, information extraction, summarization, medical, and question
answering etc. The paper distinguishes four phases by discussing different
levels of NLP and components of Natural Language Generation (NLG) followed by
presenting the history and evolution of NLP, state of the art presenting the
