From Incremental Meaning to Semantic Unit (phrase by phrase)
This paper describes an experimental approach to Detection of Minimal
Semantic Units and their Meaning (DiMSUM), explored within the framework of
SemEval 2016 Task 10. The approach is primarily based on a combination of word
embeddings and parserbased features, and employs unidirectional incremental
computation of compositional embeddings for multiword expressions.
