ChangeMyView Through Concessions: Do Concessions Increase Persuasion?
In discourse studies concessions are considered among those argumentative
strategies that increase persuasion. We aim to empirically test this hypothesis
by calculating the distribution of argumentative concessions in persuasive vs.
non-persuasive comments from the ChangeMyView subreddit. This constitutes a
challenging task since concessions are not always part of an argument. Drawing
from a theoretically-informed typology of concessions, we conduct an annotation
task to label a set of polysemous lexical markers as introducing an
argumentative concession or not and we observe their distribution in threads
that achieved and did not achieve persuasion. For the annotation, we used both
expert and novice annotators. With the ultimate goal of conducting the study on
large datasets, we present a self-training method to automatically identify
argumentative concessions using linguistically motivated features. We achieve a
moderate F1 of 57.4% on the development set and 46.0% on the test set via the
self-training method. These results are comparable to state of the art results
on similar tasks of identifying explicit discourse connective types from the
Penn Discourse Treebank. Our findings from the manual labeling and the
classification experiments indicate that the type of argumentative concessions
we investigated is almost equally likely to be used in winning and losing
arguments from the ChangeMyView dataset. While this result seems to contradict
theoretical assumptions, we provide some reasons for this discrepancy related
to the ChangeMyView subreddit.
