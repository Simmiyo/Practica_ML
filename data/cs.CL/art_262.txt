Building a Test Collection for Speech-Driven Web Retrieval
This paper describes a test collection (benchmark data) for retrieval systems
driven by spoken queries. This collection was produced in the subtask of the
NTCIR-3 Web retrieval task, which was performed in a TREC-style evaluation
workshop. The search topics and document collection for the Web retrieval task
were used to produce spoken queries and language models for speech recognition,
respectively. We used this collection to evaluate the performance of our
retrieval system. Experimental results showed that (a) the use of target
documents for language modeling and (b) enhancement of the vocabulary size in
speech recognition were effective in improving the system performance.
