Dataset for a Neural Natural Language Interface for Databases (NNLIDB)
Progress in natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDB) has been slow
mainly due to linguistic issues (such as language ambiguity) and domain
portability. Moreover, the lack of a large corpus to be used as a standard
benchmark has made data-driven approaches difficult to develop and compare. In
this paper, we revisit the problem of NLIDBs and recast it as a sequence
translation problem. To this end, we introduce a large dataset extracted from
the Stack Exchange Data Explorer website, which can be used for training neural
natural language interfaces for databases. We also report encouraging baseline
results on a smaller manually annotated test corpus, obtained using an
attention-based sequence-to-sequence neural network.
