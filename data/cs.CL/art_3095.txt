Is Structure Necessary for Modeling Argument Expectations in
  Distributional Semantics?
Despite the number of NLP studies dedicated to thematic fit estimation,
little attention has been paid to the related task of composing and updating
verb argument expectations. The few exceptions have mostly modeled this
phenomenon with structured distributional models, implicitly assuming a
similarly structured representation of events. Recent experimental evidence,
however, suggests that human processing system could also exploit an
unstructured "bag-of-arguments" type of event representation to predict
upcoming input. In this paper, we re-implement a traditional structured model
and adapt it to compare the different hypotheses concerning the degree of
structure in our event knowledge, evaluating their relative performance in the
task of the argument expectations update.
