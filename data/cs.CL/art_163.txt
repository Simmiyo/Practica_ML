A Complete WordNet1.5 to WordNet1.6 Mapping
We describe a robust approach for linking already existing lexical/semantic
hierarchies. We use a constraint satisfaction algorithm (relaxation labelling)
to select --among a set of candidates-- the node in a target taxonomy that
bests matches each node in a source taxonomy. In this paper we present the
complete mapping of the nominal, verbal, adjectival and adverbial parts of
WordNet 1.5 onto WordNet 1.6.
