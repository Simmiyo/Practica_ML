Entropy-based Pruning of Backoff Language Models
A criterion for pruning parameters from N-gram backoff language models is
developed, based on the relative entropy between the original and the pruned
model. It is shown that the relative entropy resulting from pruning a single
N-gram can be computed exactly and efficiently for backoff models. The relative
entropy measure can be expressed as a relative change in training set
perplexity. This leads to a simple pruning criterion whereby all N-grams that
change perplexity by less than a threshold are removed from the model.
Experiments show that a production-quality Hub4 LM can be reduced to 26% its
original size without increasing recognition error. We also compare the
approach to a heuristic pruning criterion by Seymore and Rosenfeld (1996), and
show that their approach can be interpreted as an approximation to the relative
entropy criterion. Experimentally, both approaches select similar sets of
N-grams (about 85% overlap), with the exact relative entropy criterion giving
marginally better performance.
