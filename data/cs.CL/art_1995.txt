Grounded Lexicon Acquisition - Case Studies in Spatial Language
This paper discusses grounded acquisition experiments of increasing
complexity. Humanoid robots acquire English spatial lexicons from robot tutors.
We identify how various spatial language systems, such as projective, absolute
and proximal can be learned. The proposed learning mechanisms do not rely on
direct meaning transfer or direct access to world models of interlocutors.
Finally, we show how multiple systems can be acquired at the same time.
