Survey on the Use of Typological Information in Natural Language
  Processing
In recent years linguistic typology, which classifies the world's languages
according to their functional and structural properties, has been widely used
to support multilingual NLP. While the growing importance of typological
information in supporting multilingual tasks has been recognised, no systematic
survey of existing typological resources and their use in NLP has been
published. This paper provides such a survey as well as discussion which we
hope will both inform and inspire future work in the area.
