Mapping the Dialog Act Annotations of the LEGO Corpus into the
  Communicative Functions of ISO 24617-2
In this paper we present strategies for mapping the dialog act annotations of
the LEGO corpus into the communicative functions of the ISO 24617-2 standard.
Using these strategies, we obtained an additional 347 dialogs annotated
according to the standard. This is particularly important given the reduced
amount of existing data in those conditions due to the recency of the standard.
Furthermore, these are dialogs from a widely explored corpus for dialog related
tasks. However, its dialog annotations have been neglected due to their high
domain-dependency, which renders them unuseful outside the context of the
corpus. Thus, through our mapping process, we both obtain more data annotated
according to a recent standard and provide useful dialog act annotations for a
widely explored corpus in the context of dialog research.
