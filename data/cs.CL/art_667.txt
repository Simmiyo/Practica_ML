Improving the Quality of MT Output using Novel Name Entity Translation
  Scheme
This paper presents a novel approach to machine translation by combining the
state of art name entity translation scheme. Improper translation of name
entities lapse the quality of machine translated output. In this work, name
entities are transliterated by using statistical rule based approach. This
paper describes the translation and transliteration of name entities from
English to Punjabi. We have experimented on four types of name entities which
are: Proper names, Location names, Organization names and miscellaneous.
Various rules for the purpose of syllabification have been constructed.
Transliteration of name entities is accomplished with the help of Probability
calculation. N-Gram probabilities for the extracted syllables have been
calculated using statistical machine translation toolkit MOSES.
