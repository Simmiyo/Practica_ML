How compatible are our discourse annotations? Insights from mapping
  RST-DT and PDTB annotations
Discourse-annotated corpora are an important resource for the community, but
they are often annotated according to different frameworks. This makes
comparison of the annotations difficult, thereby also preventing researchers
from searching the corpora in a unified way, or using all annotated data
jointly to train computational systems. Several theoretical proposals have
recently been made for mapping the relational labels of different frameworks to
each other, but these proposals have so far not been validated against existing
annotations. The two largest discourse relation annotated resources, the Penn
Discourse Treebank and the Rhetorical Structure Theory Discourse Treebank, have
however been annotated on the same text, allowing for a direct comparison of
the annotation layers. We propose a method for automatically aligning the
discourse segments, and then evaluate existing mapping proposals by comparing
the empirically observed against the proposed mappings. Our analysis highlights
the influence of segmentation on subsequent discourse relation labeling, and
shows that while agreement between frameworks is reasonable for explicit
relations, agreement on implicit relations is low. We identify several sources
of systematic discrepancies between the two annotation schemes and discuss
consequences of these discrepancies for future annotation and for the training
of automatic discourse relation labellers.
