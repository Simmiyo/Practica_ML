On the Challenges of Sentiment Analysis for Dynamic Events
With the proliferation of social media over the last decade, determining
people's attitude with respect to a specific topic, document, interaction or
events has fueled research interest in natural language processing and
introduced a new channel called sentiment and emotion analysis. For instance,
businesses routinely look to develop systems to automatically understand their
customer conversations by identifying the relevant content to enhance marketing
their products and managing their reputations. Previous efforts to assess
people's sentiment on Twitter have suggested that Twitter may be a valuable
resource for studying political sentiment and that it reflects the offline
political landscape. According to a Pew Research Center report, in January 2016
44 percent of US adults stated having learned about the presidential election
through social media. Furthermore, 24 percent reported use of social media
posts of the two candidates as a source of news and information, which is more
than the 15 percent who have used both candidates' websites or emails combined.
The first presidential debate between Trump and Hillary was the most tweeted
debate ever with 17.1 million tweets.
