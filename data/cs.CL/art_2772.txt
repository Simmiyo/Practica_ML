A Sentiment-and-Semantics-Based Approach for Emotion Detection in
  Textual Conversations
Emotions are physiological states generated in humans in reaction to internal
or external events. They are complex and studied across numerous fields
including computer science. As humans, on reading "Why don't you ever text me!"
we can either interpret it as a sad or angry emotion and the same ambiguity
exists for machines. Lack of facial expressions and voice modulations make
detecting emotions from text a challenging problem. However, as humans
increasingly communicate using text messaging applications, and digital agents
gain popularity in our society, it is essential that these digital agents are
emotion aware, and respond accordingly.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect emotions like happy, sad
or angry in textual conversations using an LSTM based Deep Learning model. Our
approach consists of semi-automated techniques to gather training data for our
model. We exploit advantages of semantic and sentiment based embeddings and
propose a solution combining both. Our work is evaluated on real-world
conversations and significantly outperforms traditional Machine Learning
baselines as well as other off-the-shelf Deep Learning models.
