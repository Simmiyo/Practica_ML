Learning to answer questions
We present an open-domain Question-Answering system that learns to answer
questions based on successful past interactions. We follow a pattern-based
approach to Answer-Extraction, where (lexico-syntactic) patterns that relate a
question to its answer are automatically learned and used to answer future
questions. Results show that our approach contributes to the system's best
performance when it is conjugated with typical Answer-Extraction strategies.
Moreover, it allows the system to learn with the answered questions and to
rectify wrong or unsolved past questions.
