Cross-Lingual Syntactic Transfer with Limited Resources
We describe a simple but effective method for cross-lingual syntactic
transfer of dependency parsers, in the scenario where a large amount of
translation data is not available. The method makes use of three steps: 1) a
method for deriving cross-lingual word clusters, which can then be used in a
multilingual parser; 2) a method for transferring lexical information from a
target language to source language treebanks; 3) a method for integrating these
steps with the density-driven annotation projection method of Rasooli and
Collins (2015). Experiments show improvements over the state-of-the-art in
several languages used in previous work, in a setting where the only source of
translation data is the Bible, a considerably smaller corpus than the Europarl
corpus used in previous work. Results using the Europarl corpus as a source of
translation data show additional improvements over the results of Rasooli and
Collins (2015). We conclude with results on 38 datasets from the Universal
Dependencies corpora.
