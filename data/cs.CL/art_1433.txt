Assigning personality/identity to a chatting machine for coherent
  conversation generation
Endowing a chatbot with personality or an identity is quite challenging but
critical to deliver more realistic and natural conversations. In this paper, we
address the issue of generating responses that are coherent to a pre-specified
agent profile. We design a model consisting of three modules: a profile
detector to decide whether a post should be responded using the profile and
which key should be addressed, a bidirectional decoder to generate responses
forward and backward starting from a selected profile value, and a position
detector that predicts a word position from which decoding should start given a
selected profile value. We show that general conversation data from social
media can be used to generate profile-coherent responses. Manual and automatic
evaluation shows that our model can deliver more coherent, natural, and
diversified responses.
