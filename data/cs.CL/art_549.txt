TempEval-3: Evaluating Events, Time Expressions, and Temporal Relations
We describe the TempEval-3 task which is currently in preparation for the
SemEval-2013 evaluation exercise. The aim of TempEval is to advance research on
temporal information processing. TempEval-3 follows on from previous TempEval
events, incorporating: a three-part task structure covering event, temporal
expression and temporal relation extraction; a larger dataset; and single
overall task quality scores.
