Learning Transformation Rules to Find Grammatical Relations
Grammatical relationships are an important level of natural language
processing. We present a trainable approach to find these relationships through
transformation sequences and error-driven learning. Our approach finds
grammatical relationships between core syntax groups and bypasses much of the
parsing phase. On our training and test set, our procedure achieves 63.6%
recall and 77.3% precision (f-score = 69.8).
