Fast k-best Sentence Compression
A popular approach to sentence compression is to formulate the task as a
constrained optimization problem and solve it with integer linear programming
(ILP) tools. Unfortunately, dependence on ILP may make the compressor
prohibitively slow, and thus approximation techniques have been proposed which
are often complex and offer a moderate gain in speed. As an alternative
solution, we introduce a novel compression algorithm which generates k-best
compressions relying on local deletion decisions. Our algorithm is two orders
of magnitude faster than a recent ILP-based method while producing better
compressions. Moreover, an extensive evaluation demonstrates that the quality
of compressions does not degrade much as we move from single best to top-five
results.
