Gibberish Semantics: How Good is Russian Twitter in Word Semantic
  Similarity Task?
The most studied and most successful language models were developed and
evaluated mainly for English and other close European languages, such as
French, German, etc. It is important to study applicability of these models to
other languages. The use of vector space models for Russian was recently
studied for multiple corpora, such as Wikipedia, RuWac, lib.ru. These models
were evaluated against word semantic similarity task. For our knowledge Twitter
was not considered as a corpus for this task, with this work we fill the gap.
Results for vectors trained on Twitter corpus are comparable in accuracy with
other single-corpus trained models, although the best performance is currently
achieved by combination of multiple corpora.
