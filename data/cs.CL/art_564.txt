Identification of Fertile Translations in Medical Comparable Corpora: a
  Morpho-Compositional Approach
This paper defines a method for lexicon in the biomedical domain from
comparable corpora. The method is based on compositional translation and
exploits morpheme-level translation equivalences. It can generate translations
for a large variety of morphologically constructed words and can also generate
'fertile' translations. We show that fertile translations increase the overall
quality of the extracted lexicon for English to French translation.
