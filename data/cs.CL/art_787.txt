Mapping the Economic Crisis: Some Preliminary Investigations
In this paper we describe our contribution to the PoliInformatics 2014
Challenge on the 2007-2008 financial crisis. We propose a state of the art
technique to extract information from texts and provide different
representations, giving first a static overview of the domain and then a
dynamic representation of its main evolutions. We show that this strategy
provides a practical solution to some recent theories in social sciences that
are facing a lack of methods and tools to automatically extract information
from natural language texts.
