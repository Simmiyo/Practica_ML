Revisiting the Hierarchical Multiscale LSTM
Hierarchical Multiscale LSTM (Chung et al., 2016a) is a state-of-the-art
language model that learns interpretable structure from character-level input.
Such models can provide fertile ground for (cognitive) computational
linguistics studies. However, the high complexity of the architecture, training
procedure and implementations might hinder its applicability. We provide a
detailed reproduction and ablation study of the architecture, shedding light on
some of the potential caveats of re-purposing complex deep-learning
architectures. We further show that simplifying certain aspects of the
architecture can in fact improve its performance. We also investigate the
linguistic units (segments) learned by various levels of the model, and argue
that their quality does not correlate with the overall performance of the model
on language modeling.
