Fast Approach to Build an Automatic Sentiment Annotator for Legal Domain
  using Transfer Learning
This study proposes a novel way of identifying the sentiment of the phrases
used in the legal domain. The added complexity of the language used in law, and
the inability of the existing systems to accurately predict the sentiments of
words in law are the main motivations behind this study. This is a transfer
learning approach, which can be used for other domain adaptation tasks as well.
The proposed methodology achieves an improvement of over 6\% compared to the
source model's accuracy in the legal domain.
