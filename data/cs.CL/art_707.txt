Hrebs and Cohesion Chains as similar tools for semantic text properties
  research
In this study it is proven that the Hrebs used in Denotation analysis of
texts and Cohesion Chains (defined as a fusion between Lexical Chains and
Coreference Chains) represent similar linguistic tools. This result gives us
the possibility to extend to Cohesion Chains (CCs) some important indicators
as, for example the Kernel of CCs, the topicality of a CC, text concentration,
CC-diffuseness and mean diffuseness of the text. Let us mention that nowhere in
the Lexical Chains or Coreference Chains literature these kinds of indicators
are introduced and used since now. Similarly, some applications of CCs in the
study of a text (as for example segmentation or summarization of a text) could
be realized starting from hrebs. As an illustration of the similarity between
Hrebs and CCs a detailed analyze of the poem "Lacul" by Mihai Eminescu is
given.
