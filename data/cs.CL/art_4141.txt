EmotionX-DLC: Self-Attentive BiLSTM for Detecting Sequential Emotions in
  Dialogue
In this paper, we propose a self-attentive bidirectional long short-term
memory (SA-BiLSTM) network to predict multiple emotions for the EmotionX
challenge. The BiLSTM exhibits the power of modeling the word dependencies, and
extracting the most relevant features for emotion classification. Building on
top of BiLSTM, the self-attentive network can model the contextual dependencies
between utterances which are helpful for classifying the ambiguous emotions. We
achieve 59.6 and 55.0 unweighted accuracy scores in the \textit{Friends} and
the \textit{EmotionPush} test sets, respectively.
