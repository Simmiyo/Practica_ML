Style Transfer Through Multilingual and Feedback-Based Back-Translation
Style transfer is the task of transferring an attribute of a sentence (e.g.,
formality) while maintaining its semantic content. The key challenge in style
transfer is to strike a balance between the competing goals, one to preserve
meaning and the other to improve the style transfer accuracy. Prior research
has identified that the task of meaning preservation is generally harder to
attain and evaluate. This paper proposes two extensions of the state-of-the-art
style transfer models aiming at improving the meaning preservation in style
transfer. Our evaluation shows that these extensions help to ground meaning
better while improving the transfer accuracy.
