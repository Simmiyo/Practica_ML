A Bit of Progress in Language Modeling
In the past several years, a number of different language modeling
improvements over simple trigram models have been found, including caching,
higher-order n-grams, skipping, interpolated Kneser-Ney smoothing, and
clustering. We present explorations of variations on, or of the limits of, each
of these techniques, including showing that sentence mixture models may have
more potential. While all of these techniques have been studied separately,
they have rarely been studied in combination. We find some significant
interactions, especially with smoothing and clustering techniques. We compare a
combination of all techniques together to a Katz smoothed trigram model with no
count cutoffs. We achieve perplexity reductions between 38% and 50% (1 bit of
entropy), depending on training data size, as well as a word error rate
reduction of 8.9%. Our perplexity reductions are perhaps the highest reported
compared to a fair baseline. This is the extended version of the paper; it
contains additional details and proofs, and is designed to be a good
introduction to the state of the art in language modeling.
