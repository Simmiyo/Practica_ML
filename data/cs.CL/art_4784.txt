Deep contextualized word representations for detecting sarcasm and irony
Predicting context-dependent and non-literal utterances like sarcastic and
ironic expressions still remains a challenging task in NLP, as it goes beyond
linguistic patterns, encompassing common sense and shared knowledge as crucial
components. To capture complex morpho-syntactic features that can usually serve
as indicators for irony or sarcasm across dynamic contexts, we propose a model
that uses character-level vector representations of words, based on ELMo. We
test our model on 7 different datasets derived from 3 different data sources,
providing state-of-the-art performance in 6 of them, and otherwise offering
competitive results.
