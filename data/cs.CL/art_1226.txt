Grounding the Lexical Sets of Causative-Inchoative Verbs with Word
  Embedding
Lexical sets contain the words filling the argument positions of a verb in
one of its senses. They can be grounded empirically through their automatic
extraction from corpora. The purpose of this paper is demonstrating that their
vector representation based on word embedding provides insights onto many
linguistic phenomena, and in particular about verbs undergoing the
causative-inchoative alternation. A first experiment aims at investigating the
internal structure of the sets, which are known to be radial and continuous
categories cognitively. A second experiment shows that the distance between the
subject set and object set is correlated with a semantic factor, namely the
spontaneity of the verb.
