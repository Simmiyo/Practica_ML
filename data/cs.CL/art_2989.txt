Debbie, the Debate Bot of the Future
Chatbots are a rapidly expanding application of dialogue systems with
companies switching to bot services for customer support, and new applications
for users interested in casual conversation. One style of casual conversation
is argument, many people love nothing more than a good argument. Moreover,
there are a number of existing corpora of argumentative dialogues, annotated
for agreement and disagreement, stance, sarcasm and argument quality. This
paper introduces Debbie, a novel arguing bot, that selects arguments from
conversational corpora, and aims to use them appropriately in context. We
present an initial working prototype of Debbie, with some preliminary
evaluation and describe future work.
