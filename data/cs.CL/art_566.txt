Gender identity and lexical variation in social media
We present a study of the relationship between gender, linguistic style, and
social networks, using a novel corpus of 14,000 Twitter users. Prior
quantitative work on gender often treats this social variable as a female/male
binary; we argue for a more nuanced approach. By clustering Twitter users, we
find a natural decomposition of the dataset into various styles and topical
interests. Many clusters have strong gender orientations, but their use of
linguistic resources sometimes directly conflicts with the population-level
language statistics. We view these clusters as a more accurate reflection of
the multifaceted nature of gendered language styles. Previous corpus-based work
has also had little to say about individuals whose linguistic styles defy
population-level gender patterns. To identify such individuals, we train a
statistical classifier, and measure the classifier confidence for each
individual in the dataset. Examining individuals whose language does not match
the classifier's model for their gender, we find that they have social networks
that include significantly fewer same-gender social connections and that, in
general, social network homophily is correlated with the use of same-gender
language markers. Pairing computational methods and social theory thus offers a
new perspective on how gender emerges as individuals position themselves
relative to audiences, topics, and mainstream gender norms.
