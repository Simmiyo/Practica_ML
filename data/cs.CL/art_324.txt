Using Description Logics for Recognising Textual Entailment
The aim of this paper is to show how we can handle the Recognising Textual
Entailment (RTE) task by using Description Logics (DLs). To do this, we propose
a representation of natural language semantics in DLs inspired by existing
representations in first-order logic. But our most significant contribution is
the definition of two novel inference tasks: A-Box saturation and subgraph
detection which are crucial for our approach to RTE.
