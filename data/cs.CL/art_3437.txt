Gender Aware Spoken Language Translation Applied to English-Arabic
Spoken Language Translation (SLT) is becoming more widely used and becoming a
communication tool that helps in crossing language barriers. One of the
challenges of SLT is the translation from a language without gender agreement
to a language with gender agreement such as English to Arabic. In this paper,
we introduce an approach to tackle such limitation by enabling a Neural Machine
Translation system to produce gender-aware translation. We show that NMT system
can model the speaker/listener gender information to produce gender-aware
translation. We propose a method to generate data used in adapting a NMT system
to produce gender-aware. The proposed approach can achieve significant
improvement of the translation quality by 2 BLEU points.
