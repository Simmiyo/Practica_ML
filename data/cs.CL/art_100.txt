ATLAS: A flexible and extensible architecture for linguistic annotation
We describe a formal model for annotating linguistic artifacts, from which we
derive an application programming interface (API) to a suite of tools for
manipulating these annotations. The abstract logical model provides for a range
of storage formats and promotes the reuse of tools that interact through this
API. We focus first on ``Annotation Graphs,'' a graph model for annotations on
linear signals (such as text and speech) indexed by intervals, for which
efficient database storage and querying techniques are applicable. We note how
a wide range of existing annotated corpora can be mapped to this annotation
graph model. This model is then generalized to encompass a wider variety of
linguistic ``signals,'' including both naturally occuring phenomena (as
recorded in images, video, multi-modal interactions, etc.), as well as the
derived resources that are increasingly important to the engineering of natural
language processing systems (such as word lists, dictionaries, aligned
bilingual corpora, etc.). We conclude with a review of the current efforts
towards implementing key pieces of this architecture.
