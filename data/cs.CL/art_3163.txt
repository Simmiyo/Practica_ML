Unsupervised Context-Sensitive Spelling Correction of English and Dutch
  Clinical Free-Text with Word and Character N-Gram Embeddings
We present an unsupervised context-sensitive spelling correction method for
clinical free-text that uses word and character n-gram embeddings. Our method
generates misspelling replacement candidates and ranks them according to their
semantic fit, by calculating a weighted cosine similarity between the
vectorized representation of a candidate and the misspelling context. To tune
the parameters of this model, we generate self-induced spelling error corpora.
We perform our experiments for two languages. For English, we greatly
outperform off-the-shelf spelling correction tools on a manually annotated
MIMIC-III test set, and counter the frequency bias of a noisy channel model,
showing that neural embeddings can be successfully exploited to improve upon
the state-of-the-art. For Dutch, we also outperform an off-the-shelf spelling
correction tool on manually annotated clinical records from the Antwerp
University Hospital, but can offer no empirical evidence that our method
counters the frequency bias of a noisy channel model in this case as well.
However, both our context-sensitive model and our implementation of the noisy
channel model obtain high scores on the test set, establishing a
state-of-the-art for Dutch clinical spelling correction with the noisy channel
model.
