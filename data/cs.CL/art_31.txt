A Computational Memory and Processing Model for Processing
This paper links prosody to the information in a text and how it is processed
by the speaker. It describes the operation and output of LOQ, a text-to-speech
implementation that includes a model of limited attention and working memory.
Attentional limitations are key. Varying the attentional parameter in the
simulations varies in turn what counts as given and new in a text, and
therefore, the intonational contours with which it is uttered. Currently, the
system produces prosody in three different styles: child-like, adult
expressive, and knowledgeable. This prosody also exhibits differences within
each style -- no two simulations are alike. The limited resource approach
captures some of the stylistic and individual variety found in natural prosody.
