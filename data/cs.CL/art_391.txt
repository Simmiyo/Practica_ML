Analyse en dépendances à l'aide des grammaires d'interaction
This article proposes a method to extract dependency structures from
phrase-structure level parsing with Interaction Grammars. Interaction Grammars
are a formalism which expresses interactions among words using a polarity
system. Syntactical composition is led by the saturation of polarities.
Interactions take place between constituents, but as grammars are lexicalized,
these interactions can be translated at the level of words. Dependency
relations are extracted from the parsing process: every dependency is the
consequence of a polarity saturation. The dependency relations we obtain can be
seen as a refinement of the usual dependency tree. Generally speaking, this
work sheds new light on links between phrase structure and dependency parsing.
