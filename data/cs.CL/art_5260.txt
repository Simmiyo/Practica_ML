Conversational Intent Understanding for Passengers in Autonomous
  Vehicles
Understanding passenger intents and extracting relevant slots are important
building blocks towards developing a contextual dialogue system responsible for
handling certain vehicle-passenger interactions in autonomous vehicles (AV).
When the passengers give instructions to AMIE (Automated-vehicle Multimodal
In-cabin Experience), the agent should parse such commands properly and trigger
the appropriate functionality of the AV system. In our AMIE scenarios, we
describe usages and support various natural commands for interacting with the
vehicle. We collected a multimodal in-cabin data-set with multi-turn dialogues
between the passengers and AMIE using a Wizard-of-Oz scheme. We explored
various recent Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) based techniques and built our
own hierarchical models to recognize passenger intents along with relevant
slots associated with the action to be performed in AV scenarios. Our
experimental results achieved F1-score of 0.91 on utterance-level intent
recognition and 0.96 on slot extraction models.
