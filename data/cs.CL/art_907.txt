Prediction Using Note Text: Synthetic Feature Creation with word2vec
word2vec affords a simple yet powerful approach of extracting quantitative
variables from unstructured textual data. Over half of healthcare data is
unstructured and therefore hard to model without involved expertise in data
engineering and natural language processing. word2vec can serve as a bridge to
quickly gather intelligence from such data sources.
  In this study, we ran 650 megabytes of unstructured, medical chart notes from
the Providence Health & Services electronic medical record through word2vec. We
used two different approaches in creating predictive variables and tested them
on the risk of readmission for patients with COPD (Chronic Obstructive Lung
Disease). As a comparative benchmark, we ran the same test using the LACE risk
model (a single score based on length of stay, acuity, comorbid conditions, and
emergency department visits).
  Using only free text and mathematical might, we found word2vec comparable to
LACE in predicting the risk of readmission of COPD patients.
