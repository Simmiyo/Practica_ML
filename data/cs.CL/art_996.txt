Reflections on Sentiment/Opinion Analysis
In this paper, we described possible directions for deeper understanding,
helping bridge the gap between psychology / cognitive science and computational
approaches in sentiment/opinion analysis literature. We focus on the opinion
holder's underlying needs and their resultant goals, which, in a utilitarian
model of sentiment, provides the basis for explaining the reason a sentiment
valence is held. While these thoughts are still immature, scattered,
unstructured, and even imaginary, we believe that these perspectives might
suggest fruitful avenues for various kinds of future work.
