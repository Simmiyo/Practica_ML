Czech Text Document Corpus v 2.0
This paper introduces "Czech Text Document Corpus v 2.0", a collection of
text documents for automatic document classification in Czech language. It is
composed of the text documents provided by the Czech News Agency and is freely
available for research purposes at http://ctdc.kiv.zcu.cz/. This corpus was
created in order to facilitate a straightforward comparison of the document
classification approaches on Czech data. It is particularly dedicated to
evaluation of multi-label document classification approaches, because one
document is usually labelled with more than one label. Besides the information
about the document classes, the corpus is also annotated at the morphological
layer. This paper further shows the results of selected state-of-the-art
methods on this corpus to offer the possibility of an easy comparison with
these approaches.
