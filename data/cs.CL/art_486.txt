Ideogram Based Chinese Sentiment Word Orientation Computation
This paper presents a novel algorithm to compute sentiment orientation of
Chinese sentiment word. The algorithm uses ideograms which are a distinguishing
feature of Chinese language. The proposed algorithm can be applied to any
sentiment classification scheme. To compute a word's sentiment orientation
using the proposed algorithm, only the word itself and a precomputed character
ontology is required, rather than a corpus. The influence of three parameters
over the algorithm performance is analyzed and verified by experiment.
Experiment also shows that proposed algorithm achieves an F Measure of 85.02%
outperforming existing ideogram based algorithm.
