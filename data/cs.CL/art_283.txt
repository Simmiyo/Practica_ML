Proofing Tools Technology at Neurosoft S.A.
The aim of this paper is to present the R&D activities carried out at
Neurosoft S.A. regarding the development of proofing tools for Modern Greek.
Firstly, we focus on infrastructure issues that we faced during our initial
steps. Subsequently, we describe the most important insights of three proofing
tools developed by Neurosoft, i.e. the spelling checker, the hyphenator and the
thesaurus, outlining their efficiencies and inefficiencies. Finally, we discuss
some improvement ideas and give our future directions.
