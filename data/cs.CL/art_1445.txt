Acoustic data-driven lexicon learning based on a greedy pronunciation
  selection framework
Speech recognition systems for irregularly-spelled languages like English
normally require hand-written pronunciations. In this paper, we describe a
system for automatically obtaining pronunciations of words for which
pronunciations are not available, but for which transcribed data exists. Our
method integrates information from the letter sequence and from the acoustic
evidence. The novel aspect of the problem that we address is the problem of how
to prune entries from such a lexicon (since, empirically, lexicons with too
many entries do not tend to be good for ASR performance). Experiments on
various ASR tasks show that, with the proposed framework, starting with an
initial lexicon of several thousand words, we are able to learn a lexicon which
performs close to a full expert lexicon in terms of WER performance on test
data, and is better than lexicons built using G2P alone or with a pruning
criterion based on pronunciation probability.
