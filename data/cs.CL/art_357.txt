Constructing word similarities in Meroitic as an aid to decipherment
Meroitic is the still undeciphered language of the ancient civilization of
Kush. Over the years, various techniques for decipherment such as finding a
bilingual text or cognates from modern or other ancient languages in the Sudan
and surrounding areas has not been successful. Using techniques borrowed from
information theory and natural language statistics, similar words are paired
and attempts are made to use currently defined words to extract at least
partial meaning from unknown words.
