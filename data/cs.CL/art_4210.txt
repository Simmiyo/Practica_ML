A Formal Ontology-Based Classification of Lexemes and its Applications
The paper describes the enrichment of OntoSenseNet - a verb-centric lexical
resource for Indian Languages. A major contribution of this work is
preservation of an authentic Telugu dictionary by developing a computational
version of the same. It is important because native speakers can better
annotate the sense-types when both the word and its meaning are in Telugu.
Hence efforts are made to develop the aforementioned Telugu dictionary and
annotations are done manually. The manually annotated gold standard corpus
consists 8483 verbs, 253 adverbs and 1673 adjectives. Annotations are done by
native speakers according to defined annotation guidelines. In this paper, we
provide an overview of the annotation procedure and present the validation of
the developed resource through inter-annotator agreement. Additional words from
Telugu WordNet are added to our resource and are crowd-sourced for annotation.
The statistics are compared with the sense-annotated lexicon, our resource for
more insights.
