Language Acquisition in Computers
This project explores the nature of language acquisition in computers, guided
by techniques similar to those used in children. While existing natural
language processing methods are limited in scope and understanding, our system
aims to gain an understanding of language from first principles and hence
minimal initial input. The first portion of our system was implemented in Java
and is focused on understanding the morphology of language using bigrams. We
use frequency distributions and differences between them to define and
distinguish languages. English and French texts were analyzed to determine a
difference threshold of 55 before the texts are considered to be in different
languages, and this threshold was verified using Spanish texts. The second
portion of our system focuses on gaining an understanding of the syntax of a
language using a recursive method. The program uses one of two possible methods
to analyze given sentences based on either sentence patterns or surrounding
words. Both methods have been implemented in C++. The program is able to
understand the structure of simple sentences and learn new words. In addition,
we have provided some suggestions regarding future work and potential
extensions of the existing program.
