JSUT corpus: free large-scale Japanese speech corpus for end-to-end
  speech synthesis
Thanks to improvements in machine learning techniques including deep
learning, a free large-scale speech corpus that can be shared between academic
institutions and commercial companies has an important role. However, such a
corpus for Japanese speech synthesis does not exist. In this paper, we designed
a novel Japanese speech corpus, named the "JSUT corpus," that is aimed at
achieving end-to-end speech synthesis. The corpus consists of 10 hours of
reading-style speech data and its transcription and covers all of the main
pronunciations of daily-use Japanese characters. In this paper, we describe how
we designed and analyzed the corpus. The corpus is freely available online.
