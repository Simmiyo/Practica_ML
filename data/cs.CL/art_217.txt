Assessing System Agreement and Instance Difficulty in the Lexical Sample
  Tasks of Senseval-2
This paper presents a comparative evaluation among the systems that
participated in the Spanish and English lexical sample tasks of Senseval-2. The
focus is on pairwise comparisons among systems to assess the degree to which
they agree, and on measuring the difficulty of the test instances included in
these tasks.
