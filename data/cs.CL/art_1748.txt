Multi-Field Structural Decomposition for Question Answering
This paper presents a precursory yet novel approach to the question answering
task using structural decomposition. Our system first generates linguistic
structures such as syntactic and semantic trees from text, decomposes them into
multiple fields, then indexes the terms in each field. For each question, it
decomposes the question into multiple fields, measures the relevance score of
each field to the indexed ones, then ranks all documents by their relevance
scores and weights associated with the fields, where the weights are learned
through statistical modeling. Our final model gives an absolute improvement of
over 40% to the baseline approach using simple search for detecting documents
containing answers.
