Turning Speech Into Scripts
We describe an architecture for implementing spoken natural language dialogue
interfaces to semi-autonomous systems, in which the central idea is to
transform the input speech signal through successive levels of representation
corresponding roughly to linguistic knowledge, dialogue knowledge, and domain
knowledge. The final representation is an executable program in a simple
scripting language equivalent to a subset of Cshell. At each stage of the
translation process, an input is transformed into an output, producing as a
byproduct a "meta-output" which describes the nature of the transformation
performed. We show how consistent use of the output/meta-output distinction
permits a simple and perspicuous treatment of apparently diverse topics
including resolution of pronouns, correction of user misconceptions, and
optimization of scripts. The methods described have been concretely realized in
a prototype speech interface to a simulation of the Personal Satellite
Assistant.
