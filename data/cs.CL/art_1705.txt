An Event Network for Exploring Open Information
In this paper, an event network is presented for exploring open information,
where linguistic units about an event are organized for analysing. The process
is divided into three steps: document event detection, event network
construction and event network analysis. First, by implementing event detection
or tracking, documents are retrospectively (or on-line) organized into document
events. Secondly, for each of the document event, linguistic units are
extracted and combined into event networks. Thirdly, various analytic methods
are proposed for event network analysis. In our application methodologies are
presented for exploring open information.
