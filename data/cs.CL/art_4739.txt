NICT's Neural and Statistical Machine Translation Systems for the WMT18
  News Translation Task
This paper presents the NICT's participation to the WMT18 shared news
translation task. We participated in the eight translation directions of four
language pairs: Estonian-English, Finnish-English, Turkish-English and
Chinese-English. For each translation direction, we prepared state-of-the-art
statistical (SMT) and neural (NMT) machine translation systems. Our NMT systems
were trained with the transformer architecture using the provided parallel data
enlarged with a large quantity of back-translated monolingual data that we
generated with a new incremental training framework. Our primary submissions to
the task are the result of a simple combination of our SMT and NMT systems. Our
systems are ranked first for the Estonian-English and Finnish-English language
pairs (constraint) according to BLEU-cased.
