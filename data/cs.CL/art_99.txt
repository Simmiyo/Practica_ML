Bootstrapping a Tagged Corpus through Combination of Existing
  Heterogeneous Taggers
This paper describes a new method, Combi-bootstrap, to exploit existing
taggers and lexical resources for the annotation of corpora with new tagsets.
Combi-bootstrap uses existing resources as features for a second level machine
learning module, that is trained to make the mapping to the new tagset on a
very small sample of annotated corpus material. Experiments show that
Combi-bootstrap: i) can integrate a wide variety of existing resources, and ii)
achieves much higher accuracy (up to 44.7 % error reduction) than both the best
single tagger and an ensemble tagger constructed out of the same small training
sample.
