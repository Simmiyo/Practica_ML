Automatic derivation of domain terms and concept location based on the
  analysis of the identifiers
Developers express the meaning of the domain ideas in specifically selected
identifiers and comments that form the target implemented code. Software
maintenance requires knowledge and understanding of the encoded ideas. This
paper presents a way how to create automatically domain vocabulary. Knowledge
of domain vocabulary supports the comprehension of a specific domain for later
code maintenance or evolution. We present experiments conducted in two selected
domains: application servers and web frameworks. Knowledge of domain terms
enables easy localization of chunks of code that belong to a certain term. We
consider these chunks of code as "concepts" and their placement in the code as
"concept location". Application developers may also benefit from the obtained
domain terms. These terms are parts of speech that characterize a certain
concept. Concepts are encoded in "classes" (OO paradigm) and the obtained
vocabulary of terms supports the selection and the comprehension of the class'
appropriate identifiers. We measured the following software products with our
tool: JBoss, JOnAS, GlassFish, Tapestry, Google Web Toolkit and Echo2.
