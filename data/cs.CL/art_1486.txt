Data-driven Natural Language Generation: Paving the Road to Success
We argue that there are currently two major bottlenecks to the commercial use
of statistical machine learning approaches for natural language generation
(NLG): (a) The lack of reliable automatic evaluation metrics for NLG, and (b)
The scarcity of high quality in-domain corpora. We address the first problem by
thoroughly analysing current evaluation metrics and motivating the need for a
new, more reliable metric. The second problem is addressed by presenting a
novel framework for developing and evaluating a high quality corpus for NLG
training.
