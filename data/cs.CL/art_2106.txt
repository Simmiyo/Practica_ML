Semi-supervised knowledge extraction for detection of drugs and their
  effects
New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) are drugs that lay in a grey area of
legislation, since they are not internationally and officially banned, possibly
leading to their not prosecutable trade. The exacerbation of the phenomenon is
that NPS can be easily sold and bought online. Here, we consider large corpora
of textual posts, published on online forums specialized on drug discussions,
plus a small set of known substances and associated effects, which we call
seeds. We propose a semi-supervised approach to knowledge extraction, applied
to the detection of drugs (comprising NPS) and effects from the corpora under
investigation. Based on the very small set of initial seeds, the work
highlights how a contrastive approach and context deduction are effective in
detecting substances and effects from the corpora. Our promising results, which
feature a F1 score close to 0.9, pave the way for shortening the detection time
of new psychoactive substances, once these are discussed and advertised on the
Internet.
