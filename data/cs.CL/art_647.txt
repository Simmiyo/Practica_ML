Implementation of nlization framework for verbs, pronouns and
  determiners with eugene
UNL system is designed and implemented by a nonprofit organization, UNDL
Foundation at Geneva in 1999. UNL applications are application softwares that
allow end users to accomplish natural language tasks, such as translating,
summarizing, retrieving or extracting information, etc. Two major web based
application softwares are Interactive ANalyzer (IAN), which is a natural
language analysis system. It represents natural language sentences as semantic
networks in the UNL format. Other application software is dEep-to-sUrface
GENErator (EUGENE), which is an open-source interactive NLizer. It generates
natural language sentences out of semantic networks represented in the UNL
format. In this paper, NLization framework with EUGENE is focused, while using
UNL system for accomplishing the task of machine translation. In whole
NLization process, EUGENE takes a UNL input and delivers an output in natural
language without any human intervention. It is language-independent and has to
be parametrized to the natural language input through a dictionary and a
grammar, provided as separate interpretable files. In this paper, it is
explained that how UNL input is syntactically and semantically analyzed with
the UNL-NL T-Grammar for NLization of UNL sentences involving verbs, pronouns
and determiners for Punjabi natural language.
