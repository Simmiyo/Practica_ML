Integrating Weakly Supervised Word Sense Disambiguation into Neural
  Machine Translation
This paper demonstrates that word sense disambiguation (WSD) can improve
neural machine translation (NMT) by widening the source context considered when
modeling the senses of potentially ambiguous words. We first introduce three
adaptive clustering algorithms for WSD, based on k-means, Chinese restaurant
processes, and random walks, which are then applied to large word contexts
represented in a low-rank space and evaluated on SemEval shared-task data. We
then learn word vectors jointly with sense vectors defined by our best WSD
method, within a state-of-the-art NMT system. We show that the concatenation of
these vectors, and the use of a sense selection mechanism based on the weighted
average of sense vectors, outperforms several baselines including sense-aware
ones. This is demonstrated by translation on five language pairs. The
improvements are above one BLEU point over strong NMT baselines, +4% accuracy
over all ambiguous nouns and verbs, or +20% when scored manually over several
challenging words.
