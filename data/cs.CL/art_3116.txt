Bilingual Words and Phrase Mappings for Marathi and Hindi SMT
Lack of proper linguistic resources is the major challenges faced by the
Machine Translation system developments when dealing with the resource poor
languages. In this paper, we describe effective ways to utilize the lexical
resources to improve the quality of statistical machine translation. Our
research on the usage of lexical resources mainly focused on two ways, such as;
augmenting the parallel corpus with more vocabulary and to provide various word
forms. We have augmented the training corpus with various lexical resources
such as lexical words, function words, kridanta pairs and verb phrases. We have
described the case studies, evaluations and detailed error analysis for both
Marathi to Hindi and Hindi to Marathi machine translation systems. From the
evaluations we observed that, there is an incremental growth in the quality of
machine translation as the usage of various lexical resources increases.
Moreover, usage of various lexical resources helps to improve the coverage and
quality of machine translation where limited parallel corpus is available.
