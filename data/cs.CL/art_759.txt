Overview of Stemming Algorithms for Indian and Non-Indian Languages
Stemming is a pre-processing step in Text Mining applications as well as a
very common requirement of Natural Language processing functions. Stemming is
the process for reducing inflected words to their stem. The main purpose of
stemming is to reduce different grammatical forms / word forms of a word like
its noun, adjective, verb, adverb etc. to its root form. Stemming is widely
uses in Information Retrieval system and reduces the size of index files. We
can say that the goal of stemming is to reduce inflectional forms and sometimes
derivationally related forms of a word to a common base form. In this paper we
have discussed different stemming algorithm for non-Indian and Indian language,
methods of stemming, accuracy and errors.
