Leveraging Recurrent Neural Networks for Multimodal Recognition of
  Social Norm Violation in Dialog
Social norms are shared rules that govern and facilitate social interaction.
Violating such social norms via teasing and insults may serve to upend power
imbalances or, on the contrary reinforce solidarity and rapport in
conversation, rapport which is highly situated and context-dependent. In this
work, we investigate the task of automatically identifying the phenomena of
social norm violation in discourse. Towards this goal, we leverage the power of
recurrent neural networks and multimodal information present in the
interaction, and propose a predictive model to recognize social norm violation.
Using long-term temporal and contextual information, our model achieves an F1
score of 0.705. Implications of our work regarding developing a social-aware
agent are discussed.
