Hierarchical RNN for Information Extraction from Lawsuit Documents
Every lawsuit document contains the information about the party's claim,
court's analysis, decision and others, and all of this information are helpful
to understand the case better and predict the judge's decision on similar case
in the future. However, the extraction of these information from the document
is difficult because the language is too complicated and sentences varied at
length. We treat this problem as a task of sequence labeling, and this paper
presents the first research to extract relevant information from the civil
lawsuit document in China with the hierarchical RNN framework.
