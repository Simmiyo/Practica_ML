Are Emojis Predictable?
Emojis are ideograms which are naturally combined with plain text to visually
complement or condense the meaning of a message. Despite being widely used in
social media, their underlying semantics have received little attention from a
Natural Language Processing standpoint. In this paper, we investigate the
relation between words and emojis, studying the novel task of predicting which
emojis are evoked by text-based tweet messages. We train several models based
on Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) in this task. Our experimental
results show that our neural model outperforms two baselines as well as humans
solving the same task, suggesting that computational models are able to better
capture the underlying semantics of emojis.
