Discriminating between similar languages in Twitter using label
  propagation
Identifying the language of social media messages is an important first step
in linguistic processing. Existing models for Twitter focus on content
analysis, which is successful for dissimilar language pairs. We propose a label
propagation approach that takes the social graph of tweet authors into account
as well as content to better tease apart similar languages. This results in
state-of-the-art shared task performance of $76.63\%$, $1.4\%$ higher than the
top system.
