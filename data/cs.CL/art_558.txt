More than Word Frequencies: Authorship Attribution via Natural Frequency
  Zoned Word Distribution Analysis
With such increasing popularity and availability of digital text data,
authorships of digital texts can not be taken for granted due to the ease of
copying and parsing. This paper presents a new text style analysis called
natural frequency zoned word distribution analysis (NFZ-WDA), and then a basic
authorship attribution scheme and an open authorship attribution scheme for
digital texts based on the analysis. NFZ-WDA is based on the observation that
all authors leave distinct intrinsic word usage traces on texts written by them
and these intrinsic styles can be identified and employed to analyze the
authorship. The intrinsic word usage styles can be estimated through the
analysis of word distribution within a text, which is more than normal word
frequency analysis and can be expressed as: which groups of words are used in
the text; how frequently does each group of words occur; how are the
occurrences of each group of words distributed in the text. Next, the basic
authorship attribution scheme and the open authorship attribution scheme
provide solutions for both closed and open authorship attribution problems.
Through analysis and extensive experimental studies, this paper demonstrates
the efficiency of the proposed method for authorship attribution.
