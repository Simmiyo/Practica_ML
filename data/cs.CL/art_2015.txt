Entailment Relations on Distributions
In this paper we give an overview of partial orders on the space of
probability distributions that carry a notion of information content and serve
as a generalisation of the Bayesian order given in (Coecke and Martin, 2011).
We investigate what constraints are necessary in order to get a unique notion
of information content. These partial orders can be used to give an ordering on
words in vector space models of natural language meaning relating to the
contexts in which words are used, which is useful for a notion of entailment
and word disambiguation. The construction used also points towards a way to
create orderings on the space of density operators which allow a more
fine-grained study of entailment. The partial orders in this paper are directed
complete and form domains in the sense of domain theory.
