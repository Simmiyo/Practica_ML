A Corpus of English-Hindi Code-Mixed Tweets for Sarcasm Detection
Social media platforms like twitter and facebook have be- come two of the
largest mediums used by people to express their views to- wards different
topics. Generation of such large user data has made NLP tasks like sentiment
analysis and opinion mining much more important. Using sarcasm in texts on
social media has become a popular trend lately. Using sarcasm reverses the
meaning and polarity of what is implied by the text which poses challenge for
many NLP tasks. The task of sarcasm detection in text is gaining more and more
importance for both commer- cial and security services. We present the first
English-Hindi code-mixed dataset of tweets marked for presence of sarcasm and
irony where each token is also annotated with a language tag. We present a
baseline su- pervised classification system developed using the same dataset
which achieves an average F-score of 78.4 after using random forest classifier
and performing 10-fold cross validation.
