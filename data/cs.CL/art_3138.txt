Revisiting the Design Issues of Local Models for Japanese
  Predicate-Argument Structure Analysis
The research trend in Japanese predicate-argument structure (PAS) analysis is
shifting from pointwise prediction models with local features to global models
designed to search for globally optimal solutions. However, the existing global
models tend to employ only relatively simple local features; therefore, the
overall performance gains are rather limited. The importance of designing a
local model is demonstrated in this study by showing that the performance of a
sophisticated local model can be considerably improved with recent feature
embedding methods and a feature combination learning based on a neural network,
outperforming the state-of-the-art global models in $F_1$ on a common benchmark
dataset.
