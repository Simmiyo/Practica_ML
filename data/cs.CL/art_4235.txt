Linguistic Characteristics of Censorable Language on SinaWeibo
This paper investigates censorship from a linguistic perspective. We collect
a corpus of censored and uncensored posts on a number of topics, build a
classifier that predicts censorship decisions independent of discussion topics.
Our investigation reveals that the strongest linguistic indicator of censored
content of our corpus is its readability.
