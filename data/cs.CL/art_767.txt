Challenges in Persian Electronic Text Analysis
Farsi, also known as Persian, is the official language of Iran and Tajikistan
and one of the two main languages spoken in Afghanistan. Farsi enjoys a unified
Arabic script as its writing system. In this paper we briefly introduce the
writing standards of Farsi and highlight problems one would face when analyzing
Farsi electronic texts, especially during development of Farsi corpora
regarding to transcription and encoding of Farsi e-texts. The pointes mentioned
may sounds easy but they are crucial when developing and processing written
corpora of Farsi.
