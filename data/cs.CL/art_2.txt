Modelling Users, Intentions, and Structure in Spoken Dialog
We outline how utterances in dialogs can be interpreted using a partial first
order logic. We exploit the capability of this logic to talk about the truth
status of formulae to define a notion of coherence between utterances and
explain how this coherence relation can serve for the construction of AND/OR
trees that represent the segmentation of the dialog. In a BDI model we
formalize basic assumptions about dialog and cooperative behaviour of
participants. These assumptions provide a basis for inferring speech acts from
coherence relations between utterances and attitudes of dialog participants.
Speech acts prove to be useful for determining dialog segments defined on the
notion of completing expectations of dialog participants. Finally, we sketch
how explicit segmentation signalled by cue phrases and performatives is covered
by our dialog model.
