Exploring Conversational Language Generation for Rich Content about
  Hotels
Dialogue systems for hotel and tourist information have typically simplified
the richness of the domain, focusing system utterances on only a few selected
attributes such as price, location and type of rooms. However, much more
content is typically available for hotels, often as many as 50 distinct
instantiated attributes for an individual entity. New methods are needed to use
this content to generate natural dialogues for hotel information, and in
general for any domain with such rich complex content. We describe three
experiments aimed at collecting data that can inform an NLG for hotels
dialogues, and show, not surprisingly, that the sentences in the original
written hotel descriptions provided on webpages for each hotel are
stylistically not a very good match for conversational interaction. We quantify
the stylistic features that characterize the differences between the original
textual data and the collected dialogic data. We plan to use these in stylistic
models for generation, and for scoring retrieved utterances for use in hotel
dialogues
