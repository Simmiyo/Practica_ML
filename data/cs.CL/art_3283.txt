Personal Names in Modern Turkey
We analyzed the most common 5000 male and 5000 female Turkish names based on
their etymological, morphological, and semantic attributes. The name statistics
are based on all Turkish citizens who were alive in 2014 and they cover 90% of
all population. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the most
comprehensive data-driven analysis of Turkish personal names. Female names have
a greater diversity than male names (e.g., top 15 male names cover 25% of the
male population, whereas top 28 female names cover 25% of the female
population). Despite their diversity, female names exhibit predictable
patterns. For example, certain roots such as g\"ul and nar (rose and
pomegranate/red, respectively) are used to generate hundreds of unique female
names. Turkish personal names have their origins mainly in Arabic, followed by
Turkish and Persian. We computed overall frequencies of names according to
broad semantic themes that were identified in previous studies. We found that
foreign-origin names such as olga and khaled, pastoral names such as ya\u{g}mur
and deniz (rain and sea, respectively), and names based on fruits and plants
such as filiz and menek\c{s}e (sprout and violet, respectively) are more
frequently observed among females. Among males, names based on animals such as
arslan and yunus (lion and dolphin, respectively) and names based on famous
and/or historical figures such as mustafa kemal and o\u{g}uz ka\u{g}an (founder
of the Turkish Republic and the founder of the Turks in Turkish mythology,
respectively) are observed more frequently.
