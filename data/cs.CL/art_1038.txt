TransA: An Adaptive Approach for Knowledge Graph Embedding
Knowledge representation is a major topic in AI, and many studies attempt to
represent entities and relations of knowledge base in a continuous vector
space. Among these attempts, translation-based methods build entity and
relation vectors by minimizing the translation loss from a head entity to a
tail one. In spite of the success of these methods, translation-based methods
also suffer from the oversimplified loss metric, and are not competitive enough
to model various and complex entities/relations in knowledge bases. To address
this issue, we propose \textbf{TransA}, an adaptive metric approach for
embedding, utilizing the metric learning ideas to provide a more flexible
embedding method. Experiments are conducted on the benchmark datasets and our
proposed method makes significant and consistent improvements over the
state-of-the-art baselines.
