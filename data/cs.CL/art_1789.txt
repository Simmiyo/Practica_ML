Distance Metric Learning for Aspect Phrase Grouping
Aspect phrase grouping is an important task in aspect-level sentiment
analysis. It is a challenging problem due to polysemy and context dependency.
We propose an Attention-based Deep Distance Metric Learning (ADDML) method, by
considering aspect phrase representation as well as context representation.
First, leveraging the characteristics of the review text, we automatically
generate aspect phrase sample pairs for distant supervision. Second, we feed
word embeddings of aspect phrases and their contexts into an attention-based
neural network to learn feature representation of contexts. Both aspect phrase
embedding and context embedding are used to learn a deep feature subspace for
measure the distances between aspect phrases for K-means clustering.
Experiments on four review datasets show that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art strong baseline methods.
