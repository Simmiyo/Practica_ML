Semantic Matching Against a Corpus: New Applications and Methods
We consider the case of a domain expert who wishes to explore the extent to
which a particular idea is expressed in a text collection. We propose the task
of semantically matching the idea, expressed as a natural language proposition,
against a corpus. We create two preliminary tasks derived from existing
datasets, and then introduce a more realistic one on disaster recovery designed
for emergency managers, whom we engaged in a user study. On the latter, we find
that a new model built from natural language entailment data produces
higher-quality matches than simple word-vector averaging, both on
expert-crafted queries and on ones produced by the subjects themselves. This
work provides a proof-of-concept for such applications of semantic matching and
illustrates key challenges.
