A Systematic Review of Automated Grammar Checking in English Language
Grammar checking is the task of detection and correction of grammatical
errors in the text. English is the dominating language in the field of science
and technology. Therefore, the non-native English speakers must be able to use
correct English grammar while reading, writing or speaking. This generates the
need of automatic grammar checking tools. So far many approaches have been
proposed and implemented. But less efforts have been made in surveying the
literature in the past decade. The objective of this systematic review is to
examine the existing literature, highlighting the current issues and suggesting
the potential directions of future research. This systematic review is a result
of analysis of 12 primary studies obtained after designing a search strategy
for selecting papers found on the web. We also present a possible scheme for
the classification of grammar errors. Among the main observations, we found
that there is a lack of efficient and robust grammar checking tools for real
time applications. We present several useful illustrations- most prominent are
the schematic diagrams that we provide for each approach and a table that
summarizes these approaches along different dimensions such as target error
types, linguistic dataset used, strengths and limitations of the approach. This
facilitates better understandability, comparison and evaluation of previous
research.
