Recurrent DNNs and its Ensembles on the TIMIT Phone Recognition Task
In this paper, we have investigated recurrent deep neural networks (DNNs) in
combination with regularization techniques as dropout, zoneout, and
regularization post-layer. As a benchmark, we chose the TIMIT phone recognition
task due to its popularity and broad availability in the community. It also
simulates a low-resource scenario that is helpful in minor languages. Also, we
prefer the phone recognition task because it is much more sensitive to an
acoustic model quality than a large vocabulary continuous speech recognition
task. In recent years, recurrent DNNs pushed the error rates in automatic
speech recognition down. But, there was no clear winner in proposed
architectures. The dropout was used as the regularization technique in most
cases, but combination with other regularization techniques together with model
ensembles was omitted. However, just an ensemble of recurrent DNNs performed
best and achieved an average phone error rate from 10 experiments 14.84 %
(minimum 14.69 %) on core test set that is slightly lower then the
best-published PER to date, according to our knowledge. Finally, in contrast of
the most papers, we published the open-source scripts to easily replicate the
results and to help continue the development.
