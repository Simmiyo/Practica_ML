Joint Named Entity Recognition and Stance Detection in Tweets
Named entity recognition (NER) is a well-established task of information
extraction which has been studied for decades. More recently, studies reporting
NER experiments on social media texts have emerged. On the other hand, stance
detection is a considerably new research topic usually considered within the
scope of sentiment analysis. Stance detection studies are mostly applied to
texts of online debates where the stance of the text owner for a particular
target, either explicitly or implicitly mentioned in text, is explored. In this
study, we investigate the possible contribution of named entities to the stance
detection task in tweets. We report the evaluation results of NER experiments
as well as that of the subsequent stance detection experiments using named
entities, on a publicly-available stance-annotated data set of tweets. Our
results indicate that named entities obtained with a high-performance NER
system can contribute to stance detection performance on tweets.
