An Expert System for Automatic Reading of A Text Written in Standard
  Arabic
In this work we present our expert system of Automatic reading or speech
synthesis based on a text written in Standard Arabic, our work is carried out
in two great stages: the creation of the sound data base, and the
transformation of the written text into speech (Text To Speech TTS). This
transformation is done firstly by a Phonetic Orthographical Transcription (POT)
of any written Standard Arabic text with the aim of transforming it into his
corresponding phonetics sequence, and secondly by the generation of the voice
signal which corresponds to the chain transcribed. We spread out the different
of conception of the system, as well as the results obtained compared to others
works studied to realize TTS based on Standard Arabic.
