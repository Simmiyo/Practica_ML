Jointly Embedding Relations and Mentions for Knowledge Population
This paper contributes a joint embedding model for predicting relations
between a pair of entities in the scenario of relation inference. It differs
from most stand-alone approaches which separately operate on either knowledge
bases or free texts. The proposed model simultaneously learns low-dimensional
vector representations for both triplets in knowledge repositories and the
mentions of relations in free texts, so that we can leverage the evidence both
resources to make more accurate predictions. We use NELL to evaluate the
performance of our approach, compared with cutting-edge methods. Results of
extensive experiments show that our model achieves significant improvement on
relation extraction.
