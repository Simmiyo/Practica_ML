Learning when to trust distant supervision: An application to
  low-resource POS tagging using cross-lingual projection
Cross lingual projection of linguistic annotation suffers from many sources
of bias and noise, leading to unreliable annotations that cannot be used
directly. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to sequence tagging that
learns to correct the errors from cross-lingual projection using an explicit
debiasing layer. This is framed as joint learning over two corpora, one tagged
with gold standard and the other with projected tags. We evaluated with only
1,000 tokens tagged with gold standard tags, along with more plentiful parallel
data. Our system equals or exceeds the state-of-the-art on eight simulated
low-resource settings, as well as two real low-resource languages, Malagasy and
Kinyarwanda.
