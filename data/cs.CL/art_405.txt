Parsing of part-of-speech tagged Assamese Texts
A natural language (or ordinary language) is a language that is spoken,
written, or signed by humans for general-purpose communication, as
distinguished from formal languages (such as computer-programming languages or
the "languages" used in the study of formal logic). The computational
activities required for enabling a computer to carry out information processing
using natural language is called natural language processing. We have taken
Assamese language to check the grammars of the input sentence. Our aim is to
produce a technique to check the grammatical structures of the sentences in
Assamese text. We have made grammar rules by analyzing the structures of
Assamese sentences. Our parsing program finds the grammatical errors, if any,
in the Assamese sentence. If there is no error, the program will generate the
parse tree for the Assamese sentence
