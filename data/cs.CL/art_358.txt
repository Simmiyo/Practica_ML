Open architecture for multilingual parallel texts
Multilingual parallel texts (abbreviated to parallel texts) are linguistic
versions of the same content ("translations"); e.g., the Maastricht Treaty in
English and Spanish are parallel texts. This document is about creating an open
architecture for the whole Authoring, Translation and Publishing Chain
(ATP-chain) for the processing of parallel texts.
