A Generative Model of a Pronunciation Lexicon for Hindi
Voice browser applications in Text-to- Speech (TTS) and Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) systems crucially depend on a pronunciation lexicon. The
present paper describes the model of pronunciation lexicon of Hindi developed
to automatically generate the output forms of Hindi at two levels, the
<phoneme> and the <PS> (PS, in short for Prosodic Structure). The latter level
involves both syllable-division and stress placement. The paper describes the
tool developed for generating the two-level outputs of lexica in Hindi.
