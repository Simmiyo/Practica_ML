Learning Neural Word Salience Scores
Measuring the salience of a word is an essential step in numerous NLP tasks.
Heuristic approaches such as tfidf have been used so far to estimate the
salience of words. We propose \emph{Neural Word Salience} (NWS) scores, unlike
heuristics, are learnt from a corpus. Specifically, we learn word salience
scores such that, using pre-trained word embeddings as the input, can
accurately predict the words that appear in a sentence, given the words that
appear in the sentences preceding or succeeding that sentence. Experimental
results on sentence similarity prediction show that the learnt word salience
scores perform comparably or better than some of the state-of-the-art
approaches for representing sentences on benchmark datasets for sentence
similarity, while using only a fraction of the training and prediction times
required by prior methods. Moreover, our NWS scores positively correlate with
psycholinguistic measures such as concreteness, and imageability implying a
close connection to the salience as perceived by humans.
