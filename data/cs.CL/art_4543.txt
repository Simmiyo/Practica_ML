Review Helpfulness Prediction with Embedding-Gated CNN
Product reviews, in the form of texts dominantly, significantly help
consumers finalize their purchasing decisions. Thus, it is important for
e-commerce companies to predict review helpfulness to present and recommend
reviews in a more informative manner. In this work, we introduce a
convolutional neural network model that is able to extract abstract features
from multi-granularity representations. Inspired by the fact that different
words contribute to the meaning of a sentence differently, we consider to learn
word-level embedding-gates for all the representations. Furthermore, as it is
common that some product domains/categories have rich user reviews, other
domains not. To help domains with less sufficient data, we integrate our model
into a cross-domain relationship learning framework for effectively
transferring knowledge from other domains. Extensive experiments show that our
model yields better performance than the existing methods.
