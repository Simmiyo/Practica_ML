ALL-IN-1: Short Text Classification with One Model for All Languages
We present ALL-IN-1, a simple model for multilingual text classification that
does not require any parallel data. It is based on a traditional Support Vector
Machine classifier exploiting multilingual word embeddings and character
n-grams. Our model is simple, easily extendable yet very effective, overall
ranking 1st (out of 12 teams) in the IJCNLP 2017 shared task on customer
feedback analysis in four languages: English, French, Japanese and Spanish.
