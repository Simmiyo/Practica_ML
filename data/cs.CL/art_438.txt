A PDTB-Styled End-to-End Discourse Parser
We have developed a full discourse parser in the Penn Discourse Treebank
(PDTB) style. Our trained parser first identifies all discourse and
non-discourse relations, locates and labels their arguments, and then
classifies their relation types. When appropriate, the attribution spans to
these relations are also determined. We present a comprehensive evaluation from
both component-wise and error-cascading perspectives.
