Acquisition of morphological families and derivational series from a
  machine readable dictionary
The paper presents a linguistic and computational model aiming at making the
morphological structure of the lexicon emerge from the formal and semantic
regularities of the words it contains. The model is word-based. The proposed
morphological structure consists of (1) binary relations that connect each
headword with words that are morphologically related, and especially with the
members of its morphological family and its derivational series, and of (2) the
analogies that hold between the words. The model has been tested on the lexicon
of French using the TLFi machine readable dictionary.
