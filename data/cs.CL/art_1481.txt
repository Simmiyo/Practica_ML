Memory-augmented Chinese-Uyghur Neural Machine Translation
Neural machine translation (NMT) has achieved notable performance recently.
However, this approach has not been widely applied to the translation task
between Chinese and Uyghur, partly due to the limited parallel data resource
and the large proportion of rare words caused by the agglutinative nature of
Uyghur. In this paper, we collect ~200,000 sentence pairs and show that with
this middle-scale database, an attention-based NMT can perform very well on
Chinese-Uyghur/Uyghur-Chinese translation. To tackle rare words, we propose a
novel memory structure to assist the NMT inference. Our experiments
demonstrated that the memory-augmented NMT (M-NMT) outperforms both the vanilla
NMT and the phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT). Interestingly,
the memory structure provides an elegant way for dealing with words that are
out of vocabulary.
