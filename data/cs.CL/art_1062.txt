Automata networks for multi-party communication in the Naming Game
The Naming Game has been studied to explore the role of self-organization in
the development and negotiation of linguistic conventions. In this paper, we
define an automata networks approach to the Naming Game. Two problems are
faced: (1) the definition of an automata networks for multi-party communicative
interactions; and (2) the proof of convergence for three different orders in
which the individuals are updated (updating schemes). Finally, computer
simulations are explored in two-dimensional lattices with the purpose to
recover the main features of the Naming Game and to describe the dynamics under
different updating schemes.
