The Logoscope: a Semi-Automatic Tool for Detecting and Documenting
  French New Words
In this article we present the design and implementation of the Logoscope,
the first tool especially developed to detect new words of the French language,
to document them and allow a public access through a web interface.
  This semi-automatic tool collects new words daily by browsing the online
versions of French well known newspapers such as Le Monde, Le Figaro, L'Equipe,
Lib\'eration, La Croix, Les \'Echos. In contrast to other existing tools
essentially dedicated to dictionary development, the Logoscope attempts to give
a more complete account of the context in which the new words occur. In
addition to the commonly given morpho-syntactic information it also provides
information about the textual and discursive contexts of the word creation; in
particular, it automatically determines the (journalistic) topics of the text
containing the new word.
  In this article we first give a general overview of the developed tool. We
then describe the approach taken, we discuss the linguistic background which
guided our design decisions and present the computational methods we used to
implement it.
