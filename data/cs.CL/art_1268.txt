Vietnamese Named Entity Recognition using Token Regular Expressions and
  Bidirectional Inference
This paper describes an efficient approach to improve the accuracy of a named
entity recognition system for Vietnamese. The approach combines regular
expressions over tokens and a bidirectional inference method in a sequence
labelling model. The proposed method achieves an overall $F_1$ score of 89.66%
on a test set of an evaluation campaign, organized in late 2016 by the
Vietnamese Language and Speech Processing (VLSP) community.
