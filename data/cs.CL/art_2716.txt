N-GrAM: New Groningen Author-profiling Model
We describe our participation in the PAN 2017 shared task on Author
Profiling, identifying authors' gender and language variety for English,
Spanish, Arabic and Portuguese. We describe both the final, submitted system,
and a series of negative results. Our aim was to create a single model for both
gender and language, and for all language varieties. Our best-performing system
(on cross-validated results) is a linear support vector machine (SVM) with word
unigrams and character 3- to 5-grams as features. A set of additional features,
including POS tags, additional datasets, geographic entities, and Twitter
handles, hurt, rather than improve, performance. Results from cross-validation
indicated high performance overall and results on the test set confirmed them,
at 0.86 averaged accuracy, with performance on sub-tasks ranging from 0.68 to
0.98.
