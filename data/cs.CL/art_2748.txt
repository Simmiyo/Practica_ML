A Short Survey of Biomedical Relation Extraction Techniques
Biomedical information is growing rapidly in the recent years and retrieving
useful data through information extraction system is getting more attention. In
the current research, we focus on different aspects of relation extraction
techniques in biomedical domain and briefly describe the state-of-the-art for
relation extraction between a variety of biological elements.
