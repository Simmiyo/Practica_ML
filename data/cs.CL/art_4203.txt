Towards Automation of Sense-type Identification of Verbs in
  OntoSenseNet(Telugu)
In this paper, we discuss the enrichment of a manually developed resource of
Telugu lexicon, OntoSenseNet. OntoSenseNet is a ontological sense annotated
lexicon that marks each verb of Telugu with a primary and a secondary sense.
The area of research is relatively recent but has a large scope of development.
We provide an introductory work to enrich the OntoSenseNet to promote further
research in Telugu. Classifiers are adopted to learn the sense relevant
features of the words in the resource and also to automate the tagging of
sense-types for verbs. We perform a comparative analysis of different
classifiers applied on OntoSenseNet. The results of the experiment prove that
automated enrichment of the resource is effective using SVM classifiers and
Adaboost ensemble.
