Mobile Keyboard Input Decoding with Finite-State Transducers
We propose a finite-state transducer (FST) representation for the models used
to decode keyboard inputs on mobile devices. Drawing from learnings from the
field of speech recognition, we describe a decoding framework that can satisfy
the strict memory and latency constraints of keyboard input. We extend this
framework to support functionalities typically not present in speech
recognition, such as literal decoding, autocorrections, word completions, and
next word predictions.
  We describe the general framework of what we call for short the keyboard "FST
decoder" as well as the implementation details that are new compared to a
speech FST decoder. We demonstrate that the FST decoder enables new UX features
such as post-corrections. Finally, we sketch how this decoder can support
advanced features such as personalization and contextualization.
