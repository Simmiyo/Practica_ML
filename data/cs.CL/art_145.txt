Semantic interpretation of temporal information by abductive inference
Besides temporal information explicitly available in verbs and adjuncts, the
temporal interpretation of a text also depends on general world knowledge and
default assumptions. We will present a theory for describing the relation
between, on the one hand, verbs, their tenses and adjuncts and, on the other,
the eventualities and periods of time they represent and their relative
temporal locations.
  The theory is formulated in logic and is a practical implementation of the
concepts described in Ness Schelkens et al. We will show how an abductive
resolution procedure can be used on this representation to extract temporal
information from texts.
