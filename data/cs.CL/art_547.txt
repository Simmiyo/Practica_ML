Developing a model for a text database indexed pedagogically for
  teaching the Arabic language
In this memory we made the design of an indexing model for Arabic language
and adapting standards for describing learning resources used (the LOM and
their application profiles) with learning conditions such as levels education
of students, their levels of understanding...the pedagogical context with
taking into account the repre-sentative elements of the text, text's
length,...in particular, we highlight the specificity of the Arabic language
which is a complex language, characterized by its flexion, its voyellation and
its agglutination.
