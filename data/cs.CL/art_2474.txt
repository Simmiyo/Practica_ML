Character-Word LSTM Language Models
We present a Character-Word Long Short-Term Memory Language Model which both
reduces the perplexity with respect to a baseline word-level language model and
reduces the number of parameters of the model. Character information can reveal
structural (dis)similarities between words and can even be used when a word is
out-of-vocabulary, thus improving the modeling of infrequent and unknown words.
By concatenating word and character embeddings, we achieve up to 2.77% relative
improvement on English compared to a baseline model with a similar amount of
parameters and 4.57% on Dutch. Moreover, we also outperform baseline word-level
models with a larger number of parameters.
