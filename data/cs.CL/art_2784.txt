Rule-Based Spanish Morphological Analyzer Built From Spell Checking
  Lexicon
Preprocessing tools for automated text analysis have become more widely
available in major languages, but non-English tools are often still limited in
their functionality. When working with Spanish-language text, researchers can
easily find tools for tokenization and stemming, but may not have the means to
extract more complex word features like verb tense or mood. Yet Spanish is a
morphologically rich language in which such features are often identifiable
from word form. Conjugation rules are consistent, but many special verbs and
nouns take on different rules. While building a complete dictionary of known
words and their morphological rules would be labor intensive, resources to do
so already exist, in spell checkers designed to generate valid forms of known
words. This paper introduces a set of tools for Spanish-language morphological
analysis, built using the COES spell checking tools, to label person, mood,
tense, gender and number, derive a word's root noun or verb infinitive, and
convert verbs to their nominal form.
