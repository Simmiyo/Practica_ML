The E2E Dataset: New Challenges For End-to-End Generation
This paper describes the E2E data, a new dataset for training end-to-end,
data-driven natural language generation systems in the restaurant domain, which
is ten times bigger than existing, frequently used datasets in this area. The
E2E dataset poses new challenges: (1) its human reference texts show more
lexical richness and syntactic variation, including discourse phenomena; (2)
generating from this set requires content selection. As such, learning from
this dataset promises more natural, varied and less template-like system
utterances. We also establish a baseline on this dataset, which illustrates
some of the difficulties associated with this data.
