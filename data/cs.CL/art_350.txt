Textual Entailment Recognizing by Theorem Proving Approach
In this paper we present two original methods for recognizing textual
inference. First one is a modified resolution method such that some linguistic
considerations are introduced in the unification of two atoms. The approach is
possible due to the recent methods of transforming texts in logic formulas.
Second one is based on semantic relations in text, as presented in WordNet.
Some similarities between these two methods are remarked.
