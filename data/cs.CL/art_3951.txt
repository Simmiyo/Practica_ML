Crowd-Labeling Fashion Reviews with Quality Control
We present a new methodology for high-quality labeling in the fashion domain
with crowd workers instead of experts. We focus on the Aspect-Based Sentiment
Analysis task. Our methods filter out inaccurate input from crowd workers but
we preserve different worker labeling to capture the inherent high variability
of the opinions. We demonstrate the quality of labeled data based on Facebook's
FastText framework as a baseline.
