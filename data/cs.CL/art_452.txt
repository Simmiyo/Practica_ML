Performance Evaluation of Statistical Approaches for Text Independent
  Speaker Recognition Using Source Feature
This paper introduces the performance evaluation of statistical approaches
for TextIndependent speaker recognition system using source feature. Linear
prediction LP residual is used as a representation of excitation information in
speech. The speaker-specific information in the excitation of voiced speech is
captured using statistical approaches such as Gaussian Mixture Models GMMs and
Hidden Markov Models HMMs. The decrease in the error during training and
recognizing speakers during testing phase close to 100 percent accuracy
demonstrates that the excitation component of speech contains speaker-specific
information and is indeed being effectively captured by continuous Ergodic HMM
than GMM. The performance of the speaker recognition system is evaluated on GMM
and 2 state ergodic HMM with different mixture components and test speech
duration. We demonstrate the speaker recognition studies on TIMIT database for
both GMM and Ergodic HMM.
