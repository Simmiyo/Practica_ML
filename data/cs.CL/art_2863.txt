Recent Trends in Deep Learning Based Natural Language Processing
Deep learning methods employ multiple processing layers to learn hierarchical
representations of data and have produced state-of-the-art results in many
domains. Recently, a variety of model designs and methods have blossomed in the
context of natural language processing (NLP). In this paper, we review
significant deep learning related models and methods that have been employed
for numerous NLP tasks and provide a walk-through of their evolution. We also
summarize, compare and contrast the various models and put forward a detailed
understanding of the past, present and future of deep learning in NLP.
