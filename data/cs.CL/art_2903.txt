The Natural Stories Corpus
It is now a common practice to compare models of human language processing by
predicting participant reactions (such as reading times) to corpora consisting
of rich naturalistic linguistic materials. However, many of the corpora used in
these studies are based on naturalistic text and thus do not contain many of
the low-frequency syntactic constructions that are often required to
distinguish processing theories. Here we describe a new corpus consisting of
English texts edited to contain many low-frequency syntactic constructions
while still sounding fluent to native speakers. The corpus is annotated with
hand-corrected parse trees and includes self-paced reading time data. Here we
give an overview of the content of the corpus and release the data.
