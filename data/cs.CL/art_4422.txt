ISNA-Set: A novel English Corpus of Iran NEWS
News agencies publish news on their websites all over the world. Moreover,
creating novel corpuses is necessary to bring natural processing to new
domains. Textual processing of online news is challenging in terms of the
strategy of collecting data, the complex structure of news websites, and
selecting or designing suitable algorithms for processing these types of data.
Despite the previous works which focus on creating corpuses for Iran news in
Persian, in this paper, we introduce a new corpus for English news of a
national news agency. ISNA-Set is a new dataset of English news of Iranian
Students News Agency (ISNA), as one of the most famous news agencies in Iran.
We statistically analyze the data and the sentiments of news, and also extract
entities and part-of-speech tagging.
