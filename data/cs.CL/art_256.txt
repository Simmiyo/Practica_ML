The Linguistic DS: Linguisitic Description in MPEG-7
MPEG-7 (Moving Picture Experts Group Phase 7) is an XML-based international
standard on semantic description of multimedia content. This document discusses
the Linguistic DS and related tools. The linguistic DS is a tool, based on the
GDA tag set (http://i-content.org/GDA/tagset.html), for semantic annotation of
linguistic data in or associated with multimedia content. The current document
text reflects `Study of FPDAM - MPEG-7 MDS Extensions' issued in March 2003,
and not most part of MPEG-7 MDS, for which the readers are referred to the
first version of MPEG-7 MDS document available from ISO (http://www.iso.org).
Without that reference, however, this document should be mostly intelligible to
those who are familiar with XML and linguistic theories. Comments are welcome
and will be considered in the standardization process.
