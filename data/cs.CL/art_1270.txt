Chinese Restaurant Process for cognate clustering: A threshold free
  approach
In this paper, we introduce a threshold free approach, motivated from Chinese
Restaurant Process, for the purpose of cognate clustering. We show that our
approach yields similar results to a linguistically motivated cognate
clustering system known as LexStat. Our Chinese Restaurant Process system is
fast and does not require any threshold and can be applied to any language
family of the world.
