Roget's Thesaurus: a Lexical Resource to Treasure
This paper presents the steps involved in creating an electronic lexical
knowledge base from the 1987 Penguin edition of Roget's Thesaurus. Semantic
relations are labelled with the help of WordNet. The two resources are compared
in a qualitative and quantitative manner. Differences in the organization of
the lexical material are discussed, as well as the possibility of merging both
resources.
