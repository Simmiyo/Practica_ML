Label-Dependencies Aware Recurrent Neural Networks
In the last few years, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have proved effective
on several NLP tasks. Despite such great success, their ability to model
\emph{sequence labeling} is still limited. This lead research toward solutions
where RNNs are combined with models which already proved effective in this
domain, such as CRFs. In this work we propose a solution far simpler but very
effective: an evolution of the simple Jordan RNN, where labels are re-injected
as input into the network, and converted into embeddings, in the same way as
words. We compare this RNN variant to all the other RNN models, Elman and
Jordan RNN, LSTM and GRU, on two well-known tasks of Spoken Language
Understanding (SLU). Thanks to label embeddings and their combination at the
hidden layer, the proposed variant, which uses more parameters than Elman and
Jordan RNNs, but far fewer than LSTM and GRU, is more effective than other
RNNs, but also outperforms sophisticated CRF models.
