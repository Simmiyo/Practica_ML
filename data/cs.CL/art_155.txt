Meaning Sort - Three examples: dictionary construction, tagged corpus
  construction, and information presentation system
It is often useful to sort words into an order that reflects relations among
their meanings as obtained by using a thesaurus. In this paper, we introduce a
method of arranging words semantically by using several types of `{\sf is-a}'
thesauri and a multi-dimensional thesaurus. We also describe three major
applications where a meaning sort is useful and show the effectiveness of a
meaning sort. Since there is no doubt that a word list in meaning-order is
easier to use than a word list in some random order, a meaning sort, which can
easily produce a word list in meaning-order, must be useful and effective.
