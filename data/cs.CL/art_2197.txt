Grammar rules for the isiZulu complex verb
The isiZulu verb is known for its morphological complexity, which is a
subject for on-going linguistics research, as well as for prospects of
computational use, such as controlled natural language interfaces, machine
translation, and spellcheckers. To this end, we seek to answer the question as
to what the precise grammar rules for the isiZulu complex verb are (and, by
extension, the Bantu verb morphology). To this end, we iteratively specify the
grammar as a Context Free Grammar, and evaluate it computationally. The grammar
presented in this paper covers the subject and object concords, negation,
present tense, aspect, mood, and the causative, applicative, stative, and the
reciprocal verbal extensions, politeness, the wh-question modifiers, and aspect
doubling, ensuring their correct order as they appear in verbs. The grammar
conforms to specification.
