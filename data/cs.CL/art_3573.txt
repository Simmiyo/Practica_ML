Sentiment Analysis of Code-Mixed Languages leveraging Resource Rich
  Languages
Code-mixed data is an important challenge of natural language processing
because its characteristics completely vary from the traditional structures of
standard languages.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Sentiment Analysis of
Code-Mixed Text (SACMT) to classify sentences into their corresponding
sentiment - positive, negative or neutral, using contrastive learning. We
utilize the shared parameters of siamese networks to map the sentences of
code-mixed and standard languages to a common sentiment space. Also, we
introduce a basic clustering based preprocessing method to capture variations
of code-mixed transliterated words. Our experiments reveal that SACMT
outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in sentiment analysis for
code-mixed text by 7.6% in accuracy and 10.1% in F-score.
