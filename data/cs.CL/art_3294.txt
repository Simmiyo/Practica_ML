Using reinforcement learning to learn how to play text-based games
The ability to learn optimal control policies in systems where action space
is defined by sentences in natural language would allow many interesting
real-world applications such as automatic optimisation of dialogue systems.
Text-based games with multiple endings and rewards are a promising platform for
this task, since their feedback allows us to employ reinforcement learning
techniques to jointly learn text representations and control policies. We
present a general text game playing agent, testing its generalisation and
transfer learning performance and showing its ability to play multiple games at
once. We also present pyfiction, an open-source library for universal access to
different text games that could, together with our agent that implements its
interface, serve as a baseline for future research.
