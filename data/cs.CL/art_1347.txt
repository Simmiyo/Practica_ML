Tracing metaphors in time through self-distance in vector spaces
From a diachronic corpus of Italian, we build consecutive vector spaces in
time and use them to compare a term's cosine similarity to itself in different
time spans. We assume that a drop in similarity might be related to the
emergence of a metaphorical sense at a given time. Similarity-based
observations are matched to the actual year when a figurative meaning was
documented in a reference dictionary and through manual inspection of corpus
occurrences.
