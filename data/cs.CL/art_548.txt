BADREX: In situ expansion and coreference of biomedical abbreviations
  using dynamic regular expressions
BADREX uses dynamically generated regular expressions to annotate term
definition-term abbreviation pairs, and corefers unpaired acronyms and
abbreviations back to their initial definition in the text. Against the
Medstract corpus BADREX achieves precision and recall of 98% and 97%, and
against a much larger corpus, 90% and 85%, respectively. BADREX yields improved
performance over previous approaches, requires no training data and allows
runtime customisation of its input parameters. BADREX is freely available from
https://github.com/philgooch/BADREX-Biomedical-Abbreviation-Expander as a
