Population size predicts lexical diversity, but so does the mean sea
  level - why it is important to correctly account for the structure of
  temporal data
In order to demonstrate why it is important to correctly account for the
(serial dependent) structure of temporal data, we document an apparently
spectacular relationship between population size and lexical diversity: for
five out of seven investigated languages, there is a strong relationship
between population size and lexical diversity of the primary language in this
country. We show that this relationship is the result of a misspecified model
that does not consider the temporal aspect of the data by presenting a similar
but nonsensical relationship between the global annual mean sea level and
lexical diversity. Given the fact that in the recent past, several studies were
published that present surprising links between different economic, cultural,
political and (socio-)demographical variables on the one hand and cultural or
linguistic characteristics on the other hand, but seem to suffer from exactly
this problem, we explain the cause of the misspecification and show that it has
profound consequences. We demonstrate how simple transformation of the time
series can often solve problems of this type and argue that the evaluation of
the plausibility of a relationship is important in this context. We hope that
our paper will help both researchers and reviewers to understand why it is
important to use special models for the analysis of data with a natural
temporal ordering.
