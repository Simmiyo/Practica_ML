The Character Thinks Ahead: creative writing with deep learning nets and
  its stylistic assessment
We discuss how to control outputs from deep learning models of text corpora
so as to create contemporary poetic works. We assess whether these controls are
successful in the immediate sense of creating stylo- metric distinctiveness.
The specific context is our piece The Character Thinks Ahead (2016/17); the
potential applications are broad.
