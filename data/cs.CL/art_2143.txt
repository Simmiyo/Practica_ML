Referential Uncertainty and Word Learning in High-dimensional,
  Continuous Meaning Spaces
This paper discusses lexicon word learning in high-dimensional meaning spaces
from the viewpoint of referential uncertainty. We investigate various
state-of-the-art Machine Learning algorithms and discuss the impact of scaling,
representation and meaning space structure. We demonstrate that current Machine
Learning techniques successfully deal with high-dimensional meaning spaces. In
particular, we show that exponentially increasing dimensions linearly impact
learner performance and that referential uncertainty from word sensitivity has
no impact.
