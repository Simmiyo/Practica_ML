Learning Document Embeddings by Predicting N-grams for Sentiment
  Classification of Long Movie Reviews
Despite the loss of semantic information, bag-of-ngram based methods still
achieve state-of-the-art results for tasks such as sentiment classification of
long movie reviews. Many document embeddings methods have been proposed to
capture semantics, but they still can't outperform bag-of-ngram based methods
on this task. In this paper, we modify the architecture of the recently
proposed Paragraph Vector, allowing it to learn document vectors by predicting
not only words, but n-gram features as well. Our model is able to capture both
semantics and word order in documents while keeping the expressive power of
learned vectors. Experimental results on IMDB movie review dataset shows that
our model outperforms previous deep learning models and bag-of-ngram based
models due to the above advantages. More robust results are also obtained when
our model is combined with other models. The source code of our model will be
also published together with this paper.
