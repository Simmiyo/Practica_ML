Computerization of African languages-French dictionaries
This paper relates work done during the DiLAF project. It consists in
converting 5 bilingual African language-French dictionaries originally in Word
format into XML following the LMF model. The languages processed are Bambara,
Hausa, Kanuri, Tamajaq and Songhai-zarma, still considered as under-resourced
languages concerning Natural Language Processing tools. Once converted, the
dictionaries are available online on the Jibiki platform for lookup and
modification. The DiLAF project is first presented. A description of each
dictionary follows. Then, the conversion methodology from .doc format to XML
files is presented. A specific point on the usage of Unicode follows. Then,
each step of the conversion into XML and LMF is detailed. The last part
presents the Jibiki lexical resources management platform used for the project.
