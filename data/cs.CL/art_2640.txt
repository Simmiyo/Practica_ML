Information Density as a Factor for Variation in the Embedding of
  Relative Clauses
In German, relative clauses can be positioned in-situ or extraposed. A
potential factor for the variation might be information density. In this study,
this hypothesis is tested with a corpus of 17th century German funeral sermons.
For each referent in the relative clauses and their matrix clauses, the
attention state was determined (first calculation). In a second calculation,
for each word the surprisal values were determined, using a bi-gram language
model. In a third calculation, the surprisal values were accommodated as to
whether it is the first occurrence of the word in question or not. All three
calculations pointed in the same direction: With in-situ relative clauses, the
rate of new referents was lower and the average surprisal values were lower,
especially the accommodated surprisal values, than with extraposed relative
clauses. This indicated that in-formation density is a factor governing the
choice between in-situ and extraposed relative clauses. The study also sheds
light on the intrinsic relation-ship between the information theoretic concept
of information density and in-formation structural concepts such as givenness
which are used under a more linguistic perspective.
