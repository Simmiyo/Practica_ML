Fast calculation of entropy with Zhang's estimator
Entropy is a fundamental property of a repertoire. Here, we present an
efficient algorithm to estimate the entropy of types with the help of Zhang's
estimator. The algorithm takes advantage of the fact that the number of
different frequencies in a text is in general much smaller than the number of
types. We justify the convenience of the algorithm by means of an analysis of
the statistical properties of texts from more than 1000 languages. Our work
opens up various possibilities for future research.
