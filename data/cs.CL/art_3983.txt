Core Conflictual Relationship: Text Mining to Discover What and When
Following detailed presentation of the Core Conflictual Relationship Theme
(CCRT), there is the objective of relevant methods for what has been described
as verbalization and visualization of data. Such is also termed data mining and
text mining, and knowledge discovery in data. The Correspondence Analysis
methodology, also termed Geometric Data Analysis, is shown in a case study to
be comprehensive and revealing. Computational efficiency depends on how the
analysis process is structured. For both illustrative and revealing aspects of
the case study here, relatively extensive dream reports are used. This
Geometric Data Analysis confirms the validity of CCRT method.
