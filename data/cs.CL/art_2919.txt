Seernet at EmoInt-2017: Tweet Emotion Intensity Estimator
The paper describes experiments on estimating emotion intensity in tweets
using a generalized regressor system. The system combines lexical, syntactic
and pre-trained word embedding features, trains them on general regressors and
finally combines the best performing models to create an ensemble. The proposed
system stood 3rd out of 22 systems in the leaderboard of WASSA-2017 Shared Task
on Emotion Intensity.
