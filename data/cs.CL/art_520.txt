A Corpus-based Study of Temporal Signals
Automatic temporal ordering of events described in discourse has been of
great interest in recent years. Event orderings are conveyed in text via va
rious linguistic mechanisms including the use of expressions such as "before",
"after" or "during" that explicitly assert a temporal relation -- temporal
signals. In this paper, we investigate the role of temporal signals in temporal
relation extraction and provide a quantitative analysis of these expres sions
in the TimeBank annotated corpus.
