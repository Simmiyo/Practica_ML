Clinical TempEval
We describe the Clinical TempEval task which is currently in preparation for
the SemEval-2015 evaluation exercise. This task involves identifying and
describing events, times and the relations between them in clinical text. Six
discrete subtasks are included, focusing on recognising mentions of times and
events, describing those mentions for both entity types, identifying the
relation between an event and the document creation time, and identifying
narrative container relations.
