Unsupervised domain-agnostic identification of product names in social
  media posts
Product name recognition is a significant practical problem, spurred by the
greater availability of platforms for discussing products such as social media
and product review functionalities of online marketplaces. Customers, product
manufacturers and online marketplaces may want to identify product names in
unstructured text to extract important insights, such as sentiment, surrounding
a product. Much extant research on product name identification has been
domain-specific (e.g., identifying mobile phone models) and used supervised or
semi-supervised methods. With massive numbers of new products released to the
market every year such methods may require retraining on updated labeled data
to stay relevant, and may transfer poorly across domains. This research
addresses this challenge and develops a domain-agnostic, unsupervised algorithm
for identifying product names based on Facebook posts. The algorithm consists
of two general steps: (a) candidate product name identification using an
off-the-shelf pretrained conditional random fields (CRF) model, part-of-speech
tagging and a set of simple patterns; and (b) filtering of candidate names to
remove spurious entries using clustering and word embeddings generated from the
data.
