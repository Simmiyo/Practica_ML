Modeling Language Change in Historical Corpora: The Case of Portuguese
This paper presents a number of experiments to model changes in a historical
Portuguese corpus composed of literary texts for the purpose of temporal text
classification. Algorithms were trained to classify texts with respect to their
publication date taking into account lexical variation represented as word
n-grams, and morphosyntactic variation represented by part-of-speech (POS)
distribution. We report results of 99.8% accuracy using word unigram features
with a Support Vector Machines classifier to predict the publication date of
documents in time intervals of both one century and half a century. A feature
analysis is performed to investigate the most informative features for this
task and how they are linked to language change.
