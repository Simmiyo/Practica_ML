A chain dictionary method for Word Sense Disambiguation and applications
A large class of unsupervised algorithms for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)
is that of dictionary-based methods. Various algorithms have as the root Lesk's
algorithm, which exploits the sense definitions in the dictionary directly. Our
approach uses the lexical base WordNet for a new algorithm originated in
Lesk's, namely "chain algorithm for disambiguation of all words", CHAD. We show
how translation from a language into another one and also text entailment
verification could be accomplished by this disambiguation.
