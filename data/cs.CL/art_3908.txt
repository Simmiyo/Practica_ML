SNU_IDS at SemEval-2018 Task 12: Sentence Encoder with Contextualized
  Vectors for Argument Reasoning Comprehension
We present a novel neural architecture for the Argument Reasoning
Comprehension task of SemEval 2018. It is a simple neural network consisting of
three parts, collectively judging whether the logic built on a set of given
sentences (a claim, reason, and warrant) is plausible or not. The model
utilizes contextualized word vectors pre-trained on large machine translation
(MT) datasets as a form of transfer learning, which can help to mitigate the
lack of training data. Quantitative analysis shows that simply leveraging LSTMs
trained on MT datasets outperforms several baselines and non-transferred
models, achieving accuracies of about 70% on the development set and about 60%
on the test set.
