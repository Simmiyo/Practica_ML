Building a robust sentiment lexicon with (almost) no resource
Creating sentiment polarity lexicons is labor intensive. Automatically
translating them from resourceful languages requires in-domain machine
translation systems, which rely on large quantities of bi-texts. In this paper,
we propose to replace machine translation by transferring words from the
lexicon through word embeddings aligned across languages with a simple linear
transform. The approach leads to no degradation, compared to machine
translation, when tested on sentiment polarity classification on tweets from
four languages.
