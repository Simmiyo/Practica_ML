AP18-OLR Challenge: Three Tasks and Their Baselines
The third oriental language recognition (OLR) challenge AP18-OLR is
introduced in this paper, including the data profile, the tasks and the
evaluation principles. Following the events in the last two years, namely
AP16-OLR and AP17-OLR, the challenge this year focuses on more challenging
tasks, including (1) short-duration utterances, (2) confusing languages, and
(3) open-set recognition. The same as the previous events, the data of AP18-OLR
is also provided by SpeechOcean and the NSFC M2ASR project. Baselines based on
both the i-vector model and neural networks are constructed for the
participants' reference. We report the baseline results on the three tasks and
demonstrate that the three tasks are truly challenging. All the data is free
for participants, and the Kaldi recipes for the baselines have been published
online.
