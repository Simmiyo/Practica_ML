Evaluation of Croatian Word Embeddings
Croatian is poorly resourced and highly inflected language from Slavic
language family. Nowadays, research is focusing mostly on English. We created a
new word analogy corpus based on the original English Word2vec word analogy
corpus and added some of the specific linguistic aspects from Croatian
language. Next, we created Croatian WordSim353 and RG65 corpora for a basic
evaluation of word similarities. We compared created corpora on two popular
word representation models, based on Word2Vec tool and fastText tool. Models
has been trained on 1.37B tokens training data corpus and tested on a new
robust Croatian word analogy corpus. Results show that models are able to
create meaningful word representation. This research has shown that free word
order and the higher morphological complexity of Croatian language influences
the quality of resulting word embeddings.
