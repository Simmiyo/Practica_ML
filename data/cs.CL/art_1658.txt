INAUT, a Controlled Language for the French Coast Pilot Books
  Instructions nautiques
We describe INAUT, a controlled natural language dedicated to collaborative
update of a knowledge base on maritime navigation and to automatic generation
of coast pilot books (Instructions nautiques) of the French National
Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service SHOM. INAUT is based on French language
and abundantly uses georeferenced entities. After describing the structure of
the overall system, giving details on the language and on its generation, and
discussing the three major applications of INAUT (document production,
interaction with ENCs and collaborative updates of the knowledge base), we
conclude with future extensions and open problems.
