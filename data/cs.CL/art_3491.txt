Challenges in Discriminating Profanity from Hate Speech
In this study we approach the problem of distinguishing general profanity
from hate speech in social media, something which has not been widely
considered. Using a new dataset annotated specifically for this task, we employ
supervised classification along with a set of features that includes n-grams,
skip-grams and clustering-based word representations. We apply approaches based
on single classifiers as well as more advanced ensemble classifiers and stacked
generalization, achieving the best result of 80% accuracy for this 3-class
classification task. Analysis of the results reveals that discriminating hate
speech and profanity is not a simple task, which may require features that
capture a deeper understanding of the text not always possible with surface
n-grams. The variability of gold labels in the annotated data, due to
differences in the subjective adjudications of the annotators, is also an
issue. Other directions for future work are discussed.
