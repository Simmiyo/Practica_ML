The Basque task: did systems perform in the upperbound?
In this paper we describe the Senseval 2 Basque lexical-sample task. The task
comprised 40 words (15 nouns, 15 verbs and 10 adjectives) selected from Euskal
Hiztegia, the main Basque dictionary. Most examples were taken from the
Egunkaria newspaper. The method used to hand-tag the examples produced low
inter-tagger agreement (75%) before arbitration. The four competing systems
attained results well above the most frequent baseline and the best system
scored 75% precision at 100% coverage. The paper includes an analysis of the
tagging procedure used, as well as the performance of the competing systems. In
particular, we argue that inter-tagger agreement is not a real upperbound for
the Basque WSD task.
