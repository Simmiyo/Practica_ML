Fence - An Efficient Parser with Ambiguity Support for Model-Driven
  Language Specification
Model-based language specification has applications in the implementation of
language processors, the design of domain-specific languages, model-driven
software development, data integration, text mining, natural language
processing, and corpus-based induction of models. Model-based language
specification decouples language design from language processing and, unlike
traditional grammar-driven approaches, which constrain language designers to
specific kinds of grammars, it needs general parser generators able to deal
with ambiguities. In this paper, we propose Fence, an efficient bottom-up
parsing algorithm with lexical and syntactic ambiguity support that enables the
use of model-based language specification in practice.
