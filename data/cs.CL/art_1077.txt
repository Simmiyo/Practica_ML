Statistical Parsing by Machine Learning from a Classical Arabic Treebank
Research into statistical parsing for English has enjoyed over a decade of
successful results. However, adapting these models to other languages has met
with difficulties. Previous comparative work has shown that Modern Arabic is
one of the most difficult languages to parse due to rich morphology and free
word order. Classical Arabic is the ancient form of Arabic, and is understudied
in computational linguistics, relative to its worldwide reach as the language
of the Quran. The thesis is based on seven publications that make significant
contributions to knowledge relating to annotating and parsing Classical Arabic.
  A central argument of this thesis is that using a hybrid representation
closely aligned to traditional grammar leads to improved parsing for Arabic. To
test this hypothesis, two approaches are compared. As a reference, a pure
dependency parser is adapted using graph transformations, resulting in an
87.47% F1-score. This is compared to an integrated parsing model with an
F1-score of 89.03%, demonstrating that joint dependency-constituency parsing is
better suited to Classical Arabic.
