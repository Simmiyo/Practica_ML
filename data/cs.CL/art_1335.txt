Building a comprehensive syntactic and semantic corpus of Chinese
  clinical texts
Objective: To build a comprehensive corpus covering syntactic and semantic
annotations of Chinese clinical texts with corresponding annotation guidelines
and methods as well as to develop tools trained on the annotated corpus, which
supplies baselines for research on Chinese texts in the clinical domain.
  Materials and methods: An iterative annotation method was proposed to train
annotators and to develop annotation guidelines. Then, by using annotation
quality assurance measures, a comprehensive corpus was built, containing
annotations of part-of-speech (POS) tags, syntactic tags, entities, assertions,
and relations. Inter-annotator agreement (IAA) was calculated to evaluate the
annotation quality and a Chinese clinical text processing and information
extraction system (CCTPIES) was developed based on our annotated corpus.
  Results: The syntactic corpus consists of 138 Chinese clinical documents with
47,424 tokens and 2553 full parsing trees, while the semantic corpus includes
992 documents that annotated 39,511 entities with their assertions and 7695
relations. IAA evaluation shows that this comprehensive corpus is of good
quality, and the system modules are effective.
  Discussion: The annotated corpus makes a considerable contribution to natural
language processing (NLP) research into Chinese texts in the clinical domain.
However, this corpus has a number of limitations. Some additional types of
clinical text should be introduced to improve corpus coverage and active
learning methods should be utilized to promote annotation efficiency.
  Conclusions: In this study, several annotation guidelines and an annotation
method for Chinese clinical texts were proposed, and a comprehensive corpus
with its NLP modules were constructed, providing a foundation for further study
of applying NLP techniques to Chinese texts in the clinical domain.
