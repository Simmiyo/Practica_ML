Character-level Convolutional Network for Text Classification Applied to
  Chinese Corpus
This article provides an interesting exploration of character-level
convolutional neural network solving Chinese corpus text classification
problem. We constructed a large-scale Chinese language dataset, and the result
shows that character-level convolutional neural network works better on Chinese
corpus than its corresponding pinyin format dataset. This is the first time
that character-level convolutional neural network applied to text
classification problem.
