Hate Speech Dataset from a White Supremacy Forum
Hate speech is commonly defined as any communication that disparages a target
group of people based on some characteristic such as race, colour, ethnicity,
gender, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, or other characteristic. Due
to the massive rise of user-generated web content on social media, the amount
of hate speech is also steadily increasing. Over the past years, interest in
online hate speech detection and, particularly, the automation of this task has
continuously grown, along with the societal impact of the phenomenon. This
paper describes a hate speech dataset composed of thousands of sentences
manually labelled as containing hate speech or not. The sentences have been
extracted from Stormfront, a white supremacist forum. A custom annotation tool
has been developed to carry out the manual labelling task which, among other
things, allows the annotators to choose whether to read the context of a
sentence before labelling it. The paper also provides a thoughtful qualitative
and quantitative study of the resulting dataset and several baseline
experiments with different classification models. The dataset is publicly
available.
