Testing SDRT's Right Frontier
The Right Frontier Constraint (RFC), as a constraint on the attachment of new
constituents to an existing discourse structure, has important implications for
the interpretation of anaphoric elements in discourse and for Machine Learning
(ML) approaches to learning discourse structures. In this paper we provide
strong empirical support for SDRT's version of RFC. The analysis of about 100
doubly annotated documents by five different naive annotators shows that SDRT's
RFC is respected about 95% of the time. The qualitative analysis of presumed
violations that we have performed shows that they are either click-errors or
structural misconceptions.
