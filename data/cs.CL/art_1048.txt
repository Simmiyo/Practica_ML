Polish - English Speech Statistical Machine Translation Systems for the
  IWSLT 2014
This research explores effects of various training settings between Polish
and English Statistical Machine Translation systems for spoken language.
Various elements of the TED parallel text corpora for the IWSLT 2014 evaluation
campaign were used as the basis for training of language models, and for
development, tuning and testing of the translation system as well as Wikipedia
based comparable corpora prepared by us. The BLEU, NIST, METEOR and TER metrics
were used to evaluate the effects of data preparations on translation results.
Our experiments included systems, which use lemma and morphological information
on Polish words. We also conducted a deep analysis of provided Polish data as
preparatory work for the automatic data correction and cleaning phase.
