Effects of Word Embeddings on Neural Network-based Pitch Accent
  Detection
Pitch accent detection often makes use of both acoustic and lexical features
based on the fact that pitch accents tend to correlate with certain words. In
this paper, we extend a pitch accent detector that involves a convolutional
neural network to include word embeddings, which are state-of-the-art vector
representations of words. We examine the effect these features have on
within-corpus and cross-corpus experiments on three English datasets. The
results show that while word embeddings can improve the performance in
corpus-dependent experiments, they also have the potential to make
generalization to unseen data more challenging.
