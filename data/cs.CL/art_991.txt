A complex network approach to stylometry
Statistical methods have been widely employed to study the fundamental
properties of language. In recent years, methods from complex and dynamical
systems proved useful to create several language models. Despite the large
amount of studies devoted to represent texts with physical models, only a
limited number of studies have shown how the properties of the underlying
physical systems can be employed to improve the performance of natural language
processing tasks. In this paper, I address this problem by devising complex
networks methods that are able to improve the performance of current
statistical methods. Using a fuzzy classification strategy, I show that the
topological properties extracted from texts complement the traditional textual
description. In several cases, the performance obtained with hybrid approaches
outperformed the results obtained when only traditional or networked methods
were used. Because the proposed model is generic, the framework devised here
could be straightforwardly used to study similar textual applications where the
topology plays a pivotal role in the description of the interacting agents.
