Lexical Base as a Compressed Language Model of the World (on the
  material of the Ukrainian language)
In the article the fact is verified that the list of words selected by formal
statistical methods (frequency and functional genre unrestrictedness) is not a
conglomerate of non-related words. It creates a system of interrelated items
and it can be named "lexical base of language". This selected list of words
covers all the spheres of human activities. To verify this statement the
invariant synoptical scheme common for ideographic dictionaries of different
language was determined.
