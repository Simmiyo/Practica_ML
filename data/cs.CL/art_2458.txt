Linear Ensembles of Word Embedding Models
This paper explores linear methods for combining several word embedding
models into an ensemble. We construct the combined models using an iterative
method based on either ordinary least squares regression or the solution to the
orthogonal Procrustes problem.
  We evaluate the proposed approaches on Estonian---a morphologically complex
language, for which the available corpora for training word embeddings are
relatively small. We compare both combined models with each other and with the
input word embedding models using synonym and analogy tests. The results show
that while using the ordinary least squares regression performs poorly in our
experiments, using orthogonal Procrustes to combine several word embedding
models into an ensemble model leads to 7-10% relative improvements over the
mean result of the initial models in synonym tests and 19-47% in analogy tests.
