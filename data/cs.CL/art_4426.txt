A Characterwise Windowed Approach to Hebrew Morphological Segmentation
This paper presents a novel approach to the segmentation of orthographic word
forms in contemporary Hebrew, focusing purely on splitting without carrying out
morphological analysis or disambiguation. Casting the analysis task as
character-wise binary classification and using adjacent character and
word-based lexicon-lookup features, this approach achieves over 98% accuracy on
the benchmark SPMRL shared task data for Hebrew, and 97% accuracy on a new out
of domain Wikipedia dataset, an improvement of ~4% and 5% over previous state
of the art performance.
