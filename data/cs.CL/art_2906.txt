On the Contribution of Discourse Structure on Text Complexity Assessment
This paper investigates the influence of discourse features on text
complexity assessment. To do so, we created two data sets based on the Penn
Discourse Treebank and the Simple English Wikipedia corpora and compared the
influence of coherence, cohesion, surface, lexical and syntactic features to
assess text complexity.
  Results show that with both data sets coherence features are more correlated
to text complexity than the other types of features. In addition, feature
selection revealed that with both data sets the top most discriminating feature
is a coherence feature.
