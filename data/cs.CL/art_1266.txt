Addressing Community Question Answering in English and Arabic
This paper studies the impact of different types of features applied to
learning to re-rank questions in community Question Answering. We tested our
models on two datasets released in SemEval-2016 Task 3 on "Community Question
Answering". Task 3 targeted real-life Web fora both in English and Arabic. Our
models include bag-of-words features (BoW), syntactic tree kernels (TKs), rank
features, embeddings, and machine translation evaluation features. To the best
of our knowledge, structural kernels have barely been applied to the question
reranking task, where they have to model paraphrase relations. In the case of
the English question re-ranking task, we compare our learning to rank (L2R)
algorithms against a strong baseline given by the Google-generated ranking
(GR). The results show that i) the shallow structures used in our TKs are
robust enough to noisy data and ii) improving GR is possible, but effective BoW
features and TKs along with an accurate model of GR features in the used L2R
algorithm are required. In the case of the Arabic question re-ranking task, for
the first time we applied tree kernels on syntactic trees of Arabic sentences.
Our approaches to both tasks obtained the second best results on SemEval-2016
subtasks B on English and D on Arabic.
