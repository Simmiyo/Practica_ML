Comparing morphological complexity of Spanish, Otomi and Nahuatl
We use two small parallel corpora for comparing the morphological complexity
of Spanish, Otomi and Nahuatl. These are languages that belong to different
linguistic families, the latter are low-resourced. We take into account two
quantitative criteria, on one hand the distribution of types over tokens in a
corpus, on the other, perplexity and entropy as indicators of word structure
predictability. We show that a language can be complex in terms of how many
different morphological word forms can produce, however, it may be less complex
in terms of predictability of its internal structure of words.
