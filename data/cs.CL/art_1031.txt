A Parallel Corpus of Translationese
We describe a set of bilingual English--French and English--German parallel
corpora in which the direction of translation is accurately and reliably
annotated. The corpora are diverse, consisting of parliamentary proceedings,
literary works, transcriptions of TED talks and political commentary. They will
be instrumental for research of translationese and its applications to (human
and machine) translation; specifically, they can be used for the task of
translationese identification, a research direction that enjoys a growing
interest in recent years. To validate the quality and reliability of the
corpora, we replicated previous results of supervised and unsupervised
identification of translationese, and further extended the experiments to
additional datasets and languages.
