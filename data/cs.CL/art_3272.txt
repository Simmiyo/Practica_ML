Building a Sentiment Corpus of Tweets in Brazilian Portuguese
The large amount of data available in social media, forums and websites
motivates researches in several areas of Natural Language Processing, such as
sentiment analysis. The popularity of the area due to its subjective and
semantic characteristics motivates research on novel methods and approaches for
classification. Hence, there is a high demand for datasets on different domains
and different languages. This paper introduces TweetSentBR, a sentiment corpora
for Brazilian Portuguese manually annotated with 15.000 sentences on TV show
domain. The sentences were labeled in three classes (positive, neutral and
negative) by seven annotators, following literature guidelines for ensuring
reliability on the annotation. We also ran baseline experiments on polarity
classification using three machine learning methods, reaching 80.99% on
F-Measure and 82.06% on accuracy in binary classification, and 59.85% F-Measure
and 64.62% on accuracy on three point classification.
