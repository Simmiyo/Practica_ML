Unsupervised Pseudo-Labeling for Extractive Summarization on Electronic
  Health Records
Extractive summarization is very useful for physicians to better manage and
digest Electronic Health Records (EHRs). However, the training of a supervised
model requires disease-specific medical background and is thus very expensive.
We studied how to utilize the intrinsic correlation between multiple EHRs to
generate pseudo-labels and train a supervised model with no external
annotation. Experiments on real-patient data validate that our model is
effective in summarizing crucial disease-specific information for patients.
