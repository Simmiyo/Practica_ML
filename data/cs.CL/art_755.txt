Evaluation and Ranking of Machine Translated Output in Hindi Language
  using Precision and Recall Oriented Metrics
Evaluation plays a crucial role in development of Machine translation
systems. In order to judge the quality of an existing MT system i.e. if the
translated output is of human translation quality or not, various automatic
metrics exist. We here present the implementation results of different metrics
when used on Hindi language along with their comparisons, illustrating how
effective are these metrics on languages like Hindi (free word order language).
