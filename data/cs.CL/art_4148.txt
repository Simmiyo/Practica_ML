Semantic Relation Classification: Task Formalisation and Refinement
The identification of semantic relations between terms within texts is a
fundamental task in Natural Language Processing which can support applications
requiring a lightweight semantic interpretation model. Currently, semantic
relation classification concentrates on relations which are evaluated over
open-domain data. This work provides a critique on the set of abstract
relations used for semantic relation classification with regard to their
ability to express relationships between terms which are found in a
domain-specific corpora. Based on this analysis, this work proposes an
alternative semantic relation model based on reusing and extending the set of
abstract relations present in the DOLCE ontology. The resulting set of
relations is well grounded, allows to capture a wide range of relations and
could thus be used as a foundation for automatic classification of semantic
relations.
