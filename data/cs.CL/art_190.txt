Testing for Mathematical Lineation in Jim Crace's "Quarantine" and T. S.
  Eliot's "Four Quartets"
The mathematical distinction between prose and verse may be detected in
writings that are not apparently lineated, for example in T. S. Eliot's "Burnt
Norton", and Jim Crace's "Quarantine". In this paper we offer comments on
appropriate statistical methods for such work, and also on the nature of formal
innovation in these two texts. Additional remarks are made on the roots of
lineation as a metrical form, and on the prose-verse continuum.
