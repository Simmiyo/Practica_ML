Cooperation between Pronoun and Reference Resolution for Unrestricted
  Texts
Anaphora resolution is envisaged in this paper as part of the reference
resolution process. A general open architecture is proposed, which can be
particularized and configured in order to simulate some classic anaphora
resolution methods. With the aim of improving pronoun resolution, the system
takes advantage of elementary cues about characters of the text, which are
represented through a particular data structure. In its most robust
configuration, the system uses only a general lexicon, a local morpho-syntactic
parser and a dictionary of synonyms. A short comparative corpus analysis shows
that narrative texts are the most suitable for testing such a system.
