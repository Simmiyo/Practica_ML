TFW, DamnGina, Juvie, and Hotsie-Totsie: On the Linguistic and Social
  Aspects of Internet Slang
Slang is ubiquitous on the Internet. The emergence of new social contexts
like micro-blogs, question-answering forums, and social networks has enabled
slang and non-standard expressions to abound on the web. Despite this, slang
has been traditionally viewed as a form of non-standard language -- a form of
language that is not the focus of linguistic analysis and has largely been
neglected. In this work, we use UrbanDictionary to conduct the first
large-scale linguistic analysis of slang and its social aspects on the Internet
to yield insights into this variety of language that is increasingly used all
over the world online.
  We begin by computationally analyzing the phonological, morphological and
syntactic properties of slang. We then study linguistic patterns in four
specific categories of slang namely alphabetisms, blends, clippings, and
reduplicatives. Our analysis reveals that slang demonstrates extra-grammatical
rules of phonological and morphological formation that markedly distinguish it
from the standard form shedding insight into its generative patterns. Next, we
analyze the social aspects of slang by studying subject restriction and
stereotyping in slang usage. Analyzing tens of thousands of such slang words
reveals that the majority of slang on the Internet belongs to two major
categories: sex and drugs. We also noted that not only is slang usage not
immune to prevalent social biases and prejudices but also reflects such biases
and stereotypes more intensely than the standard variety.
