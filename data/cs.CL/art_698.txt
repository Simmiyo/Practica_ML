Natural Language Processing in Biomedicine: A Unified System
  Architecture Overview
In modern electronic medical records (EMR) much of the clinically important
data - signs and symptoms, symptom severity, disease status, etc. - are not
provided in structured data fields, but rather are encoded in clinician
generated narrative text. Natural language processing (NLP) provides a means of
"unlocking" this important data source for applications in clinical decision
support, quality assurance, and public health. This chapter provides an
overview of representative NLP systems in biomedicine based on a unified
architectural view. A general architecture in an NLP system consists of two
main components: background knowledge that includes biomedical knowledge
resources and a framework that integrates NLP tools to process text. Systems
differ in both components, which we will review briefly. Additionally,
challenges facing current research efforts in biomedical NLP include the
paucity of large, publicly available annotated corpora, although initiatives
that facilitate data sharing, system evaluation, and collaborative work between
researchers in clinical NLP are starting to emerge.
