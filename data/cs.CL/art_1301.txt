Sequence-to-sequence neural network models for transliteration
Transliteration is a key component of machine translation systems and
software internationalization. This paper demonstrates that neural
sequence-to-sequence models obtain state of the art or close to state of the
art results on existing datasets. In an effort to make machine transliteration
accessible, we open source a new Arabic to English transliteration dataset and
our trained models.
