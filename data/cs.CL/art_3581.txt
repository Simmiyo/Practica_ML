Word Segmentation as Graph Partition
We propose a new approach to the Chinese word segmentation problem that
considers the sentence as an undirected graph, whose nodes are the characters.
One can use various techniques to compute the edge weights that measure the
connection strength between characters. Spectral graph partition algorithms are
used to group the characters and achieve word segmentation. We follow the graph
partition approach and design several unsupervised algorithms, and we show
their inspiring segmentation results on two corpora: (1) electronic health
records in Chinese, and (2) benchmark data from the Second International
Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff.
