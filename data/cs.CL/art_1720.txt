The Effects of Age, Gender and Region on Non-standard Linguistic
  Variation in Online Social Networks
We present a corpus-based analysis of the effects of age, gender and region
of origin on the production of both "netspeak" or "chatspeak" features and
regional speech features in Flemish Dutch posts that were collected from a
Belgian online social network platform. The present study shows that combining
quantitative and qualitative approaches is essential for understanding
non-standard linguistic variation in a CMC corpus. It also presents a
methodology that enables the systematic study of this variation by including
all non-standard words in the corpus. The analyses resulted in a convincing
illustration of the Adolescent Peak Principle. In addition, our approach
revealed an intriguing correlation between the use of regional speech features
and chatspeak features.
