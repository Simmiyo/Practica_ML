Sentence Correction Based on Large-scale Language Modelling
With the further development of informatization, more and more data is stored
in the form of text. There are some loss of text during their generation and
transmission. The paper aims to establish a language model based on the
large-scale corpus to complete the restoration of missing text. In this paper,
we introduce a novel measurement to find the missing words, and a way of
establishing a comprehensive candidate lexicon to insert the correct choice of
words. The paper also introduces some effective optimization methods, which
largely improve the efficiency of the text restoration and shorten the time of
dealing with 1000 sentences into 3.6 seconds. \keywords{ language model,
