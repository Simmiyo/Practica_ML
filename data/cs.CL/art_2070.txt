A Dictionary-based Approach to Racism Detection in Dutch Social Media
We present a dictionary-based approach to racism detection in Dutch social
media comments, which were retrieved from two public Belgian social media sites
likely to attract racist reactions. These comments were labeled as racist or
non-racist by multiple annotators. For our approach, three discourse
dictionaries were created: first, we created a dictionary by retrieving
possibly racist and more neutral terms from the training data, and then
augmenting these with more general words to remove some bias. A second
dictionary was created through automatic expansion using a \texttt{word2vec}
model trained on a large corpus of general Dutch text. Finally, a third
dictionary was created by manually filtering out incorrect expansions. We
trained multiple Support Vector Machines, using the distribution of words over
the different categories in the dictionaries as features. The best-performing
model used the manually cleaned dictionary and obtained an F-score of 0.46 for
the racist class on a test set consisting of unseen Dutch comments, retrieved
from the same sites used for the training set. The automated expansion of the
dictionary only slightly boosted the model's performance, and this increase in
performance was not statistically significant. The fact that the coverage of
the expanded dictionaries did increase indicates that the words that were
automatically added did occur in the corpus, but were not able to meaningfully
impact performance. The dictionaries, code, and the procedure for requesting
the corpus are available at: https://github.com/clips/hades
