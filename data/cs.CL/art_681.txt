Identifying Purpose Behind Electoral Tweets
Tweets pertaining to a single event, such as a national election, can number
in the hundreds of millions. Automatically analyzing them is beneficial in many
downstream natural language applications such as question answering and
summarization. In this paper, we propose a new task: identifying the purpose
behind electoral tweets--why do people post election-oriented tweets? We show
that identifying purpose is correlated with the related phenomenon of sentiment
and emotion detection, but yet significantly different. Detecting purpose has a
number of applications including detecting the mood of the electorate,
estimating the popularity of policies, identifying key issues of contention,
and predicting the course of events. We create a large dataset of electoral
tweets and annotate a few thousand tweets for purpose. We develop a system that
automatically classifies electoral tweets as per their purpose, obtaining an
accuracy of 43.56% on an 11-class task and an accuracy of 73.91% on a 3-class
task (both accuracies well above the most-frequent-class baseline). Finally, we
show that resources developed for emotion detection are also helpful for
detecting purpose.
