Bayesian Models for Unit Discovery on a Very Low Resource Language
Developing speech technologies for low-resource languages has become a very
active research field over the last decade. Among others, Bayesian models have
shown some promising results on artificial examples but still lack of in situ
experiments. Our work applies state-of-the-art Bayesian models to unsupervised
Acoustic Unit Discovery (AUD) in a real low-resource language scenario. We also
show that Bayesian models can naturally integrate information from other
resourceful languages by means of informative prior leading to more consistent
discovered units. Finally, discovered acoustic units are used, either as the
1-best sequence or as a lattice, to perform word segmentation. Word
segmentation results show that this Bayesian approach clearly outperforms a
Segmental-DTW baseline on the same corpus.
