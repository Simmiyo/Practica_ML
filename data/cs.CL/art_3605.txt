Automatic Language Identification System for Hindi and Magahi
Language identification has become a prerequisite for all kinds of automated
text processing systems. In this paper, we present a rule-based language
identifier tool for two closely related Indo-Aryan languages: Hindi and Magahi.
This system has currently achieved an accuracy of approx 86.34%. We hope to
improve this in the future. Automatic identification of languages will be
significant in the accuracy of output of Web Crawlers.
