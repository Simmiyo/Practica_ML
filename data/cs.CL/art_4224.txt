Towards Enhancing Lexical Resource and Using Sense-annotations of
  OntoSenseNet for Sentiment Analysis
This paper illustrates the interface of the tool we developed for crowd
sourcing and we explain the annotation procedure in detail. Our tool is named
as 'Parupalli Padajaalam' which means web of words by Parupalli. The aim of
this tool is to populate the OntoSenseNet, sentiment polarity annotated Telugu
resource. Recent works have shown the importance of word-level annotations on
sentiment analysis. With this as basis, we aim to analyze the importance of
sense-annotations obtained from OntoSenseNet in performing the task of
sentiment analysis. We explain the fea- tures extracted from OntoSenseNet
(Telugu). Furthermore we compute and explain the adverbial class distribution
of verbs in OntoSenseNet. This task is known to aid in disambiguating
word-senses which helps in enhancing the performance of word-sense
disambiguation (WSD) task(s).
