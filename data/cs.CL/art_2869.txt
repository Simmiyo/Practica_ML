Radical-level Ideograph Encoder for RNN-based Sentiment Analysis of
  Chinese and Japanese
The character vocabulary can be very large in non-alphabetic languages such
as Chinese and Japanese, which makes neural network models huge to process such
languages. We explored a model for sentiment classification that takes the
embeddings of the radicals of the Chinese characters, i.e, hanzi of Chinese and
kanji of Japanese. Our model is composed of a CNN word feature encoder and a
bi-directional RNN document feature encoder. The results achieved are on par
with the character embedding-based models, and close to the state-of-the-art
word embedding-based models, with 90% smaller vocabulary, and at least 13% and
80% fewer parameters than the character embedding-based models and word
embedding-based models respectively. The results suggest that the radical
embedding-based approach is cost-effective for machine learning on Chinese and
Japanese.
