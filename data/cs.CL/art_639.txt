Linear models and linear mixed effects models in R with linguistic
  applications
This text is a conceptual introduction to mixed effects modeling with
linguistic applications, using the R programming environment. The reader is
introduced to linear modeling and assumptions, as well as to mixed
effects/multilevel modeling, including a discussion of random intercepts,
random slopes and likelihood ratio tests. The example used throughout the text
focuses on the phonetic analysis of voice pitch data.
