Automated Fact Checking: Task formulations, methods and future
  directions
The recently increased focus on misinformation has stimulated research in
fact checking, the task of assessing the truthfulness of a claim. Research in
automating this task has been conducted in a variety of disciplines including
natural language processing, machine learning, knowledge representation,
databases, and journalism. While there has been substantial progress, relevant
papers and articles have been published in research communities that are often
unaware of each other and use inconsistent terminology, thus impeding
understanding and further progress. In this paper we survey automated fact
checking research stemming from natural language processing and related
disciplines, unifying the task formulations and methodologies across papers and
authors. Furthermore, we highlight the use of evidence as an important
distinguishing factor among them cutting across task formulations and methods.
We conclude with proposing avenues for future NLP research on automated fact
checking.
