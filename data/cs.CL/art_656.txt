A Hybrid Algorithm for Matching Arabic Names
In this paper, a new hybrid algorithm which combines both of token-based and
character-based approaches is presented. The basic Levenshtein approach has
been extended to token-based distance metric. The distance metric is enhanced
to set the proper granularity level behavior of the algorithm. It smoothly maps
a threshold of misspellings differences at the character level, and the
importance of token level errors in terms of token's position and frequency.
Using a large Arabic dataset, the experimental results show that the proposed
algorithm overcomes successfully many types of errors such as: typographical
errors, omission or insertion of middle name components, omission of
non-significant popular name components, and different writing styles character
variations. When compared the results with other classical algorithms, using
the same dataset, the proposed algorithm was found to increase the minimum
success level of best tested algorithms, while achieving higher upper limits .
