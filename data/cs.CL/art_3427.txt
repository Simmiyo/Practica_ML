Evaluating Scoped Meaning Representations
Semantic parsing offers many opportunities to improve natural language
understanding. We present a semantically annotated parallel corpus for English,
German, Italian, and Dutch where sentences are aligned with scoped meaning
representations in order to capture the semantics of negation, modals,
quantification, and presupposition triggers. The semantic formalism is based on
Discourse Representation Theory, but concepts are represented by WordNet
synsets and thematic roles by VerbNet relations. Translating scoped meaning
representations to sets of clauses enables us to compare them for the purpose
of semantic parser evaluation and checking translations. This is done by
computing precision and recall on matching clauses, in a similar way as is done
for Abstract Meaning Representations. We show that our matching tool for
evaluating scoped meaning representations is both accurate and efficient.
Applying this matching tool to three baseline semantic parsers yields F-scores
between 43% and 54%. A pilot study is performed to automatically find changes
in meaning by comparing meaning representations of translations. This
comparison turns out to be an additional way of (i) finding annotation mistakes
and (ii) finding instances where our semantic analysis needs to be improved.
