Pattern Based Term Extraction Using ACABIT System
In this paper, we propose a pattern-based term extraction approach for
Japanese, applying ACABIT system originally developed for French. The proposed
approach evaluates termhood using morphological patterns of basic terms and
term variants. After extracting term candidates, ACABIT system filters out
non-terms from the candidates based on log-likelihood. This approach is
suitable for Japanese term extraction because most of Japanese terms are
compound nouns or simple phrasal patterns.
