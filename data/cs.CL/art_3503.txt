Deep learning for affective computing: text-based emotion recognition in
  decision support
Emotions widely affect human decision-making. This fact is taken into account
by affective computing with the goal of tailoring decision support to the
emotional states of individuals. However, the accurate recognition of emotions
within narrative documents presents a challenging undertaking due to the
complexity and ambiguity of language. Performance improvements can be achieved
through deep learning; yet, as demonstrated in this paper, the specific nature
of this task requires the customization of recurrent neural networks with
regard to bidirectional processing, dropout layers as a means of
regularization, and weighted loss functions. In addition, we propose
sent2affect, a tailored form of transfer learning for affective computing: here
the network is pre-trained for a different task (i.e. sentiment analysis),
while the output layer is subsequently tuned to the task of emotion
recognition. The resulting performance is evaluated in a holistic setting
across 6 benchmark datasets, where we find that both recurrent neural networks
and transfer learning consistently outperform traditional machine learning.
Altogether, the findings have considerable implications for the use of
affective computing.
