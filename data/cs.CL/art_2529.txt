Medical Text Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks
We present an approach to automatically classify clinical text at a sentence
level. We are using deep convolutional neural networks to represent complex
features. We train the network on a dataset providing a broad categorization of
health information. Through a detailed evaluation, we demonstrate that our
method outperforms several approaches widely used in natural language
processing tasks by about 15%.
