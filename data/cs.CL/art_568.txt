Design of English-Hindi Translation Memory for Efficient Translation
Developing parallel corpora is an important and a difficult activity for
Machine Translation. This requires manual annotation by Human Translators.
Translating same text again is a useless activity. There are tools available to
implement this for European Languages, but no such tool is available for Indian
Languages. In this paper we present a tool for Indian Languages which not only
provides automatic translations of the previously available translation but
also provides multiple translations, in cases where a sentence has multiple
translations, in ranked list of suggestive translations for a sentence.
Moreover this tool also lets translators have global and local saving options
of their work, so that they may share it with others, which further lightens
the task.
