Construction of Vietnamese SentiWordNet by using Vietnamese Dictionary
SentiWordNet is an important lexical resource supporting sentiment analysis
in opinion mining applications. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to
construct a Vietnamese SentiWordNet (VSWN). SentiWordNet is typically generated
from WordNet in which each synset has numerical scores to indicate its opinion
polarities. Many previous studies obtained these scores by applying a machine
learning method to WordNet. However, Vietnamese WordNet is not available
unfortunately by the time of this paper. Therefore, we propose a method to
construct VSWN from a Vietnamese dictionary, not from WordNet. We show the
effectiveness of the proposed method by generating a VSWN with 39,561 synsets
automatically. The method is experimentally tested with 266 synsets with aspect
of positivity and negativity. It attains a competitive result compared with
English SentiWordNet that is 0.066 and 0.052 differences for positivity and
negativity sets respectively.
