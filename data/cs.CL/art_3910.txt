Style Obfuscation by Invariance
The task of obfuscating writing style using sequence models has previously
been investigated under the framework of obfuscation-by-transfer, where the
input text is explicitly rewritten in another style. These approaches also
often lead to major alterations to the semantic content of the input. In this
work, we propose obfuscation-by-invariance, and investigate to what extent
models trained to be explicitly style-invariant preserve semantics. We evaluate
our architectures on parallel and non-parallel corpora, and compare automatic
and human evaluations on the obfuscated sentences. Our experiments show that
style classifier performance can be reduced to chance level, whilst the
automatic evaluation of the output is seemingly equal to models applying
style-transfer. However, based on human evaluation we demonstrate a trade-off
between the level of obfuscation and the observed quality of the output in
terms of meaning preservation and grammaticality.
