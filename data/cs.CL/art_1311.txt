Recurrent Neural Network Language Model Adaptation Derived Document
  Vector
In many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, a document is commonly
modeled as a bag of words using the term frequency-inverse document frequency
(TF-IDF) vector. One major shortcoming of the frequency-based TF-IDF feature
vector is that it ignores word orders that carry syntactic and semantic
relationships among the words in a document, and they can be important in some
NLP tasks such as genre classification. This paper proposes a novel distributed
vector representation of a document: a simple recurrent-neural-network language
model (RNN-LM) or a long short-term memory RNN language model (LSTM-LM) is
first created from all documents in a task; some of the LM parameters are then
adapted by each document, and the adapted parameters are vectorized to
represent the document. The new document vectors are labeled as DV-RNN and
DV-LSTM respectively. We believe that our new document vectors can capture some
high-level sequential information in the documents, which other current
document representations fail to capture. The new document vectors were
evaluated in the genre classification of documents in three corpora: the Brown
Corpus, the BNC Baby Corpus and an artificially created Penn Treebank dataset.
Their classification performances are compared with the performance of TF-IDF
vector and the state-of-the-art distributed memory model of paragraph vector
(PV-DM). The results show that DV-LSTM significantly outperforms TF-IDF and
PV-DM in most cases, and combinations of the proposed document vectors with
TF-IDF or PV-DM may further improve performance.
