Generating Appealing Brand Names
Providing appealing brand names to newly launched products, newly formed
companies or for renaming existing companies is highly important as it can play
a crucial role in deciding its success or failure. In this work, we propose a
computational method to generate appealing brand names based on the description
of such entities. We use quantitative scores for readability, pronounceability,
memorability and uniqueness of the generated names to rank order them. A set of
diverse appealing names is recommended to the user for the brand naming task.
Experimental results show that the names generated by our approach are more
appealing than names which prior approaches and recruited humans could come up.
