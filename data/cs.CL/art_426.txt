Offline Arabic Handwriting Recognition Using Artificial Neural Network
The ambition of a character recognition system is to transform a text
document typed on paper into a digital format that can be manipulated by word
processor software Unlike other languages, Arabic has unique features, while
other language doesn't have, from this language these are seven or eight
language such as ordo, jewie and Persian writing, Arabic has twenty eight
letters, each of which can be linked in three different ways or separated
depending on the case. The difficulty of the Arabic handwriting recognition is
that, the accuracy of the character recognition which affects on the accuracy
of the word recognition, in additional there is also two or three from for each
character, the suggested solution by using artificial neural network can solve
the problem and overcome the difficulty of Arabic handwriting recognition.
