OntoSenseNet: A Verb-Centric Ontological Resource for Indian Languages
Following approaches for understanding lexical meaning developed by Yaska,
Patanjali and Bhartrihari from Indian linguistic traditions and extending
approaches developed by Leibniz and Brentano in the modern times, a framework
of formal ontology of language was developed. This framework proposes that
meaning of words are in-formed by intrinsic and extrinsic ontological
structures. The paper aims to capture such intrinsic and extrinsic meanings of
words for two major Indian languages, namely, Hindi and Telugu. Parts-of-speech
have been rendered into sense-types and sense-classes. Using them we have
developed a gold- standard annotated lexical resource to support semantic
understanding of a language. The resource has collection of Hindi and Telugu
lexicons, which has been manually annotated by native speakers of the languages
following our annotation guidelines. Further, the resource was utilised to
derive adverbial sense-class distribution of verbs and karaka-verb sense- type
distribution. Different corpora (news, novels) were compared using verb
sense-types distribution. Word Embedding was used as an aid for the enrichment
of the resource. This is a work in progress that aims at lexical coverage of
language extensively.
