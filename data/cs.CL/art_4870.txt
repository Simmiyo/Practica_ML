Multi-Source Neural Machine Translation with Data Augmentation
Multi-source translation systems translate from multiple languages to a
single target language. By using information from these multiple sources, these
systems achieve large gains in accuracy. To train these systems, it is
necessary to have corpora with parallel text in multiple sources and the target
language. However, these corpora are rarely complete in practice due to the
difficulty of providing human translations in all of the relevant languages. In
this paper, we propose a data augmentation approach to fill such incomplete
parts using multi-source neural machine translation (NMT). In our experiments,
results varied over different language combinations but significant gains were
observed when using a source language similar to the target language.
