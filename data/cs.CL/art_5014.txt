Neural Machine Translation into Language Varieties
Both research and commercial machine translation have so far neglected the
importance of properly handling the spelling, lexical and grammar divergences
occurring among language varieties. Notable cases are standard national
varieties such as Brazilian and European Portuguese, and Canadian and European
French, which popular online machine translation services are not keeping
distinct. We show that an evident side effect of modeling such varieties as
unique classes is the generation of inconsistent translations. In this work, we
investigate the problem of training neural machine translation from English to
specific pairs of language varieties, assuming both labeled and unlabeled
parallel texts, and low-resource conditions. We report experiments from English
to two pairs of dialects, EuropeanBrazilian Portuguese and European-Canadian
French, and two pairs of standardized varieties, Croatian-Serbian and
Indonesian-Malay. We show significant BLEU score improvements over baseline
systems when translation into similar languages is learned as a multilingual
task with shared representations.
