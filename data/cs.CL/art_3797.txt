Learning Patient Representations from Text
Mining electronic health records for patients who satisfy a set of predefined
criteria is known in medical informatics as phenotyping. Phenotyping has
numerous applications such as outcome prediction, clinical trial recruitment,
and retrospective studies. Supervised machine learning for phenotyping
typically relies on sparse patient representations such as bag-of-words. We
consider an alternative that involves learning patient representations. We
develop a neural network model for learning patient representations and show
that the learned representations are general enough to obtain state-of-the-art
performance on a standard comorbidity detection task.
