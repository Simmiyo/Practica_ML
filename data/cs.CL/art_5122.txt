Neural Collective Entity Linking
Entity Linking aims to link entity mentions in texts to knowledge bases, and
neural models have achieved recent success in this task. However, most existing
methods rely on local contexts to resolve entities independently, which may
usually fail due to the data sparsity of local information. To address this
issue, we propose a novel neural model for collective entity linking, named as
NCEL. NCEL applies Graph Convolutional Network to integrate both local
contextual features and global coherence information for entity linking. To
improve the computation efficiency, we approximately perform graph convolution
on a subgraph of adjacent entity mentions instead of those in the entire text.
We further introduce an attention scheme to improve the robustness of NCEL to
data noise and train the model on Wikipedia hyperlinks to avoid overfitting and
domain bias. In experiments, we evaluate NCEL on five publicly available
datasets to verify the linking performance as well as generalization ability.
We also conduct an extensive analysis of time complexity, the impact of key
modules, and qualitative results, which demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our proposed method.
