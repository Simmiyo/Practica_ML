Change of word types to word tokens ratio in the course of translation
  (based on Russian translations of K. Vonnegut novels)
The article provides lexical statistical analysis of K. Vonnegut's two novels
and their Russian translations. It is found out that there happen some changes
between the speed of word types and word tokens ratio change in the source and
target texts. The author hypothesizes that these changes are typical for
English-Russian translations, and moreover, they represent an example of
Baker's translation feature of levelling out.
