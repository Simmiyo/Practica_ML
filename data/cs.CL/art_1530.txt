Structure Regularized Bidirectional Recurrent Convolutional Neural
  Network for Relation Classification
Relation classification is an important semantic processing task in the field
of natural language processing (NLP). In this paper, we present a novel model,
Structure Regularized Bidirectional Recurrent Convolutional Neural
Network(SR-BRCNN), to classify the relation of two entities in a sentence, and
the new dataset of Chinese Sanwen for named entity recognition and relation
classification. Some state-of-the-art systems concentrate on modeling the
shortest dependency path (SDP) between two entities leveraging convolutional or
recurrent neural networks. We further explore how to make full use of the
dependency relations information in the SDP and how to improve the model by the
method of structure regularization. We propose a structure regularized model to
learn relation representations along the SDP extracted from the forest formed
by the structure regularized dependency tree, which benefits reducing the
complexity of the whole model and helps improve the $F_{1}$ score by 10.3.
Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art
approaches on the Chinese Sanwen task and performs as well on the SemEval-2010
Task 8 dataset\footnote{The Chinese Sanwen corpus this paper developed and used
will be released in the further.
