JESC: Japanese-English Subtitle Corpus
In this paper we describe the Japanese-English Subtitle Corpus (JESC). JESC
is a large Japanese-English parallel corpus covering the underrepresented
domain of conversational dialogue. It consists of more than 3.2 million
examples, making it the largest freely available dataset of its kind. The
corpus was assembled by crawling and aligning subtitles found on the web. The
assembly process incorporates a number of novel preprocessing elements to
ensure high monolingual fluency and accurate bilingual alignments. We summarize
its contents and evaluate its quality using human experts and baseline machine
translation (MT) systems.
