DefExt: A Semi Supervised Definition Extraction Tool
We present DefExt, an easy to use semi supervised Definition Extraction Tool.
DefExt is designed to extract from a target corpus those textual fragments
where a term is explicitly mentioned together with its core features, i.e. its
definition. It works on the back of a Conditional Random Fields based
sequential labeling algorithm and a bootstrapping approach. Bootstrapping
enables the model to gradually become more aware of the idiosyncrasies of the
target corpus. In this paper we describe the main components of the toolkit as
well as experimental results stemming from both automatic and manual
evaluation. We release DefExt as open source along with the necessary files to
run it in any Unix machine. We also provide access to training and test data
for immediate use.
