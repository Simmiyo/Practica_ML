Formalization of semantic network of image constructions in electronic
  content
A formal theory based on a binary operator of directional associative
relation is constructed in the article and an understanding of an associative
normal form of image constructions is introduced. A model of a commutative
semigroup, which provides a presentation of a sentence as three components of
an interrogative linguistic image construction, is considered.
