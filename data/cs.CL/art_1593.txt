Evaluating Machine Translation Performance on Chinese Idioms with a
  Blacklist Method
Idiom translation is a challenging problem in machine translation because the
meaning of idioms is non-compositional, and a literal (word-by-word)
translation is likely to be wrong. In this paper, we focus on evaluating the
quality of idiom translation of MT systems. We introduce a new evaluation
method based on an idiom-specific blacklist of literal translations, based on
the insight that the occurrence of any blacklisted words in the translation
output indicates a likely translation error. We introduce a dataset, CIBB
(Chinese Idioms Blacklists Bank), and perform an evaluation of a
state-of-the-art Chinese-English neural MT system. Our evaluation confirms that
a sizable number of idioms in our test set are mistranslated (46.1%), that
literal translation error is a common error type, and that our blacklist method
is effective at identifying literal translation errors.
