Towards an Arabic-English Machine-Translation Based on Semantic Web
Communication tools make the world like a small village and as a consequence
people can contact with others who are from different societies or who speak
different languages. This communication cannot happen effectively without
Machine Translation because they can be found anytime and everywhere. There are
a number of studies that have developed Machine Translation for the English
language with so many other languages except the Arabic it has not been
considered yet. Therefore we aim to highlight a roadmap for our proposed
translation machine to provide an enhanced Arabic English translation based on
Semantic.
