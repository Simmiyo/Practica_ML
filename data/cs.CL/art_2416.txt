Métodos de Otimização Combinatória Aplicados ao Problema de
  Compressão MultiFrases
The Internet has led to a dramatic increase in the amount of available
information. In this context, reading and understanding this flow of
information have become costly tasks. In the last years, to assist people to
understand textual data, various Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications
based on Combinatorial Optimization have been devised. However, for
Multi-Sentences Compression (MSC), method which reduces the sentence length
without removing core information, the insertion of optimization methods
requires further study to improve the performance of MSC. This article
describes a method for MSC using Combinatorial Optimization and Graph Theory to
generate more informative sentences while maintaining their grammaticality. An
experiment led on a corpus of 40 clusters of sentences shows that our system
has achieved a very good quality and is better than the state-of-the-art.
