A new TAG Formalism for Tamil and Parser Analytics
Tree adjoining grammar (TAG) is specifically suited for morph rich and
agglutinated languages like Tamil due to its psycho linguistic features and
parse time dependency and morph resolution. Though TAG and LTAG formalisms have
been known for about 3 decades, efforts on designing TAG Syntax for Tamil have
not been entirely successful due to the complexity of its specification and the
rich morphology of Tamil language. In this paper we present a minimalistic TAG
for Tamil without much morphological considerations and also introduce a parser
implementation with some obvious variations from the XTAG system
