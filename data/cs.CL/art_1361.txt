`Who would have thought of that!': A Hierarchical Topic Model for
  Extraction of Sarcasm-prevalent Topics and Sarcasm Detection
Topic Models have been reported to be beneficial for aspect-based sentiment
analysis. This paper reports a simple topic model for sarcasm detection, a
first, to the best of our knowledge. Designed on the basis of the intuition
that sarcastic tweets are likely to have a mixture of words of both sentiments
as against tweets with literal sentiment (either positive or negative), our
hierarchical topic model discovers sarcasm-prevalent topics and topic-level
sentiment. Using a dataset of tweets labeled using hashtags, the model
estimates topic-level, and sentiment-level distributions. Our evaluation shows
that topics such as `work', `gun laws', `weather' are sarcasm-prevalent topics.
Our model is also able to discover the mixture of sentiment-bearing words that
exist in a text of a given sentiment-related label. Finally, we apply our model
to predict sarcasm in tweets. We outperform two prior work based on statistical
classifiers with specific features, by around 25\%.
