Sex, drugs, and violence
Automatically detecting inappropriate content can be a difficult NLP task,
requiring understanding context and innuendo, not just identifying specific
keywords. Due to the large quantity of online user-generated content, automatic
detection is becoming increasingly necessary. We take a largely unsupervised
approach using a large corpus of narratives from a community-based
self-publishing website and a small segment of crowd-sourced annotations. We
explore topic modelling using latent Dirichlet allocation (and a variation),
and use these to regress appropriateness ratings, effectively automating rating
for suitability. The results suggest that certain topics inferred may be useful
in detecting latent inappropriateness -- yielding recall up to 96% and low
regression errors.
