A Corpus-based Evaluation of a Domain-specific Text to Knowledge Mapping
  Prototype
The aim of this paper is to evaluate a Text to Knowledge Mapping (TKM)
Prototype. The prototype is domain-specific, the purpose of which is to map
instructional text onto a knowledge domain. The context of the knowledge domain
is DC electrical circuit. During development, the prototype has been tested
with a limited data set from the domain. The prototype reached a stage where it
needs to be evaluated with a representative linguistic data set called corpus.
A corpus is a collection of text drawn from typical sources which can be used
as a test data set to evaluate NLP systems. As there is no available corpus for
the domain, we developed and annotated a representative corpus. The evaluation
of the prototype considers two of its major components- lexical components and
knowledge model. Evaluation on lexical components enriches the lexical
resources of the prototype like vocabulary and grammar structures. This leads
the prototype to parse a reasonable amount of sentences in the corpus. While
dealing with the lexicon was straight forward, the identification and
extraction of appropriate semantic relations was much more involved. It was
necessary, therefore, to manually develop a conceptual structure for the domain
to formulate a domain-specific framework of semantic relations. The framework
of semantic relationsthat has resulted from this study consisted of 55
relations, out of which 42 have inverse relations. We also conducted rhetorical
analysis on the corpus to prove its representativeness in conveying semantic.
Finally, we conducted a topical and discourse analysis on the corpus to analyze
the coverage of discourse by the prototype.
