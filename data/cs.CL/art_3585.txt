Enrichment of OntoSenseNet: Adding a Sense-annotated Telugu lexicon
The paper describes the enrichment of OntoSenseNet - a verb-centric lexical
resource for Indian Languages. This resource contains a newly developed
Telugu-Telugu dictionary. It is important because native speakers can better
annotate the senses when both the word and its meaning are in Telugu. Hence
efforts are made to develop a soft copy of Telugu dictionary. Our resource also
has manually annotated gold standard corpus consisting 8483 verbs, 253 adverbs
and 1673 adjectives. Annotations are done by native speakers according to
defined annotation guidelines. In this paper, we provide an overview of the
annotation procedure and present the validation of our resource through
inter-annotator agreement. Concepts of sense-class and sense-type are
discussed. Additionally, we discuss the potential of lexical sense-annotated
corpora in improving word sense disambiguation (WSD) tasks. Telugu WordNet is
crowd-sourced for annotation of individual words in synsets and is compared
with the developed sense-annotated lexicon (OntoSenseNet) to examine the
improvement. Also, we present a special categorization (spatio-temporal
classification) of adjectives.
