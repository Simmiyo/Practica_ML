Automatic Catchphrase Extraction from Legal Case Documents via Scoring
  using Deep Neural Networks
In this paper, we present a method of automatic catchphrase extracting from
legal case documents. We utilize deep neural networks for constructing scoring
model of our extraction system. We achieve comparable performance with systems
using corpus-wide and citation information which we do not use in our system.
