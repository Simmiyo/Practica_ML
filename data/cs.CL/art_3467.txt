An End-to-End Goal-Oriented Dialog System with a Generative Natural
  Language Response Generation
Recently advancements in deep learning allowed the development of end-to-end
trained goal-oriented dialog systems. Although these systems already achieve
good performance, some simplifications limit their usage in real-life
scenarios.
  In this work, we address two of these limitations: ignoring positional
information and a fixed number of possible response candidates. We propose to
use positional encodings in the input to model the word order of the user
utterances. Furthermore, by using a feedforward neural network, we are able to
generate the output word by word and are no longer restricted to a fixed number
of possible response candidates. Using the positional encoding, we were able to
achieve better accuracies in the Dialog bAbI Tasks and using the feedforward
neural network for generating the response, we were able to save computation
time and space consumption.
