An empirical evaluation of AMR parsing for legal documents
Many approaches have been proposed to tackle the problem of Abstract Meaning
Representation (AMR) parsing, helps solving various natural language processing
issues recently. In our paper, we provide an overview of different methods in
AMR parsing and their performances when analyzing legal documents. We conduct
experiments of different AMR parsers on our annotated dataset extracted from
the English version of Japanese Civil Code. Our results show the limitations as
well as open a room for improvements of current parsing techniques when
applying in this complicated domain.
