Comparing two trainable grammatical relations finders
Grammatical relationships (GRs) form an important level of natural language
processing, but different sets of GRs are useful for different purposes.
Therefore, one may often only have time to obtain a small training corpus with
the desired GR annotations. On such a small training corpus, we compare two
systems. They use different learning techniques, but we find that this
difference by itself only has a minor effect. A larger factor is that in
English, a different GR length measure appears better suited for finding simple
argument GRs than for finding modifier GRs. We also find that partitioning the
data may help memory-based learning.
