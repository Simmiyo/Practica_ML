Automatic Disambiguation of French Discourse Connectives
Discourse connectives (e.g. however, because) are terms that can explicitly
convey a discourse relation within a text. While discourse connectives have
been shown to be an effective clue to automatically identify discourse
relations, they are not always used to convey such relations, thus they should
first be disambiguated between discourse-usage non-discourse-usage. In this
paper, we investigate the applicability of features proposed for the
disambiguation of English discourse connectives for French. Our results with
the French Discourse Treebank (FDTB) show that syntactic and lexical features
developed for English texts are as effective for French and allow the
disambiguation of French discourse connectives with an accuracy of 94.2%.
