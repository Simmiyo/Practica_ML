Joint PoS Tagging and Stemming for Agglutinative Languages
The number of word forms in agglutinative languages is theoretically infinite
and this variety in word forms introduces sparsity in many natural language
processing tasks. Part-of-speech tagging (PoS tagging) is one of these tasks
that often suffers from sparsity. In this paper, we present an unsupervised
Bayesian model using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for joint PoS tagging and
stemming for agglutinative languages. We use stemming to reduce sparsity in PoS
tagging. Two tasks are jointly performed to provide a mutual benefit in both
tasks. Our results show that joint POS tagging and stemming improves PoS
tagging scores. We present results for Turkish and Finnish as agglutinative
languages and English as a morphologically poor language.
