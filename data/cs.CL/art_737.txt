TBX goes TEI -- Implementing a TBX basic extension for the Text Encoding
  Initiative guidelines
This paper presents an attempt to customise the TEI (Text Encoding
Initiative) guidelines in order to offer the possibility to incorporate TBX
(TermBase eXchange) based terminological entries within any kind of TEI
documents. After presenting the general historical, conceptual and technical
contexts, we describe the various design choices we had to take while creating
this customisation, which in turn have led to make various changes in the
actual TBX serialisation. Keeping in mind the objective to provide the TEI
guidelines with, again, an onomasiological model, we try to identify the best
comprise in maintaining both the isomorphism with the existing TBX Basic
standard and the characteristics of the TEI framework.
