Cross-Lingual Dependency Parsing for Closely Related Languages -
  Helsinki's Submission to VarDial 2017
This paper describes the submission from the University of Helsinki to the
shared task on cross-lingual dependency parsing at VarDial 2017. We present
work on annotation projection and treebank translation that gave good results
for all three target languages in the test set. In particular, Slovak seems to
work well with information coming from the Czech treebank, which is in line
with related work. The attachment scores for cross-lingual models even surpass
the fully supervised models trained on the target language treebank. Croatian
is the most difficult language in the test set and the improvements over the
baseline are rather modest. Norwegian works best with information coming from
Swedish whereas Danish contributes surprisingly little.
