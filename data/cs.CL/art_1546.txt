Interpretable probabilistic embeddings: bridging the gap between topic
  models and neural networks
We consider probabilistic topic models and more recent word embedding
techniques from a perspective of learning hidden semantic representations.
Inspired by a striking similarity of the two approaches, we merge them and
learn probabilistic embeddings with online EM-algorithm on word co-occurrence
data. The resulting embeddings perform on par with Skip-Gram Negative Sampling
(SGNS) on word similarity tasks and benefit in the interpretability of the
components. Next, we learn probabilistic document embeddings that outperform
paragraph2vec on a document similarity task and require less memory and time
for training. Finally, we employ multimodal Additive Regularization of Topic
Models (ARTM) to obtain a high sparsity and learn embeddings for other
modalities, such as timestamps and categories. We observe further improvement
of word similarity performance and meaningful inter-modality similarities.
