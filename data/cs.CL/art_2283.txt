An Empirical Evaluation of Zero Resource Acoustic Unit Discovery
Acoustic unit discovery (AUD) is a process of automatically identifying a
categorical acoustic unit inventory from speech and producing corresponding
acoustic unit tokenizations. AUD provides an important avenue for unsupervised
acoustic model training in a zero resource setting where expert-provided
linguistic knowledge and transcribed speech are unavailable. Therefore, to
further facilitate zero-resource AUD process, in this paper, we demonstrate
acoustic feature representations can be significantly improved by (i)
performing linear discriminant analysis (LDA) in an unsupervised self-trained
fashion, and (ii) leveraging resources of other languages through building a
multilingual bottleneck (BN) feature extractor to give effective cross-lingual
generalization. Moreover, we perform comprehensive evaluations of AUD efficacy
on multiple downstream speech applications, and their correlated performance
suggests that AUD evaluations are feasible using different alternative language
resources when only a subset of these evaluation resources can be available in
typical zero resource applications.
