Sequence to Sequence Learning for Event Prediction
This paper presents an approach to the task of predicting an event
description from a preceding sentence in a text. Our approach explores
sequence-to-sequence learning using a bidirectional multi-layer recurrent
neural network. Our approach substantially outperforms previous work in terms
of the BLEU score on two datasets derived from WikiHow and DeScript
respectively. Since the BLEU score is not easy to interpret as a measure of
event prediction, we complement our study with a second evaluation that
exploits the rich linguistic annotation of gold paraphrase sets of events.
