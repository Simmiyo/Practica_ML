Leipzig Corpus Miner - A Text Mining Infrastructure for Qualitative Data
  Analysis
This paper presents the "Leipzig Corpus Miner", a technical infrastructure
for supporting qualitative and quantitative content analysis. The
infrastructure aims at the integration of 'close reading' procedures on
individual documents with procedures of 'distant reading', e.g. lexical
characteristics of large document collections. Therefore information retrieval
systems, lexicometric statistics and machine learning procedures are combined
in a coherent framework which enables qualitative data analysts to make use of
state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing techniques on very large document
collections. Applicability of the framework ranges from social sciences to
media studies and market research. As an example we introduce the usage of the
framework in a political science study on post-democracy and neoliberalism.
