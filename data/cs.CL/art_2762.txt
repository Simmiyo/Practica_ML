Revisiting Selectional Preferences for Coreference Resolution
Selectional preferences have long been claimed to be essential for
coreference resolution. However, they are mainly modeled only implicitly by
current coreference resolvers. We propose a dependency-based embedding model of
selectional preferences which allows fine-grained compatibility judgments with
high coverage. We show that the incorporation of our model improves coreference
resolution performance on the CoNLL dataset, matching the state-of-the-art
results of a more complex system. However, it comes with a cost that makes it
debatable how worthwhile such improvements are.
