Thematically Reinforced Explicit Semantic Analysis
We present an extended, thematically reinforced version of Gabrilovich and
Markovitch's Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA), where we obtain thematic
information through the category structure of Wikipedia. For this we first
define a notion of categorical tfidf which measures the relevance of terms in
categories. Using this measure as a weight we calculate a maximal spanning tree
of the Wikipedia corpus considered as a directed graph of pages and categories.
This tree provides us with a unique path of "most related categories" between
each page and the top of the hierarchy. We reinforce tfidf of words in a page
by aggregating it with categorical tfidfs of the nodes of these paths, and
define a thematically reinforced ESA semantic relatedness measure which is more
robust than standard ESA and less sensitive to noise caused by out-of-context
words. We apply our method to the French Wikipedia corpus, evaluate it through
a text classification on a 37.5 MB corpus of 20 French newsgroups and obtain a
precision increase of 9-10% compared with standard ESA.
