An attention-based Bi-GRU-CapsNet model for hypernymy detection between
  compound entities
Named entities are usually composable and extensible. Typical examples are
names of symptoms and diseases in medical areas. To distinguish these entities
from general entities, we name them \textit{compound entities}. In this paper,
we present an attention-based Bi-GRU-CapsNet model to detect hypernymy
relationship between compound entities. Our model consists of several important
components. To avoid the out-of-vocabulary problem, English words or Chinese
characters in compound entities are fed into the bidirectional gated recurrent
units. An attention mechanism is designed to focus on the differences between
the two compound entities. Since there are some different cases in hypernymy
relationship between compound entities, capsule network is finally employed to
decide whether the hypernymy relationship exists or not. Experimental results
demonstrate
