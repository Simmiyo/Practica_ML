Quality Estimation Of Machine Translation Outputs Through Stemming
Machine Translation is the challenging problem for Indian languages. Every
day we can see some machine translators being developed, but getting a high
quality automatic translation is still a very distant dream . The correct
translated sentence for Hindi language is rarely found. In this paper, we are
emphasizing on English-Hindi language pair, so in order to preserve the correct
MT output we present a ranking system, which employs some machine learning
techniques and morphological features. In ranking no human intervention is
required. We have also validated our results by comparing it with human
ranking.
