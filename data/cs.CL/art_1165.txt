Right Ideals of a Ring and Sublanguages of Science
Among Zellig Harris's numerous contributions to linguistics his theory of the
sublanguages of science probably ranks among the most underrated. However, not
only has this theory led to some exhaustive and meaningful applications in the
study of the grammar of immunology language and its changes over time, but it
also illustrates the nature of mathematical relations between chunks or subsets
of a grammar and the language as a whole. This becomes most clear when dealing
with the connection between metalanguage and language, as well as when
reflecting on operators.
  This paper tries to justify the claim that the sublanguages of science stand
in a particular algebraic relation to the rest of the language they are
embedded in, namely, that of right ideals in a ring.
