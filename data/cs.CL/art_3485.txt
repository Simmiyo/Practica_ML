Monitoring Targeted Hate in Online Environments
Hateful comments, swearwords and sometimes even death threats are becoming a
reality for many people today in online environments. This is especially true
for journalists, politicians, artists, and other public figures. This paper
describes how hate directed towards individuals can be measured in online
environments using a simple dictionary-based approach. We present a case study
on Swedish politicians, and use examples from this study to discuss
shortcomings of the proposed dictionary-based approach. We also outline
possibilities for potential refinements of the proposed approach.
