Learning Meta-Embeddings by Using Ensembles of Embedding Sets
Word embeddings -- distributed representations of words -- in deep learning
are beneficial for many tasks in natural language processing (NLP). However,
different embedding sets vary greatly in quality and characteristics of the
captured semantics. Instead of relying on a more advanced algorithm for
embedding learning, this paper proposes an ensemble approach of combining
different public embedding sets with the aim of learning meta-embeddings.
Experiments on word similarity and analogy tasks and on part-of-speech tagging
show better performance of meta-embeddings compared to individual embedding
sets. One advantage of meta-embeddings is the increased vocabulary coverage. We
will release our meta-embeddings publicly.
