Mathematical Model of Word Length on the Basis of the Cebanov-Fucks
  Distribution with Uniform Parameter Distribution
The data on 13 typologically different languages have been processed using a
two-parameter word length model, based on 1-displaced uniform Poisson
distribution. Statistical dependencies of the 2nd parameter on the 1st one are
revealed for the German texts and genre of letters.
