Automatic Identification of Sarcasm Target: An Introductory Approach
Past work in computational sarcasm deals primarily with sarcasm detection. In
this paper, we introduce a novel, related problem: sarcasm target
identification i.e., extracting the target of ridicule in a sarcastic
sentence). We present an introductory approach for sarcasm target
identification. Our approach employs two types of extractors: one based on
rules, and another consisting of a statistical classifier. To compare our
approach, we use two baselines: a na\"ive baseline and another baseline based
on work in sentiment target identification. We perform our experiments on book
snippets and tweets, and show that our hybrid approach performs better than the
two baselines and also, in comparison with using the two extractors
individually. Our introductory approach establishes the viability of sarcasm
target identification, and will serve as a baseline for future work.
