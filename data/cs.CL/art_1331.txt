AC-BLSTM: Asymmetric Convolutional Bidirectional LSTM Networks for Text
  Classification
Recently deeplearning models have been shown to be capable of making
remarkable performance in sentences and documents classification tasks. In this
work, we propose a novel framework called AC-BLSTM for modeling sentences and
documents, which combines the asymmetric convolution neural network (ACNN) with
the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network (BLSTM). Experiment results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on five tasks,
including sentiment analysis, question type classification, and subjectivity
classification. In order to further improve the performance of AC-BLSTM, we
propose a semi-supervised learning framework called G-AC-BLSTM for text
classification by combining the generative model with AC-BLSTM.
