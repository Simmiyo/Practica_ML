Studying the History of the Arabic Language: Language Technology and a
  Large-Scale Historical Corpus
Arabic is a widely-spoken language with a long and rich history, but existing
corpora and language technology focus mostly on modern Arabic and its
varieties. Therefore, studying the history of the language has so far been
mostly limited to manual analyses on a small scale. In this work, we present a
large-scale historical corpus of the written Arabic language, spanning 1400
years. We describe our efforts to clean and process this corpus using Arabic
NLP tools, including the identification of reused text. We study the history of
the Arabic language using a novel automatic periodization algorithm, as well as
other techniques. Our findings confirm the established division of written
Arabic into Modern Standard and Classical Arabic, and confirm other established
periodizations, while suggesting that written Arabic may be divisible into
still further periods of development.
