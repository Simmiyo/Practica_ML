Story Generation from Sequence of Independent Short Descriptions
Existing Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems are weak AI systems and
exhibit limited capabilities when language generation tasks demand higher
levels of creativity, originality and brevity. Effective solutions or, at least
evaluations of modern NLG paradigms for such creative tasks have been elusive,
unfortunately. This paper introduces and addresses the task of coherent story
generation from independent descriptions, describing a scene or an event.
Towards this, we explore along two popular text-generation paradigms -- (1)
Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), posing story generation as a translation
problem and (2) Deep Learning, posing story generation as a sequence to
sequence learning problem. In SMT, we chose two popular methods such as phrase
based SMT (PB-SMT) and syntax based SMT (SYNTAX-SMT) to `translate' the
incoherent input text into stories. We then implement a deep recurrent neural
network (RNN) architecture that encodes sequence of variable length input
descriptions to corresponding latent representations and decodes them to
produce well formed comprehensive story like summaries. The efficacy of the
suggested approaches is demonstrated on a publicly available dataset with the
help of popular machine translation and summarization evaluation metrics.
