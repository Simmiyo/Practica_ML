The First Parallel Multilingual Corpus of Persian: Toward a Persian
  BLARK
In this article, we have introduced the first parallel corpus of Persian with
more than 10 other European languages. This article describes primary steps
toward preparing a Basic Language Resources Kit (BLARK) for Persian. Up to now,
we have proposed morphosyntactic specification of Persian based on
EAGLE/MULTEXT guidelines and specific resources of MULTEXT-East. The article
introduces Persian Language, with emphasis on its orthography and
morphosyntactic features, then a new Part-of-Speech categorization and
orthography for Persian in digital environments is proposed. Finally, the
corpus and related statistic will be analyzed.
