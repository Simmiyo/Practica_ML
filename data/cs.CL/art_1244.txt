A Dynamic Window Neural Network for CCG Supertagging
Combinatory Category Grammar (CCG) supertagging is a task to assign lexical
categories to each word in a sentence. Almost all previous methods use fixed
context window sizes as input features. However, it is obvious that different
tags usually rely on different context window sizes. These motivate us to build
a supertagger with a dynamic window approach, which can be treated as an
attention mechanism on the local contexts. Applying dropout on the dynamic
filters can be seen as drop on words directly, which is superior to the regular
dropout on word embeddings. We use this approach to demonstrate the
state-of-the-art CCG supertagging performance on the standard test set.
