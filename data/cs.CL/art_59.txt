Resolution of Verb Ellipsis in Japanese Sentence using Surface
  Expressions and Examples
Verbs are sometimes omitted in Japanese sentences. It is necessary to recover
omitted verbs for purposes of language understanding, machine translation, and
conversational processing. This paper describes a practical way to recover
omitted verbs by using surface expressions and examples. We experimented the
resolution of verb ellipses by using this information, and obtained a recall
rate of 73% and a precision rate of 66% on test sentences.
