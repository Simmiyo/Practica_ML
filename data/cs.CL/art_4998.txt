Incorporating Structured Commonsense Knowledge in Story Completion
The ability to select an appropriate story ending is the first step towards
perfect narrative comprehension. Story ending prediction requires not only the
explicit clues within the context, but also the implicit knowledge (such as
commonsense) to construct a reasonable and consistent story. However, most
previous approaches do not explicitly use background commonsense knowledge. We
present a neural story ending selection model that integrates three types of
information: narrative sequence, sentiment evolution and commonsense knowledge.
Experiments show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on a
public dataset, ROCStory Cloze Task , and the performance gain from adding the
additional commonsense knowledge is significant.
