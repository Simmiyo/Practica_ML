A Survey of Neural Network Techniques for Feature Extraction from Text
This paper aims to catalyze the discussions about text feature extraction
techniques using neural network architectures. The research questions discussed
in the paper focus on the state-of-the-art neural network techniques that have
proven to be useful tools for language processing, language generation, text
classification and other computational linguistics tasks.
