Towards Multimodal Content Representation
Multimodal interfaces, combining the use of speech, graphics, gestures, and
facial expressions in input and output, promise to provide new possibilities to
deal with information in more effective and efficient ways, supporting for
instance: - the understanding of possibly imprecise, partial or ambiguous
multimodal input; - the generation of coordinated, cohesive, and coherent
multimodal presentations; - the management of multimodal interaction (e.g.,
task completion, adapting the interface, error prevention) by representing and
exploiting models of the user, the domain, the task, the interactive context,
and the media (e.g. text, audio, video). The present document is intended to
support the discussion on multimodal content representation, its possible
objectives and basic constraints, and how the definition of a generic
representation framework for multimodal content representation may be
approached. It takes into account the results of the Dagstuhl workshop, in
particular those of the informal working group on multimodal meaning
representation that was active during the workshop (see
http://www.dfki.de/~wahlster/Dagstuhl_Multi_Modality, Working Group 4).
