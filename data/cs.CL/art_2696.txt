Cross-Lingual Sentiment Analysis Without (Good) Translation
Current approaches to cross-lingual sentiment analysis try to leverage the
wealth of labeled English data using bilingual lexicons, bilingual vector space
embeddings, or machine translation systems. Here we show that it is possible to
use a single linear transformation, with as few as 2000 word pairs, to capture
fine-grained sentiment relationships between words in a cross-lingual setting.
We apply these cross-lingual sentiment models to a diverse set of tasks to
demonstrate their functionality in a non-English context. By effectively
leveraging English sentiment knowledge without the need for accurate
translation, we can analyze and extract features from other languages with
scarce data at a very low cost, thus making sentiment and related analyses for
many languages inexpensive.
