Automatic Mapping of French Discourse Connectives to PDTB Discourse
  Relations
In this paper, we present an approach to exploit phrase tables generated by
statistical machine translation in order to map French discourse connectives to
discourse relations. Using this approach, we created ConcoLeDisCo, a lexicon of
French discourse connectives and their PDTB relations. When evaluated against
LEXCONN, ConcoLeDisCo achieves a recall of 0.81 and an Average Precision of
0.68 for the Concession and Condition relations.
