Discriminative Segmental Cascades for Feature-Rich Phone Recognition
Discriminative segmental models, such as segmental conditional random fields
(SCRFs) and segmental structured support vector machines (SSVMs), have had
success in speech recognition via both lattice rescoring and first-pass
decoding. However, such models suffer from slow decoding, hampering the use of
computationally expensive features, such as segment neural networks or other
high-order features. A typical solution is to use approximate decoding, either
by beam pruning in a single pass or by beam pruning to generate a lattice
followed by a second pass. In this work, we study discriminative segmental
models trained with a hinge loss (i.e., segmental structured SVMs). We show
that beam search is not suitable for learning rescoring models in this
approach, though it gives good approximate decoding performance when the model
is already well-trained. Instead, we consider an approach inspired by
structured prediction cascades, which use max-marginal pruning to generate
lattices. We obtain a high-accuracy phonetic recognition system with several
expensive feature types: a segment neural network, a second-order language
model, and second-order phone boundary features.
