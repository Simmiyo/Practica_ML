Codeco: A Grammar Notation for Controlled Natural Language in Predictive
  Editors
Existing grammar frameworks do not work out particularly well for controlled
natural languages (CNL), especially if they are to be used in predictive
editors. I introduce in this paper a new grammar notation, called Codeco, which
is designed specifically for CNLs and predictive editors. Two different parsers
have been implemented and a large subset of Attempto Controlled English (ACE)
has been represented in Codeco. The results show that Codeco is practical,
adequate and efficient.
