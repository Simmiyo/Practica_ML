The EcoLexicon English Corpus as an open corpus in Sketch Engine
The EcoLexicon English Corpus (EEC) is a 23.1-million-word corpus of
contemporary environmental texts. It was compiled by the LexiCon research group
for the development of EcoLexicon (Faber, Leon-Arauz & Reimerink 2016; San
Martin et al. 2017), a terminological knowledge base on the environment. It is
available as an open corpus in the well-known corpus query system Sketch Engine
(Kilgarriff et al. 2014), which means that any user, even without a
subscription, can freely access and query the corpus. In this paper, the EEC is
introduced by de- scribing how it was built and compiled and how it can be
queried and exploited, based both on the functionalities provided by Sketch
Engine and on the parameters in which the texts in the EEC are classified.
