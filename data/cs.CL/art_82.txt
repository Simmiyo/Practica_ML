Finite-State Reduplication in One-Level Prosodic Morphology
Reduplication, a central instance of prosodic morphology, is particularly
challenging for state-of-the-art computational morphology, since it involves
copying of some part of a phonological string. In this paper I advocate a
finite-state method that combines enriched lexical representations via
intersection to implement the copying. The proposal includes a
resource-conscious variant of automata and can benefit from the existence of
lazy algorithms. Finally, the implementation of a complex case from Koasati is
presented.
