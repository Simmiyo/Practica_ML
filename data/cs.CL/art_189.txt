Enriching WordNet concepts with topic signatures
This paper explores the possibility of enriching the content of existing
ontologies. The overall goal is to overcome the lack of topical links among
concepts in WordNet. Each concept is to be associated to a topic signature,
i.e., a set of related words with associated weights. The signatures can be
automatically constructed from the WWW or from sense-tagged corpora. Both
approaches are compared and evaluated on a word sense disambiguation task. The
results show that it is possible to construct clean signatures from the WWW
using some filtering techniques.
