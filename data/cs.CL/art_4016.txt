Attention-Based LSTM for Psychological Stress Detection from Spoken
  Language Using Distant Supervision
We propose a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with attention mechanism to
classify psychological stress from self-conducted interview transcriptions. We
apply distant supervision by automatically labeling tweets based on their
hashtag content, which complements and expands the size of our corpus. This
additional data is used to initialize the model parameters, and which it is
fine-tuned using the interview data. This improves the model's robustness,
especially by expanding the vocabulary size. The bidirectional LSTM model with
attention is found to be the best model in terms of accuracy (74.1%) and
f-score (74.3%). Furthermore, we show that distant supervision fine-tuning
enhances the model's performance by 1.6% accuracy and 2.1% f-score. The
attention mechanism helps the model to select informative words.
