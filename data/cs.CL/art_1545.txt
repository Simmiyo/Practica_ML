Discovering conversational topics and emotions associated with
  Demonetization tweets in India
Social media platforms contain great wealth of information which provides us
opportunities explore hidden patterns or unknown correlations, and understand
people's satisfaction with what they are discussing. As one showcase, in this
paper, we summarize the data set of Twitter messages related to recent
demonetization of all Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes in India and explore insights
from Twitter's data. Our proposed system automatically extracts the popular
latent topics in conversations regarding demonetization discussed in Twitter
via the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based topic model and also identifies
the correlated topics across different categories. Additionally, it also
discovers people's opinions expressed through their tweets related to the event
under consideration via the emotion analyzer. The system also employs an
intuitive and informative visualization to show the uncovered insight.
Furthermore, we use an evaluation measure, Normalized Mutual Information (NMI),
to select the best LDA models. The obtained LDA results show that the tool can
be effectively used to extract discussion topics and summarize them for further
manual analysis.
