Heuristic Feature Selection for Clickbait Detection
We study feature selection as a means to optimize the baseline clickbait
detector employed at the Clickbait Challenge 2017. The challenge's task is to
score the "clickbaitiness" of a given Twitter tweet on a scale from 0 (no
clickbait) to 1 (strong clickbait). Unlike most other approaches submitted to
the challenge, the baseline approach is based on manual feature engineering and
does not compete out of the box with many of the deep learning-based
approaches. We show that scaling up feature selection efforts to heuristically
identify better-performing feature subsets catapults the performance of the
baseline classifier to second rank overall, beating 12 other competing
approaches and improving over the baseline performance by 20%. This
demonstrates that traditional classification approaches can still keep up with
deep learning on this task.
