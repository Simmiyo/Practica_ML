Classification of Questions and Learning Outcome Statements (LOS) Into
  Blooms Taxonomy (BT) By Similarity Measurements Towards Extracting Of
  Learning Outcome from Learning Material
Blooms Taxonomy (BT) have been used to classify the objectives of learning
outcome by dividing the learning into three different domains; the cognitive
domain, the effective domain and the psychomotor domain. In this paper, we are
introducing a new approach to classify the questions and learning outcome
statements (LOS) into Blooms taxonomy (BT) and to verify BT verb lists, which
are being cited and used by academicians to write questions and (LOS). An
experiment was designed to investigate the semantic relationship between the
action verbs used in both questions and LOS to obtain more accurate
classification of the levels of BT. A sample of 775 different action verbs
collected from different universities allows us to measure an accurate and
clear-cut cognitive level for the action verb. It is worth mentioning that
natural language processing techniques were used to develop our rules as to
induce the questions into chunks in order to extract the action verbs. Our
proposed solution was able to classify the action verb into a precise level of
the cognitive domain. We, on our side, have tested and evaluated our proposed
solution using confusion matrix. The results of evaluation tests yielded 97%
for the macro average of precision and 90% for F1. Thus, the outcome of the
research suggests that it is crucial to analyse and verify the action verbs
cited and used by academicians to write LOS and classify their questions based
on blooms taxonomy in order to obtain a definite and more accurate
classification.
