One-shot Learning for Question-Answering in Gaokao History Challenge
Answering questions from university admission exams (Gaokao in Chinese) is a
challenging AI task since it requires effective representation to capture
complicated semantic relations between questions and answers. In this work, we
propose a hybrid neural model for deep question-answering task from history
examinations. Our model employs a cooperative gated neural network to retrieve
answers with the assistance of extra labels given by a neural turing machine
labeler. Empirical study shows that the labeler works well with only a small
training dataset and the gated mechanism is good at fetching the semantic
representation of lengthy answers. Experiments on question answering
demonstrate the proposed model obtains substantial performance gains over
various neural model baselines in terms of multiple evaluation metrics.
