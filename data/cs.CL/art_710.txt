Cross-lingual Annotation Projection for Semantic Roles
This article considers the task of automatically inducing role-semantic
annotations in the FrameNet paradigm for new languages. We propose a general
framework that is based on annotation projection, phrased as a graph
optimization problem. It is relatively inexpensive and has the potential to
reduce the human effort involved in creating role-semantic resources. Within
this framework, we present projection models that exploit lexical and syntactic
information. We provide an experimental evaluation on an English-German
parallel corpus which demonstrates the feasibility of inducing high-precision
German semantic role annotation both for manually and automatically annotated
English data.
