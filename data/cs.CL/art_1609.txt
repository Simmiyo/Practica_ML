Machine Translation using Semantic Web Technologies: A Survey
A large number of machine translation approaches have recently been developed
to facilitate the fluid migration of content across languages. However, the
literature suggests that many obstacles must still be dealt with to achieve
better automatic translations. One of these obstacles is lexical and syntactic
ambiguity. A promising way of overcoming this problem is using Semantic Web
technologies. This article presents the results of a systematic review of
machine translation approaches that rely on Semantic Web technologies for
translating texts. Overall, our survey suggests that while Semantic Web
technologies can enhance the quality of machine translation outputs for various
problems, the combination of both is still in its infancy.
