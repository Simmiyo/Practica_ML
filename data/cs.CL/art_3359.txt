Order matters: Distributional properties of speech to young children
  bootstraps learning of semantic representations
Some researchers claim that language acquisition is critically dependent on
experiencing linguistic input in order of increasing complexity. We set out to
test this hypothesis using a simple recurrent neural network (SRN) trained to
predict word sequences in CHILDES, a 5-million-word corpus of speech directed
to children. First, we demonstrated that age-ordered CHILDES exhibits a gradual
increase in linguistic complexity. Next, we compared the performance of two
groups of SRNs trained on CHILDES which had either been age-ordered or not.
Specifically, we assessed learning of grammatical and semantic structure and
showed that training on age-ordered input facilitates learning of semantic, but
not of sequential structure. We found that this advantage is eliminated when
the models were trained on input with utterance boundary information removed.
