Decomposing Generalization: Models of Generic, Habitual, and Episodic
  Statements
We present a novel semantic framework for modeling linguistic expressions of
generalization---generic, habitual, and episodic statements---as combinations
of simple, real-valued referential properties of predicates and their
arguments. We use this framework to construct a dataset covering the entirety
of the Universal Dependencies English Web Treebank. We use this dataset to
probe the efficacy of type-level and token-level information---including
hand-engineered features and static (GloVe) and contextual (ELMo) word
embeddings---for predicting expressions of generalization. Data and code are
available at decomp.io.
