Semantic Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data
Internet and the proliferation of smart mobile devices have changed the way
information is created, shared, and spreads, e.g., microblogs such as Twitter,
weblogs such as LiveJournal, social networks such as Facebook, and instant
messengers such as Skype and WhatsApp are now commonly used to share thoughts
and opinions about anything in the surrounding world. This has resulted in the
proliferation of social media content, thus creating new opportunities to study
public opinion at a scale that was never possible before. Naturally, this
abundance of data has quickly attracted business and research interest from
various fields including marketing, political science, and social studies,
among many others, which are interested in questions like these: Do people like
the new Apple Watch? Do Americans support ObamaCare? How do Scottish feel about
the Brexit? Answering these questions requires studying the sentiment of
opinions people express in social media, which has given rise to the fast
growth of the field of sentiment analysis in social media, with Twitter being
especially popular for research due to its scale, representativeness, variety
of topics discussed, as well as ease of public access to its messages. Here we
present an overview of work on sentiment analysis on Twitter.
