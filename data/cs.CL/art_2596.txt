Senti17 at SemEval-2017 Task 4: Ten Convolutional Neural Network Voters
  for Tweet Polarity Classification
This paper presents Senti17 system which uses ten convolutional neural
networks (ConvNet) to assign a sentiment label to a tweet. The network consists
of a convolutional layer followed by a fully-connected layer and a Softmax on
top. Ten instances of this network are initialized with the same word
embeddings as inputs but with different initializations for the network
weights. We combine the results of all instances by selecting the sentiment
label given by the majority of the ten voters. This system is ranked fourth in
SemEval-2017 Task4 over 38 systems with 67.4%
