Using a Probabilistic Class-Based Lexicon for Lexical Ambiguity
  Resolution
This paper presents the use of probabilistic class-based lexica for
disambiguation in target-word selection. Our method employs minimal but precise
contextual information for disambiguation. That is, only information provided
by the target-verb, enriched by the condensed information of a probabilistic
class-based lexicon, is used. Induction of classes and fine-tuning to verbal
arguments is done in an unsupervised manner by EM-based clustering techniques.
The method shows promising results in an evaluation on real-world translations.
