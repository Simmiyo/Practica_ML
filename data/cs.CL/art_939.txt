Arabic Inquiry-Answer Dialogue Acts Annotation Schema
We present an annotation schema as part of an effort to create a manually
annotated corpus for Arabic dialogue language understanding including spoken
dialogue and written "chat" dialogue for inquiry-answer domain. The proposed
schema handles mainly the request and response acts that occurs frequently in
inquiry-answer debate conversations expressing request services, suggests, and
offers. We applied the proposed schema on 83 Arabic inquiry-answer dialogues.
