Detecting Reliable Novel Word Senses: A Network-Centric Approach
In this era of Big Data, due to expeditious exchange of information on the
web, words are being used to denote newer meanings, causing linguistic shift.
With the recent availability of large amounts of digitized texts, an automated
analysis of the evolution of language has become possible. Our study mainly
focuses on improving the detection of new word senses. This paper presents a
unique proposal based on network features to improve the precision of new word
sense detection. For a candidate word where a new sense (birth) has been
detected by comparing the sense clusters induced at two different time points,
we further compare the network properties of the subgraphs induced from novel
sense cluster across these two time points. Using the mean fractional change in
edge density, structural similarity and average path length as features in an
SVM classifier, manual evaluation gives precision values of 0.86 and 0.74 for
the task of new sense detection, when tested on 2 distinct time-point pairs, in
comparison to the precision values in the range of 0.23-0.32, when the proposed
scheme is not used. The outlined method can therefore be used as a new post-hoc
step to improve the precision of novel word sense detection in a robust and
reliable way where the underlying framework uses a graph structure. Another
important observation is that even though our proposal is a post-hoc step, it
can be used in isolation and that itself results in a very decent performance
achieving a precision of 0.54-0.62. Finally, we show that our method is able to
detect the well-known historical shifts in 80% cases.
