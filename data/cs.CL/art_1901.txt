Learning Word Sense Embeddings from Word Sense Definitions
Word embeddings play a significant role in many modern NLP systems. Since
learning one representation per word is problematic for polysemous words and
homonymous words, researchers propose to use one embedding per word sense.
Their approaches mainly train word sense embeddings on a corpus. In this paper,
we propose to use word sense definitions to learn one embedding per word sense.
Experimental results on word similarity tasks and a word sense disambiguation
task show that word sense embeddings produced by our approach are of high
quality.
