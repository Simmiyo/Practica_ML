Word Sense Disambiguation using WSD specific Wordnet of Polysemy Words
This paper presents a new model of WordNet that is used to disambiguate the
correct sense of polysemy word based on the clue words. The related words for
each sense of a polysemy word as well as single sense word are referred to as
the clue words. The conventional WordNet organizes nouns, verbs, adjectives and
adverbs together into sets of synonyms called synsets each expressing a
different concept. In contrast to the structure of WordNet, we developed a new
model of WordNet that organizes the different senses of polysemy words as well
as the single sense words based on the clue words. These clue words for each
sense of a polysemy word as well as for single sense word are used to
disambiguate the correct meaning of the polysemy word in the given context
using knowledge based Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) algorithms. The clue word
can be a noun, verb, adjective or adverb.
