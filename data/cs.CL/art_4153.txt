Ontology Alignment in the Biomedical Domain Using Entity Definitions and
  Context
Ontology alignment is the task of identifying semantically equivalent
entities from two given ontologies. Different ontologies have different
representations of the same entity, resulting in a need to de-duplicate
entities when merging ontologies. We propose a method for enriching entities in
an ontology with external definition and context information, and use this
additional information for ontology alignment. We develop a neural architecture
capable of encoding the additional information when available, and show that
the addition of external data results in an F1-score of 0.69 on the Ontology
Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) largebio SNOMED-NCI subtask, comparable
with the entity-level matchers in a SOTA system.
