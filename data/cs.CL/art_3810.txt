Improving Character-level Japanese-Chinese Neural Machine Translation
  with Radicals as an Additional Input Feature
In recent years, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has been proven to get
impressive results. While some additional linguistic features of input words
improve word-level NMT, any additional character features have not been used to
improve character-level NMT so far. In this paper, we show that the radicals of
Chinese characters (or kanji), as a character feature information, can be
easily provide further improvements in the character-level NMT. In experiments
on WAT2016 Japanese-Chinese scientific paper excerpt corpus (ASPEC-JP), we find
that the proposed method improves the translation quality according to two
aspects: perplexity and BLEU. The character-level NMT with the radical input
feature's model got a state-of-the-art result of 40.61 BLEU points in the test
set, which is an improvement of about 8.6 BLEU points over the best system on
the WAT2016 Japanese-to-Chinese translation subtask with ASPEC-JP. The
improvements over the character-level NMT with no additional input feature are
up to about 1.5 and 1.4 BLEU points in the development-test set and the test
set of the corpus, respectively.
