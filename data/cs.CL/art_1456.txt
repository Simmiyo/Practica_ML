Extracting Formal Models from Normative Texts
We are concerned with the analysis of normative texts - documents based on
the deontic notions of obligation, permission, and prohibition. Our goal is to
make queries about these notions and verify that a text satisfies certain
properties concerning causality of actions and timing constraints. This
requires taking the original text and building a representation (model) of it
in a formal language, in our case the C-O Diagram formalism. We present an
experimental, semi-automatic aid that helps to bridge the gap between a
normative text in natural language and its C-O Diagram representation. Our
approach consists of using dependency structures obtained from the
state-of-the-art Stanford Parser, and applying our own rules and heuristics in
order to extract the relevant components. The result is a tabular data
structure where each sentence is split into suitable fields, which can then be
converted into a C-O Diagram. The process is not fully automatic however, and
some post-editing is generally required of the user. We apply our tool and
perform experiments on documents from different domains, and report an initial
evaluation of the accuracy and feasibility of our approach.
