CANDiS: Coupled & Attention-Driven Neural Distant Supervision
Distant Supervision for Relation Extraction uses heuristically aligned text
data with an existing knowledge base as training data. The unsupervised nature
of this technique allows it to scale to web-scale relation extraction tasks, at
the expense of noise in the training data. Previous work has explored
relationships among instances of the same entity-pair to reduce this noise, but
relationships among instances across entity-pairs have not been fully
exploited. We explore the use of inter-instance couplings based on verb-phrase
and entity type similarities. We propose a novel technique, CANDiS, which casts
distant supervision using inter-instance coupling into an end-to-end neural
network model. CANDiS incorporates an attention module at the instance-level to
model the multi-instance nature of this problem. CANDiS outperforms existing
state-of-the-art techniques on a standard benchmark dataset.
