PerSum: Novel Systems for Document Summarization in Persian
In this paper we explore the problem of document summarization in Persian
language from two distinct angles. In our first approach, we modify a popular
and widely cited Persian document summarization framework to see how it works
on a realistic corpus of news articles. Human evaluation on generated summaries
shows that graph-based methods perform better than the modified systems. We
carry this intuition forward in our second approach, and probe deeper into the
nature of graph-based systems by designing several summarizers based on
centrality measures. Ad hoc evaluation using ROUGE score on these summarizers
suggests that there is a small class of centrality measures that perform better
than three strong unsupervised baselines.
