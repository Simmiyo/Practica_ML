Semantic descriptions of 24 evaluational adjectives, for application in
  sentiment analysis
We apply the Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) approach (Goddard and
Wierzbicka 2014) to the lexical-semantic analysis of English evaluational
adjectives and compare the results with the picture developed in the Appraisal
Framework (Martin and White 2005). The analysis is corpus-assisted, with
examples mainly drawn from film and book reviews, and supported by
collocational and statistical information from WordBanks Online. We propose NSM
explications for 24 evaluational adjectives, arguing that they fall into five
groups, each of which corresponds to a distinct semantic template. The groups
can be sketched as follows: "First-person thought-plus-affect", e.g. wonderful;
"Experiential", e.g. entertaining; "Experiential with bodily reaction", e.g.
gripping; "Lasting impact", e.g. memorable; "Cognitive evaluation", e.g.
complex, excellent. These groupings and semantic templates are compared with
the classifications in the Appraisal Framework's system of Appreciation. In
addition, we are particularly interested in sentiment analysis, the automatic
identification of evaluation and subjectivity in text. We discuss the relevance
of the two frameworks for sentiment analysis and other language technology
applications.
