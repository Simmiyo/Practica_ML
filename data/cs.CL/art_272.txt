A Probabilistic Model of Machine Translation
A probabilistic model for computer-based generation of a machine translation
system on the basis of English-Russian parallel text corpora is suggested. The
model is trained using parallel text corpora with pre-aligned source and target
sentences. The training of the model results in a bilingual dictionary of words
and "word blocks" with relevant translation probability.
