Design Challenges in Named Entity Transliteration
We analyze some of the fundamental design challenges that impact the
development of a multilingual state-of-the-art named entity transliteration
system, including curating bilingual named entity datasets and evaluation of
multiple transliteration methods. We empirically evaluate the transliteration
task using traditional weighted finite state transducer (WFST) approach against
two neural approaches: the encoder-decoder recurrent neural network method and
the recent, non-sequential Transformer method. In order to improve availability
of bilingual named entity transliteration datasets, we release personal name
bilingual dictionaries minded from Wikidata for English to Russian, Hebrew,
Arabic and Japanese Katakana. Our code and dictionaries are publicly available.
