Broad Context Language Modeling as Reading Comprehension
Progress in text understanding has been driven by large datasets that test
particular capabilities, like recent datasets for reading comprehension
(Hermann et al., 2015). We focus here on the LAMBADA dataset (Paperno et al.,
2016), a word prediction task requiring broader context than the immediate
sentence. We view LAMBADA as a reading comprehension problem and apply
comprehension models based on neural networks. Though these models are
constrained to choose a word from the context, they improve the state of the
art on LAMBADA from 7.3% to 49%. We analyze 100 instances, finding that neural
network readers perform well in cases that involve selecting a name from the
context based on dialogue or discourse cues but struggle when coreference
resolution or external knowledge is needed.
