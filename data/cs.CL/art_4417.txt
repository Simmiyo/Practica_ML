Analysis of Speeches in Indian Parliamentary Debates
With the increasing usage of the internet, more and more data is being
digitized including parliamentary debates but they are in an unstructured
format. There is a need to convert them into a structured format for linguistic
analysis. Much work has been done on parliamentary data such as Hansard,
American congressional floor-debate data on various aspects but less on
pragmatics. In this paper, we provide a dataset for the synopsis of Indian
parliamentary debates and perform stance classification of speeches i.e
identifying if the speaker is supporting the bill/issue or against it. We also
analyze the intention of the speeches beyond mere sentences i.e pragmatics in
the parliament. Based on thorough manual analysis of the debates, we developed
an annotation scheme of 4 mutually exclusive categories to analyze the purpose
of the speeches: to find out ISSUES, to BLAME, to APPRECIATE and for CALL FOR
ACTION. We have annotated the dataset provided, with these 4 categories and
conducted preliminary experiments for automatic detection of the categories.
Our automated classification approach gave us promising results.
