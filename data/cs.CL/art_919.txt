Bengali to Assamese Statistical Machine Translation using Moses (Corpus
  Based)
Machine dialect interpretation assumes a real part in encouraging man-machine
correspondence and in addition men-men correspondence in Natural Language
Processing (NLP). Machine Translation (MT) alludes to utilizing machine to
change one dialect to an alternate. Statistical Machine Translation is a type
of MT consisting of Language Model (LM), Translation Model (TM) and decoder. In
this paper, Bengali to Assamese Statistical Machine Translation Model has been
created by utilizing Moses. Other translation tools like IRSTLM for Language
Model and GIZA-PP-V1.0.7 for Translation model are utilized within this
framework which is accessible in Linux situations. The purpose of the LM is to
encourage fluent output and the purpose of TM is to encourage similarity
between input and output, the decoder increases the probability of translated
text in target language. A parallel corpus of 17100 sentences in Bengali and
Assamese has been utilized for preparing within this framework. Measurable MT
procedures have not so far been generally investigated for Indian dialects. It
might be intriguing to discover to what degree these models can help the
immense continuous MT deliberations in the nation.
