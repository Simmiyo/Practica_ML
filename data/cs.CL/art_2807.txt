Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus: Evaluation and Modelling of
  Verbal Associations
We present a quantitative analysis of human word association pairs and study
the types of relations presented in the associations. We put our main focus on
the correlation between response types and respondent characteristics such as
occupation and gender by contrasting syntagmatic and paradigmatic associations.
Finally, we propose a personalised distributed word association model and show
the importance of incorporating demographic factors into the models commonly
used in natural language processing.
