The Microsoft 2017 Conversational Speech Recognition System
We describe the 2017 version of Microsoft's conversational speech recognition
system, in which we update our 2016 system with recent developments in
neural-network-based acoustic and language modeling to further advance the
state of the art on the Switchboard speech recognition task. The system adds a
CNN-BLSTM acoustic model to the set of model architectures we combined
previously, and includes character-based and dialog session aware LSTM language
models in rescoring. For system combination we adopt a two-stage approach,
whereby subsets of acoustic models are first combined at the senone/frame
level, followed by a word-level voting via confusion networks. We also added a
confusion network rescoring step after system combination. The resulting system
yields a 5.1\% word error rate on the 2000 Switchboard evaluation set.
