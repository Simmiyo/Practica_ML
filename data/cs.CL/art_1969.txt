Extracting Formal Models from Normative Texts
Normative texts are documents based on the deontic notions of obligation,
permission, and prohibition. Our goal is to model such texts using the C-O
Diagram formalism, making them amenable to formal analysis, in particular
verifying that a text satisfies properties concerning causality of actions and
timing constraints. We present an experimental, semi-automatic aid to bridge
the gap between a normative text and its formal representation. Our approach
uses dependency trees combined with our own rules and heuristics for extracting
the relevant components. The resulting tabular data can then be converted into
a C-O Diagram.
