The ADAPT System Description for the IWSLT 2018 Basque to English
  Translation Task
In this paper we present the ADAPT system built for the Basque to English Low
Resource MT Evaluation Campaign. Basque is a low-resourced,
morphologically-rich language. This poses a challenge for Neural Machine
Translation models which usually achieve better performance when trained with
large sets of data.
  Accordingly, we used synthetic data to improve the translation quality
produced by a model built using only authentic data. Our proposal uses
back-translated data to: (a) create new sentences, so the system can be trained
with more data; and (b) translate sentences that are close to the test set, so
the model can be fine-tuned to the document to be translated.
