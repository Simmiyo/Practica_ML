MS-UEdin Submission to the WMT2018 APE Shared Task: Dual-Source
  Transformer for Automatic Post-Editing
This paper describes the Microsoft and University of Edinburgh submission to
the Automatic Post-editing shared task at WMT2018. Based on training data and
systems from the WMT2017 shared task, we re-implement our own models from the
last shared task and introduce improvements based on extensive parameter
sharing. Next we experiment with our implementation of dual-source transformer
models and data selection for the IT domain. Our submissions decisively wins
the SMT post-editing sub-task establishing the new state-of-the-art and is a
very close second (or equal, 16.46 vs 16.50 TER) in the NMT sub-task. Based on
the rather weak results in the NMT sub-task, we hypothesize that
neural-on-neural APE might not be actually useful.
