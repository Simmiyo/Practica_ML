Continuous multilinguality with language vectors
Most existing models for multilingual natural language processing (NLP) treat
language as a discrete category, and make predictions for either one language
or the other. In contrast, we propose using continuous vector representations
of language. We show that these can be learned efficiently with a
character-based neural language model, and used to improve inference about
language varieties not seen during training. In experiments with 1303 Bible
translations into 990 different languages, we empirically explore the capacity
of multilingual language models, and also show that the language vectors
capture genetic relationships between languages.
