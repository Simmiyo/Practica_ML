Text Summarization using Deep Learning and Ridge Regression
We develop models and extract relevant features for automatic text
summarization and investigate the performance of different models on the DUC
2001 dataset. Two different models were developed, one being a ridge regressor
and the other one was a multi-layer perceptron. The hyperparameters were varied
and their performance were noted. We segregated the summarization task into 2
main steps, the first being sentence ranking and the second step being sentence
selection. In the first step, given a document, we sort the sentences based on
their Importance, and in the second step, in order to obtain non-redundant
sentences, we weed out the sentences that are have high similarity with the
previously selected sentences.
