Many uses, many annotations for large speech corpora: Switchboard and
  TDT as case studies
This paper discusses the challenges that arise when large speech corpora
receive an ever-broadening range of diverse and distinct annotations. Two case
studies of this process are presented: the Switchboard Corpus of telephone
conversations and the TDT2 corpus of broadcast news. Switchboard has undergone
two independent transcriptions and various types of additional annotation, all
carried out as separate projects that were dispersed both geographically and
chronologically. The TDT2 corpus has also received a variety of annotations,
but all directly created or managed by a core group. In both cases, issues
arise involving the propagation of repairs, consistency of references, and the
ability to integrate annotations having different formats and levels of detail.
We describe a general framework whereby these issues can be addressed
successfully.
