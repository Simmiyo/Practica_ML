Query Expansion: Term Selection using the EWC Semantic Relatedness
  Measure
This paper investigates the efficiency of the EWC semantic relatedness
measure in an ad-hoc retrieval task. This measure combines the Wikipedia-based
Explicit Semantic Analysis measure, the WordNet path measure and the mixed
collocation index. In the experiments, the open source search engine Terrier
was utilised as a tool to index and retrieve data. The proposed technique was
tested on the NTCIR data collection. The experiments demonstrated promising
results.
