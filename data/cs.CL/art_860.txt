Rediscovering the Alphabet - On the Innate Universal Grammar
Universal Grammar (UG) theory has been one of the most important research
topics in linguistics since introduced five decades ago. UG specifies the
restricted set of languages learnable by human brain, and thus, many
researchers believe in its biological roots. Numerous empirical studies of
neurobiological and cognitive functions of the human brain, and of many natural
languages, have been conducted to unveil some aspects of UG. This, however,
resulted in different and sometimes contradicting theories that do not indicate
a universally unique grammar. In this research, we tackle the UG problem from
an entirely different perspective. We search for the Unique Universal Grammar
(UUG) that facilitates communication and knowledge transfer, the sole purpose
of a language. We formulate this UG and show that it is unique, intrinsic, and
cosmic, rather than humanistic. Initial analysis on a widespread natural
language already showed some positive results.
