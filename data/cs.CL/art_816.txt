Computational Algorithms Based on the Paninian System to Process
  Euphonic Conjunctions for Word Searches
Searching for words in Sanskrit E-text is a problem that is accompanied by
complexities introduced by features of Sanskrit such as euphonic conjunctions
or sandhis. A word could occur in an E-text in a transformed form owing to the
operation of rules of sandhi. Simple word search would not yield these
transformed forms of the word. Further, there is no search engine in the
literature that can comprehensively search for words in Sanskrit E-texts taking
euphonic conjunctions into account. This work presents an optimal binary
representational schema for letters of the Sanskrit alphabet along with
algorithms to efficiently process the sandhi rules of Sanskrit grammar. The
work further presents an algorithm that uses the sandhi processing algorithm to
perform a comprehensive word search on E-text.
