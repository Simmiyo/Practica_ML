"The Sum of Its Parts": Joint Learning of Word and Phrase
  Representations with Autoencoders
Recently, there has been a lot of effort to represent words in continuous
vector spaces. Those representations have been shown to capture both semantic
and syntactic information about words. However, distributed representations of
phrases remain a challenge. We introduce a novel model that jointly learns word
vector representations and their summation. Word representations are learnt
using the word co-occurrence statistical information. To embed sequences of
words (i.e. phrases) with different sizes into a common semantic space, we
propose to average word vector representations. In contrast with previous
methods which reported a posteriori some compositionality aspects by simple
summation, we simultaneously train words to sum, while keeping the maximum
information from the original vectors. We evaluate the quality of the word
representations on several classical word evaluation tasks, and we introduce a
novel task to evaluate the quality of the phrase representations. While our
distributed representations compete with other methods of learning word
representations on word evaluations, we show that they give better performance
on the phrase evaluation. Such representations of phrases could be interesting
for many tasks in natural language processing.
