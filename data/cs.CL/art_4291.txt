A small Griko-Italian speech translation corpus
This paper presents an extension to a very low-resource parallel corpus
collected in an endangered language, Griko, making it useful for computational
research. The corpus consists of 330 utterances (about 20 minutes of speech)
which have been transcribed and translated in Italian, with annotations for
word-level speech-to-transcription and speech-to-translation alignments. The
corpus also includes morphosyntactic tags and word-level glosses. Applying an
automatic unit discovery method, pseudo-phones were also generated. We detail
how the corpus was collected, cleaned and processed, and we illustrate its use
on zero-resource tasks by presenting some baseline results for the task of
speech-to-translation alignment and unsupervised word discovery. The dataset is
available online, aiming to encourage replicability and diversity in
computational language documentation experiments.
