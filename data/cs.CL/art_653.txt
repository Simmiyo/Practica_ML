An introduction to the Europe Media Monitor family of applications
Most large organizations have dedicated departments that monitor the media to
keep up-to-date with relevant developments and to keep an eye on how they are
represented in the news. Part of this media monitoring work can be automated.
In the European Union with its 23 official languages, it is particularly
important to cover media reports in many languages in order to capture the
complementary news content published in the different countries. It is also
important to be able to access the news content across languages and to merge
the extracted information. We present here the four publicly accessible systems
of the Europe Media Monitor (EMM) family of applications, which cover between
19 and 50 languages (see http://press.jrc.it/overview.html). We give an
overview of their functionality and discuss some of the implications of the
fact that they cover quite so many languages. We discuss design issues
necessary to be able to achieve this high multilinguality, as well as the
benefits of this multilinguality.
