Polarity and Intensity: the Two Aspects of Sentiment Analysis
Current multimodal sentiment analysis frames sentiment score prediction as a
general Machine Learning task. However, what the sentiment score actually
represents has often been overlooked. As a measurement of opinions and
affective states, a sentiment score generally consists of two aspects: polarity
and intensity. We decompose sentiment scores into these two aspects and study
how they are conveyed through individual modalities and combined multimodal
models in a naturalistic monologue setting. In particular, we build unimodal
and multimodal multi-task learning models with sentiment score prediction as
the main task and polarity and/or intensity classification as the auxiliary
tasks. Our experiments show that sentiment analysis benefits from multi-task
learning, and individual modalities differ when conveying the polarity and
intensity aspects of sentiment.
