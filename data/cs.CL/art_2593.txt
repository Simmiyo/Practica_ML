A Finite State and Rule-based Akshara to Prosodeme (A2P) Converter in
  Hindi
This article describes a software module called Akshara to Prosodeme (A2P)
converter in Hindi. It converts an input grapheme into prosedeme (sequence of
phonemes with the specification of syllable boundaries and prosodic labels).
The software is based on two proposed finite state machines\textemdash one for
the syllabification and another for the syllable labeling. In addition to that,
it also uses a set of nonlinear phonological rules proposed for foot formation
in Hindi, which encompass solutions to schwa-deletion in simple, compound,
derived and inflected words. The nonlinear phonological rules are based on
metrical phonology with the provision of recursive foot structure. A software
module is implemented in Python. The testing of the software for
syllabification, syllable labeling, schwa deletion and prosodic labeling yield
an accuracy of more than 99% on a lexicon of size 28664 words.
