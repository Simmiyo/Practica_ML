DROP: A Reading Comprehension Benchmark Requiring Discrete Reasoning
  Over Paragraphs
Reading comprehension has recently seen rapid progress, with systems matching
humans on the most popular datasets for the task. However, a large body of work
has highlighted the brittleness of these systems, showing that there is much
work left to be done. We introduce a new English reading comprehension
benchmark, DROP, which requires Discrete Reasoning Over the content of
Paragraphs. In this crowdsourced, adversarially-created, 96k-question
benchmark, a system must resolve references in a question, perhaps to multiple
input positions, and perform discrete operations over them (such as addition,
counting, or sorting). These operations require a much more comprehensive
understanding of the content of paragraphs than what was necessary for prior
datasets. We apply state-of-the-art methods from both the reading comprehension
and semantic parsing literature on this dataset and show that the best systems
only achieve 32.7% F1 on our generalized accuracy metric, while expert human
performance is 96.0%. We additionally present a new model that combines reading
comprehension methods with simple numerical reasoning to achieve 47.0% F1.
