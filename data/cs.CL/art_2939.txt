PersonaBank: A Corpus of Personal Narratives and Their Story Intention
  Graphs
We present a new corpus, PersonaBank, consisting of 108 personal stories from
weblogs that have been annotated with their Story Intention Graphs, a deep
representation of the fabula of a story. We describe the topics of the stories
and the basis of the Story Intention Graph representation, as well as the
process of annotating the stories to produce the Story Intention Graphs and the
challenges of adapting the tool to this new personal narrative domain We also
discuss how the corpus can be used in applications that retell the story using
different styles of tellings, co-tellings, or as a content planner.
