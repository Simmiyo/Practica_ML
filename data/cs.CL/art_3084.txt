Robust Tuning Datasets for Statistical Machine Translation
We explore the idea of automatically crafting a tuning dataset for
Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) that makes the hyper-parameters of the
SMT system more robust with respect to some specific deficiencies of the
parameter tuning algorithms. This is an under-explored research direction,
which can allow better parameter tuning. In this paper, we achieve this goal by
selecting a subset of the available sentence pairs, which are more suitable for
specific combinations of optimizers, objective functions, and evaluation
measures. We demonstrate the potential of the idea with the pairwise ranking
optimization (PRO) optimizer, which is known to yield too short translations.
We show that the learning problem can be alleviated by tuning on a subset of
the development set, selected based on sentence length. In particular, using
the longest 50% of the tuning sentences, we achieve two-fold tuning speedup,
and improvements in BLEU score that rival those of alternatives, which fix
BLEU+1's smoothing instead.
