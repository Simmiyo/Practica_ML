Answering Subcognitive Turing Test Questions: A Reply to French
Robert French has argued that a disembodied computer is incapable of passing
a Turing Test that includes subcognitive questions. Subcognitive questions are
designed to probe the network of cultural and perceptual associations that
humans naturally develop as we live, embodied and embedded in the world. In
this paper, I show how it is possible for a disembodied computer to answer
subcognitive questions appropriately, contrary to French's claim. My approach
to answering subcognitive questions is to use statistical information extracted
from a very large collection of text. In particular, I show how it is possible
to answer a sample of subcognitive questions taken from French, by issuing
queries to a search engine that indexes about 350 million Web pages. This
simple algorithm may shed light on the nature of human (sub-) cognition, but
the scope of this paper is limited to demonstrating that French is mistaken: a
disembodied computer can answer subcognitive questions.
