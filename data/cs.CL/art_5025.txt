Semi-Supervised Confidence Network aided Gated Attention based Recurrent
  Neural Network for Clickbait Detection
Clickbaits are catchy headlines that are frequently used by social media
outlets in order to allure its viewers into clicking them and thus leading them
to dubious content. Such venal schemes thrive on exploiting the curiosity of
naive social media users, directing traffic to web pages that won't be visited
otherwise. In this paper, we propose a novel, semi-supervised classification
based approach, that employs attentions sampled from a Gumbel-Softmax
distribution to distill contexts that are fairly important in clickbait
detection. An additional loss over the attention weights is used to encode
prior knowledge. Furthermore, we propose a confidence network that enables
learning over weak labels and improves robustness to noisy labels. We show that
with merely 30% of strongly labeled samples we can achieve over 97% of the
accuracy, of current state of the art methods in clickbait detection.
