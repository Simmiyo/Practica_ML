A Method for Modeling Co-Occurrence Propensity of Clinical Codes with
  Application to ICD-10-PCS Auto-Coding
Objective. Natural language processing methods for medical auto-coding, or
automatic generation of medical billing codes from electronic health records,
generally assign each code independently of the others. They may thus assign
codes for closely related procedures or diagnoses to the same document, even
when they do not tend to occur together in practice, simply because the right
choice can be difficult to infer from the clinical narrative.
  Materials and Methods. We propose a method that injects awareness of the
propensities for code co-occurrence into this process. First, a model is
trained to estimate the conditional probability that one code is assigned by a
human coder, given than another code is known to have been assigned to the same
document. Then, at runtime, an iterative algorithm is used to apply this model
to the output of an existing statistical auto-coder to modify the confidence
scores of the codes.
  Results. We tested this method in combination with a primary auto-coder for
ICD-10 procedure codes, achieving a 12% relative improvement in F-score over
the primary auto-coder baseline.
  Discussion. The proposed method can be used, with appropriate features, in
combination with any auto-coder that generates codes with different levels of
confidence.
  Conclusion. The promising results obtained for ICD-10 procedure codes suggest
that the proposed method may have wider applications in auto-coding.
