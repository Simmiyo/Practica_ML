Addressee and Response Selection for Multilingual Conversation
Developing conversational systems that can converse in many languages is an
interesting challenge for natural language processing. In this paper, we
introduce multilingual addressee and response selection. In this task, a
conversational system predicts an appropriate addressee and response for an
input message in multiple languages. A key to developing such multilingual
responding systems is how to utilize high-resource language data to compensate
for low-resource language data. We present several knowledge transfer methods
for conversational systems. To evaluate our methods, we create a new
multilingual conversation dataset. Experiments on the dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of our methods.
