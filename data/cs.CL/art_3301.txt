MilkQA: a Dataset of Consumer Questions for the Task of Answer Selection
We introduce MilkQA, a question answering dataset from the dairy domain
dedicated to the study of consumer questions. The dataset contains 2,657 pairs
of questions and answers, written in the Portuguese language and originally
collected by the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa). All
questions were motivated by real situations and written by thousands of authors
with very different backgrounds and levels of literacy, while answers were
elaborated by specialists from Embrapa's customer service. Our dataset was
filtered and anonymized by three human annotators. Consumer questions are a
challenging kind of question that is usually employed as a form of seeking
information. Although several question answering datasets are available, most
of such resources are not suitable for research on answer selection models for
consumer questions. We aim to fill this gap by making MilkQA publicly
available. We study the behavior of four answer selection models on MilkQA: two
baseline models and two convolutional neural network archictetures. Our results
show that MilkQA poses real challenges to computational models, particularly
due to linguistic characteristics of its questions and to their unusually
longer lengths. Only one of the experimented models gives reasonable results,
at the cost of high computational requirements.
