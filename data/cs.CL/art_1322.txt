Answering Complicated Question Intents Expressed in Decomposed Question
  Sequences
Recent work in semantic parsing for question answering has focused on long
and complicated questions, many of which would seem unnatural if asked in a
normal conversation between two humans. In an effort to explore a
conversational QA setting, we present a more realistic task: answering
sequences of simple but inter-related questions. We collect a dataset of 6,066
question sequences that inquire about semi-structured tables from Wikipedia,
with 17,553 question-answer pairs in total. Existing QA systems face two major
problems when evaluated on our dataset: (1) handling questions that contain
coreferences to previous questions or answers, and (2) matching words or
phrases in a question to corresponding entries in the associated table. We
conclude by proposing strategies to handle both of these issues.
