Combining Knowledge- and Corpus-based Word-Sense-Disambiguation Methods
In this paper we concentrate on the resolution of the lexical ambiguity that
arises when a given word has several different meanings. This specific task is
commonly referred to as word sense disambiguation (WSD). The task of WSD
consists of assigning the correct sense to words using an electronic dictionary
as the source of word definitions. We present two WSD methods based on two main
methodological approaches in this research area: a knowledge-based method and a
corpus-based method. Our hypothesis is that word-sense disambiguation requires
several knowledge sources in order to solve the semantic ambiguity of the
words. These sources can be of different kinds--- for example, syntagmatic,
paradigmatic or statistical information. Our approach combines various sources
of knowledge, through combinations of the two WSD methods mentioned above.
Mainly, the paper concentrates on how to combine these methods and sources of
information in order to achieve good results in the disambiguation. Finally,
this paper presents a comprehensive study and experimental work on evaluation
of the methods and their combinations.
