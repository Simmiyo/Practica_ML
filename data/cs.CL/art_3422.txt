RDF2PT: Generating Brazilian Portuguese Texts from RDF Data
The generation of natural language from Resource Description Framework (RDF)
data has recently gained significant attention due to the continuous growth of
Linked Data. A number of these approaches generate natural language in
languages other than English, however, no work has been proposed to generate
Brazilian Portuguese texts out of RDF. We address this research gap by
presenting RDF2PT, an approach that verbalizes RDF data to Brazilian Portuguese
language. We evaluated RDF2PT in an open questionnaire with 44 native speakers
divided into experts and non-experts. Our results suggest that RDF2PT is able
to generate text which is similar to that generated by humans and can hence be
easily understood.
