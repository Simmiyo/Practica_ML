Stochastic Language Generation in Dialogue using Recurrent Neural
  Networks with Convolutional Sentence Reranking
The natural language generation (NLG) component of a spoken dialogue system
(SDS) usually needs a substantial amount of handcrafting or a well-labeled
dataset to be trained on. These limitations add significantly to development
costs and make cross-domain, multi-lingual dialogue systems intractable.
Moreover, human languages are context-aware. The most natural response should
be directly learned from data rather than depending on predefined syntaxes or
rules. This paper presents a statistical language generator based on a joint
recurrent and convolutional neural network structure which can be trained on
dialogue act-utterance pairs without any semantic alignments or predefined
grammar trees. Objective metrics suggest that this new model outperforms
previous methods under the same experimental conditions. Results of an
evaluation by human judges indicate that it produces not only high quality but
linguistically varied utterances which are preferred compared to n-gram and
rule-based systems.
