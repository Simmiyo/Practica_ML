Automatic semantic role labeling on non-revised syntactic trees of
  journalistic texts
Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is a Natural Language Processing task that
enables the detection of events described in sentences and the participants of
these events. For Brazilian Portuguese (BP), there are two studies recently
concluded that perform SRL in journalistic texts. [1] obtained F1-measure
scores of 79.6, using the PropBank.Br corpus, which has syntactic trees
manually revised, [8], without using a treebank for training, obtained
F1-measure scores of 68.0 for the same corpus. However, the use of manually
revised syntactic trees for this task does not represent a real scenario of
application. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the performance of SRL on
revised and non-revised syntactic trees using a larger and balanced corpus of
BP journalistic texts. First, we have shown that [1]'s system also performs
better than [8]'s system on the larger corpus. Second, the SRL system trained
on non-revised syntactic trees performs better over non-revised trees than a
system trained on gold-standard data.
