Latent Tree Learning with Differentiable Parsers: Shift-Reduce Parsing
  and Chart Parsing
Latent tree learning models represent sentences by composing their words
according to an induced parse tree, all based on a downstream task. These
models often outperform baselines which use (externally provided) syntax trees
to drive the composition order. This work contributes (a) a new latent tree
learning model based on shift-reduce parsing, with competitive downstream
performance and non-trivial induced trees, and (b) an analysis of the trees
learned by our shift-reduce model and by a chart-based model.
