EiTAKA at SemEval-2018 Task 1: An Ensemble of N-Channels ConvNet and
  XGboost Regressors for Emotion Analysis of Tweets
This paper describes our system that has been used in Task1 Affect in Tweets.
We combine two different approaches. The first one called N-Stream ConvNets,
which is a deep learning approach where the second one is XGboost regresseor
based on a set of embedding and lexicons based features. Our system was
evaluated on the testing sets of the tasks outperforming all other approaches
for the Arabic version of valence intensity regression task and valence ordinal
classification task.
