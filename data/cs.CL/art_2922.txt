A rule based algorithm for detecting negative words in Persian
In this paper, we present a novel method for detecting negative words in
Persian. We first used an algorithm to an exceptions list which was later
modified by hand. We then used the mentioned lists and a Persian polarity
corpus in our rule based algorithm to detect negative words.
