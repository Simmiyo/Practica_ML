Handling non-compositionality in multilingual CNLs
In this paper, we describe methods for handling multilingual
non-compositional constructions in the framework of GF. We specifically look at
methods to detect and extract non-compositional phrases from parallel texts and
propose methods to handle such constructions in GF grammars. We expect that the
methods to handle non-compositional constructions will enrich CNLs by providing
more flexibility in the design of controlled languages. We look at two specific
use cases of non-compositional constructions: a general-purpose method to
detect and extract multilingual multiword expressions and a procedure to
identify nominal compounds in German. We evaluate our procedure for multiword
expressions by performing a qualitative analysis of the results. For the
experiments on nominal compounds, we incorporate the detected compounds in a
full SMT pipeline and evaluate the impact of our method in machine translation
process.
