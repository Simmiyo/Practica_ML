A Classification of Adjectives for Polarity Lexicons Enhancement
Subjective language detection is one of the most important challenges in
Sentiment Analysis. Because of the weight and frequency in opinionated texts,
adjectives are considered a key piece in the opinion extraction process. These
subjective units are more and more frequently collected in polarity lexicons in
which they appear annotated with their prior polarity. However, at the moment,
any polarity lexicon takes into account prior polarity variations across
domains. This paper proves that a majority of adjectives change their prior
polarity value depending on the domain. We propose a distinction between domain
dependent and domain independent adjectives. Moreover, our analysis led us to
propose a further classification related to subjectivity degree: constant,
mixed and highly subjective adjectives. Following this classification, polarity
values will be a better support for Sentiment Analysis.
