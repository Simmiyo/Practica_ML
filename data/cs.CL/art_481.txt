Automatic transcription of 17th century English text in Contemporary
  English with NooJ: Method and Evaluation
Since 2006 we have undertaken to describe the differences between 17th
century English and contemporary English thanks to NLP software. Studying a
corpus spanning the whole century (tales of English travellers in the Ottoman
Empire in the 17th century, Mary Astell's essay A Serious Proposal to the
Ladies and other literary texts) has enabled us to highlight various lexical,
morphological or grammatical singularities. Thanks to the NooJ linguistic
platform, we created dictionaries indexing the lexical variants and their
transcription in CE. The latter is often the result of the validation of forms
recognized dynamically by morphological graphs. We also built syntactical
graphs aimed at transcribing certain archaic forms in contemporary English. Our
previous research implied a succession of elementary steps alternating textual
analysis and result validation. We managed to provide examples of
transcriptions, but we have not created a global tool for automatic
transcription. Therefore we need to focus on the results we have obtained so
far, study the conditions for creating such a tool, and analyze possible
difficulties. In this paper, we will be discussing the technical and linguistic
aspects we have not yet covered in our previous work. We are using the results
of previous research and proposing a transcription method for words or
sequences identified as archaic.
