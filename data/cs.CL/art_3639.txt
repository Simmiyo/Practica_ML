Similarity between Learning Outcomes from Course Objectives using
  Semantic Analysis, Blooms taxonomy and Corpus statistics
The course description provided by instructors is an essential piece of
information as it defines what is expected from the instructor and what he/she
is going to deliver during a particular course. One of the key components of a
course description is the Learning Objectives section. The contents of this
section are used by program managers who are tasked to compare and match two
different courses during the development of Transfer Agreements between various
institutions. This research introduces the development of semantic similarity
algorithms to calculate the similarity between two learning objectives of the
same domain. We present a novel methodology which deals with the semantic
similarity by using a previously established algorithm and integrating it with
the domain corpus utilizing domain statistics. The disambiguated domain serves
as a supervised learning data for the algorithm. We also introduce Bloom Index
to calculate the similarity between action verbs in the Learning Objectives
referring to the Blooms taxonomy.
