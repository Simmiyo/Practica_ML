Bootstrapping Multilingual Intent Models via Machine Translation for
  Dialog Automation
With the resurgence of chat-based dialog systems in consumer and enterprise
applications, there has been much success in developing data-driven and
rule-based natural language models to understand human intent. Since these
models require large amounts of data and in-domain knowledge, expanding an
equivalent service into new markets is disrupted by language barriers that
inhibit dialog automation.
  This paper presents a user study to evaluate the utility of out-of-the-box
machine translation technology to (1) rapidly bootstrap multilingual spoken
dialog systems and (2) enable existing human analysts to understand foreign
language utterances. We additionally evaluate the utility of machine
translation in human assisted environments, where a portion of the traffic is
processed by analysts. In English->Spanish experiments, we observe a high
potential for dialog automation, as well as the potential for human analysts to
process foreign language utterances with high accuracy.
