Auto-Encoding Variational Neural Machine Translation
We present a deep generative model of bilingual sentence pairs for machine
translation. The model generates source and target sentences jointly from a
shared latent representation and is parameterised by neural networks. We
perform efficient training using amortised variational inference and
reparameterised gradients. Additionally, we discuss the statistical
implications of joint modelling and propose an efficient approximation to
maximum a posteriori decoding for fast test-time predictions. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our model in three machine translation scenarios:
in-domain training, mixed-domain training, and learning from a mix of
gold-standard and synthetic data. Our experiments show consistently that our
joint formulation outperforms conditional modelling (i.e. standard neural
machine translation) in all such scenarios.
