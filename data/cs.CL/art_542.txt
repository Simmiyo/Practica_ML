FASTSUBS: An Efficient and Exact Procedure for Finding the Most Likely
  Lexical Substitutes Based on an N-gram Language Model
Lexical substitutes have found use in areas such as paraphrasing, text
simplification, machine translation, word sense disambiguation, and part of
speech induction. However the computational complexity of accurately
identifying the most likely substitutes for a word has made large scale
experiments difficult. In this paper I introduce a new search algorithm,
FASTSUBS, that is guaranteed to find the K most likely lexical substitutes for
a given word in a sentence based on an n-gram language model. The computation
is sub-linear in both K and the vocabulary size V. An implementation of the
algorithm and a dataset with the top 100 substitutes of each token in the WSJ
section of the Penn Treebank are available at http://goo.gl/jzKH0.
