Combined Acoustic and Pronunciation Modelling for Non-Native Speech
  Recognition
In this paper, we present several adaptation methods for non-native speech
recognition. We have tested pronunciation modelling, MLLR and MAP non-native
pronunciation adaptation and HMM models retraining on the HIWIRE foreign
accented English speech database. The ``phonetic confusion'' scheme we have
developed consists in associating to each spoken phone several sequences of
confused phones. In our experiments, we have used different combinations of
acoustic models representing the canonical and the foreign pronunciations:
spoken and native models, models adapted to the non-native accent with MAP and
MLLR. The joint use of pronunciation modelling and acoustic adaptation led to
further improvements in recognition accuracy. The best combination of the above
mentioned techniques resulted in a relative word error reduction ranging from
46% to 71%.
