Automatic Identification of Closely-related Indian Languages: Resources
  and Experiments
In this paper, we discuss an attempt to develop an automatic language
identification system for 5 closely-related Indo-Aryan languages of India,
Awadhi, Bhojpuri, Braj, Hindi and Magahi. We have compiled a comparable corpora
of varying length for these languages from various resources. We discuss the
method of creation of these corpora in detail. Using these corpora, a language
identification system was developed, which currently gives state of the art
accuracy of 96.48\%. We also used these corpora to study the similarity between
the 5 languages at the lexical level, which is the first data-based study of
the extent of closeness of these languages.
