Creation of an Annotated Corpus of Spanish Radiology Reports
This paper presents a new annotated corpus of 513 anonymized radiology
reports written in Spanish. Reports were manually annotated with entities,
negation and uncertainty terms and relations. The corpus was conceived as an
evaluation resource for named entity recognition and relation extraction
algorithms, and as input for the use of supervised methods. Biomedical
annotated resources are scarce due to confidentiality issues and associated
costs. This work provides some guidelines that could help other researchers to
undertake similar tasks.
