How do you correct run-on sentences it's not as easy as it seems
Run-on sentences are common grammatical mistakes but little research has
tackled this problem to date. This work introduces two machine learning models
to correct run-on sentences that outperform leading methods for related tasks,
punctuation restoration and whole-sentence grammatical error correction. Due to
the limited annotated data for this error, we experiment with artificially
generating training data from clean newswire text. Our findings suggest
artificial training data is viable for this task. We discuss implications for
correcting run-ons and other types of mistakes that have low coverage in
error-annotated corpora.
