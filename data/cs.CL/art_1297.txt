A Deeper Look into Sarcastic Tweets Using Deep Convolutional Neural
  Networks
Sarcasm detection is a key task for many natural language processing tasks.
In sentiment analysis, for example, sarcasm can flip the polarity of an
"apparently positive" sentence and, hence, negatively affect polarity detection
performance. To date, most approaches to sarcasm detection have treated the
task primarily as a text categorization problem. Sarcasm, however, can be
expressed in very subtle ways and requires a deeper understanding of natural
language that standard text categorization techniques cannot grasp. In this
work, we develop models based on a pre-trained convolutional neural network for
extracting sentiment, emotion and personality features for sarcasm detection.
Such features, along with the network's baseline features, allow the proposed
models to outperform the state of the art on benchmark datasets. We also
address the often ignored generalizability issue of classifying data that have
not been seen by the models at learning phase.
