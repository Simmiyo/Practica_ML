Language classification from bilingual word embedding graphs
We study the role of the second language in bilingual word embeddings in
monolingual semantic evaluation tasks. We find strongly and weakly positive
correlations between down-stream task performance and second language
similarity to the target language. Additionally, we show how bilingual word
embeddings can be employed for the task of semantic language classification and
that joint semantic spaces vary in meaningful ways across second languages. Our
results support the hypothesis that semantic language similarity is influenced
by both structural similarity as well as geography/contact.
