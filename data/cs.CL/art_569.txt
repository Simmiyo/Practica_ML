Extraction of domain-specific bilingual lexicon from comparable corpora:
  compositional translation and ranking
This paper proposes a method for extracting translations of morphologically
constructed terms from comparable corpora. The method is based on compositional
translation and exploits translation equivalences at the morpheme-level, which
allows for the generation of "fertile" translations (translation pairs in which
the target term has more words than the source term). Ranking methods relying
on corpus-based and translation-based features are used to select the best
candidate translation. We obtain an average precision of 91% on the Top1
candidate translation. The method was tested on two language pairs
(English-French and English-German) and with a small specialized comparable
corpora (400k words per language).
