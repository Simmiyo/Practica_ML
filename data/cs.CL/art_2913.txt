An End-to-End Trainable Neural Network Model with Belief Tracking for
  Task-Oriented Dialog
We present a novel end-to-end trainable neural network model for
task-oriented dialog systems. The model is able to track dialog state, issue
API calls to knowledge base (KB), and incorporate structured KB query results
into system responses to successfully complete task-oriented dialogs. The
proposed model produces well-structured system responses by jointly learning
belief tracking and KB result processing conditioning on the dialog history. We
evaluate the model in a restaurant search domain using a dataset that is
converted from the second Dialog State Tracking Challenge (DSTC2) corpus.
Experiment results show that the proposed model can robustly track dialog state
given the dialog history. Moreover, our model demonstrates promising results in
producing appropriate system responses, outperforming prior end-to-end
trainable neural network models using per-response accuracy evaluation metrics.
