This before That: Causal Precedence in the Biomedical Domain
Causal precedence between biochemical interactions is crucial in the
biomedical domain, because it transforms collections of individual
interactions, e.g., bindings and phosphorylations, into the causal mechanisms
needed to inform meaningful search and inference. Here, we analyze causal
precedence in the biomedical domain as distinct from open-domain, temporal
precedence. First, we describe a novel, hand-annotated text corpus of causal
precedence in the biomedical domain. Second, we use this corpus to investigate
a battery of models of precedence, covering rule-based, feature-based, and
latent representation models. The highest-performing individual model achieved
a micro F1 of 43 points, approaching the best performers on the simpler
temporal-only precedence tasks. Feature-based and latent representation models
each outperform the rule-based models, but their performance is complementary
to one another. We apply a sieve-based architecture to capitalize on this lack
of overlap, achieving a micro F1 score of 46 points.
