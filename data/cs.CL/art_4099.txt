Recurrent One-Hop Predictions for Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs
Large scale knowledge graphs (KGs) such as Freebase are generally incomplete.
Reasoning over multi-hop (mh) KG paths is thus an important capability that is
needed for question answering or other NLP tasks that require knowledge about
the world. mh-KG reasoning includes diverse scenarios, e.g., given a head
entity and a relation path, predict the tail entity; or given two entities
connected by some relation paths, predict the unknown relation between them. We
present ROPs, recurrent one-hop predictors, that predict entities at each step
of mh-KB paths by using recurrent neural networks and vector representations of
entities and relations, with two benefits: (i) modeling mh-paths of arbitrary
lengths while updating the entity and relation representations by the training
signal at each step; (ii) handling different types of mh-KG reasoning in a
unified framework. Our models show state-of-the-art for two important multi-hop
KG reasoning tasks: Knowledge Base Completion and Path Query Answering.
