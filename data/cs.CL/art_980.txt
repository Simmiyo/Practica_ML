Parsing Natural Language Sentences by Semi-supervised Methods
We present our work on semi-supervised parsing of natural language sentences,
focusing on multi-source crosslingual transfer of delexicalized dependency
parsers. We first evaluate the influence of treebank annotation styles on
parsing performance, focusing on adposition attachment style. Then, we present
KLcpos3, an empirical language similarity measure, designed and tuned for
source parser weighting in multi-source delexicalized parser transfer. And
finally, we introduce a novel resource combination method, based on
interpolation of trained parser models.
