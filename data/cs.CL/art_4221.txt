Predicting Concreteness and Imageability of Words Within and Across
  Languages via Word Embeddings
The notions of concreteness and imageability, traditionally important in
psycholinguistics, are gaining significance in semantic-oriented natural
language processing tasks. In this paper we investigate the predictability of
these two concepts via supervised learning, using word embeddings as
explanatory variables. We perform predictions both within and across languages
by exploiting collections of cross-lingual embeddings aligned to a single
vector space. We show that the notions of concreteness and imageability are
highly predictable both within and across languages, with a moderate loss of up
to 20% in correlation when predicting across languages. We further show that
the cross-lingual transfer via word embeddings is more efficient than the
simple transfer via bilingual dictionaries.
