Marking-up multiple views of a Text: Discourse and Reference
We describe an encoding scheme for discourse structure and reference, based
on the TEI Guidelines and the recommendations of the Corpus Encoding
Specification (CES). A central feature of the scheme is a CES-based data
architecture enabling the encoding of and access to multiple views of a
marked-up document. We describe a tool architecture that supports the encoding
scheme, and then show how we have used the encoding scheme and the tools to
perform a discourse analytic task in support of a model of global discourse
cohesion called Veins Theory (Cristea & Ide, 1998).
