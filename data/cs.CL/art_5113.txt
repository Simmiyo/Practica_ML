A Comparative Analysis of Content-based Geolocation in Blogs and Tweets
The geolocation of online information is an essential component in any
geospatial application. While most of the previous work on geolocation has
focused on Twitter, in this paper we quantify and compare the performance of
text-based geolocation methods on social media data drawn from both Blogger and
Twitter. We introduce a novel set of location specific features that are both
highly informative and easily interpretable, and show that we can achieve error
rate reductions of up to 12.5% with respect to the best previously proposed
geolocation features. We also show that despite posting longer text, Blogger
users are significantly harder to geolocate than Twitter users. Additionally,
we investigate the effect of training and testing on different media
(cross-media predictions), or combining multiple social media sources
(multi-media predictions). Finally, we explore the geolocability of social
media in relation to three user dimensions: state, gender, and industry.
