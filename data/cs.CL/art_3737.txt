SIRIUS-LTG-UiO at SemEval-2018 Task 7: Convolutional Neural Networks
  with Shortest Dependency Paths for Semantic Relation Extraction and
  Classification in Scientific Papers
This article presents the SIRIUS-LTG-UiO system for the SemEval 2018 Task 7
on Semantic Relation Extraction and Classification in Scientific Papers. First
we extract the shortest dependency path (sdp) between two entities, then we
introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN) which takes the shortest
dependency path embeddings as input and performs relation classification with
differing objectives for each subtask of the shared task. This approach
achieved overall F1 scores of 76.7 and 83.2 for relation classification on
clean and noisy data, respectively. Furthermore, for combined relation
extraction and classification on clean data, it obtained F1 scores of 37.4 and
33.6 for each phase. Our system ranks 3rd in all three sub-tasks of the shared
task.
