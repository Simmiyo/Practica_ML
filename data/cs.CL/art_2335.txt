A Stylometric Inquiry into Hyperpartisan and Fake News
This paper reports on a writing style analysis of hyperpartisan (i.e.,
extremely one-sided) news in connection to fake news. It presents a large
corpus of 1,627 articles that were manually fact-checked by professional
journalists from BuzzFeed. The articles originated from 9 well-known political
publishers, 3 each from the mainstream, the hyperpartisan left-wing, and the
hyperpartisan right-wing. In sum, the corpus contains 299 fake news, 97% of
which originated from hyperpartisan publishers.
  We propose and demonstrate a new way of assessing style similarity between
text categories via Unmasking---a meta-learning approach originally devised for
authorship verification---, revealing that the style of left-wing and
right-wing news have a lot more in common than any of the two have with the
mainstream. Furthermore, we show that hyperpartisan news can be discriminated
well by its style from the mainstream (F1=0.78), as can be satire from both
(F1=0.81). Unsurprisingly, style-based fake news detection does not live up to
scratch (F1=0.46). Nevertheless, the former results are important to implement
pre-screening for fake news detectors.
