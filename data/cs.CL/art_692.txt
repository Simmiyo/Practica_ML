Towards The Development of a Bishnupriya Manipuri Corpus
For any deep computational processing of language we need evidences, and one
such set of evidences is corpus. This paper describes the development of a
text-based corpus for the Bishnupriya Manipuri language. A Corpus is considered
as a building block for any language processing tasks. Due to the lack of
awareness like other Indian languages, it is also studied less frequently. As a
result the language still lacks a good corpus and basic language processing
tools. As per our knowledge this is the first effort to develop a corpus for
Bishnupriya Manipuri language.
