Learning for Biomedical Information Extraction: Methodological Review of
  Recent Advances
Biomedical information extraction (BioIE) is important to many applications,
including clinical decision support, integrative biology, and
pharmacovigilance, and therefore it has been an active research. Unlike
existing reviews covering a holistic view on BioIE, this review focuses on
mainly recent advances in learning based approaches, by systematically
summarizing them into different aspects of methodological development. In
addition, we dive into open information extraction and deep learning, two
emerging and influential techniques and envision next generation of BioIE.
