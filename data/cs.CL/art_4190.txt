Lost in Translation: Analysis of Information Loss During Machine
  Translation Between Polysynthetic and Fusional Languages
Machine translation from polysynthetic to fusional languages is a challenging
task, which gets further complicated by the limited amount of parallel text
available. Thus, translation performance is far from the state of the art for
high-resource and more intensively studied language pairs. To shed light on the
phenomena which hamper automatic translation to and from polysynthetic
languages, we study translations from three low-resource, polysynthetic
languages (Nahuatl, Wixarika and Yorem Nokki) into Spanish and vice versa.
Doing so, we find that in a morpheme-to-morpheme alignment an important amount
of information contained in polysynthetic morphemes has no Spanish counterpart,
and its translation is often omitted. We further conduct a qualitative analysis
and, thus, identify morpheme types that are commonly hard to align or ignored
in the translation process.
