Improve the Evaluation of Fluency Using Entropy for Machine Translation
  Evaluation Metrics
The widely-used automatic evaluation metrics cannot adequately reflect the
fluency of the translations. The n-gram-based metrics, like BLEU, limit the
maximum length of matched fragments to n and cannot catch the matched fragments
longer than n, so they can only reflect the fluency indirectly. METEOR, which
is not limited by n-gram, uses the number of matched chunks but it does not
consider the length of each chunk. In this paper, we propose an entropy-based
method, which can sufficiently reflect the fluency of translations through the
distribution of matched words. This method can easily combine with the
widely-used automatic evaluation metrics to improve the evaluation of fluency.
Experiments show that the correlations of BLEU and METEOR are improved on
sentence level after combining with the entropy-based method on WMT 2010 and
WMT 2012.
