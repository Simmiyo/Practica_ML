Bias in Semantic and Discourse Interpretation
In this paper, we show how game-theoretic work on conversation combined with
a theory of discourse structure provides a framework for studying interpretive
bias. Interpretive bias is an essential feature of learning and understanding
but also something that can be used to pervert or subvert the truth. The
framework we develop here provides tools for understanding and analyzing the
range of interpretive biases and the factors that contribute to them.
