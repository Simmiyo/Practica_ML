Corpus Annotation for Parser Evaluation
We describe a recently developed corpus annotation scheme for evaluating
parsers that avoids shortcomings of current methods. The scheme encodes
grammatical relations between heads and dependents, and has been used to mark
up a new public-domain corpus of naturally occurring English text. We show how
the corpus can be used to evaluate the accuracy of a robust parser, and relate
the corpus to extant resources.
