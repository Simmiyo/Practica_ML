Syntactic Structures and Code Parameters
We assign binary and ternary error-correcting codes to the data of syntactic
structures of world languages and we study the distribution of code points in
the space of code parameters. We show that, while most codes populate the lower
region approximating a superposition of Thomae functions, there is a
substantial presence of codes above the Gilbert-Varshamov bound and even above
the asymptotic bound and the Plotkin bound. We investigate the dynamics induced
on the space of code parameters by spin glass models of language change, and
show that, in the presence of entailment relations between syntactic parameters
the dynamics can sometimes improve the code. For large sets of languages and
syntactic data, one can gain information on the spin glass dynamics from the
induced dynamics in the space of code parameters.
