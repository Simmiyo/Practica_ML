Generating Memorable Mnemonic Encodings of Numbers
The major system is a mnemonic system that can be used to memorize sequences
of numbers. In this work, we present a method to automatically generate
sentences that encode a given number. We propose several encoding models and
compare the most promising ones in a password memorability study. The results
of the study show that a model combining part-of-speech sentence templates with
an $n$-gram language model produces the most memorable password
representations.
