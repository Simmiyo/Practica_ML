NMTPY: A Flexible Toolkit for Advanced Neural Machine Translation
  Systems
In this paper, we present nmtpy, a flexible Python toolkit based on Theano
for training Neural Machine Translation and other neural sequence-to-sequence
architectures. nmtpy decouples the specification of a network from the training
and inference utilities to simplify the addition of a new architecture and
reduce the amount of boilerplate code to be written. nmtpy has been used for
LIUM's top-ranked submissions to WMT Multimodal Machine Translation and News
Translation tasks in 2016 and 2017.
