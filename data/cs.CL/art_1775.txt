Speaker Cluster-Based Speaker Adaptive Training for Deep Neural Network
  Acoustic Modeling
A speaker cluster-based speaker adaptive training (SAT) method under deep
neural network-hidden Markov model (DNN-HMM) framework is presented in this
paper. During training, speakers that are acoustically adjacent to each other
are hierarchically clustered using an i-vector based distance metric. DNNs with
speaker dependent layers are then adaptively trained for each cluster of
speakers. Before decoding starts, an unseen speaker in test set is matched to
the closest speaker cluster through comparing i-vector based distances. The
previously trained DNN of the matched speaker cluster is used for decoding
utterances of the test speaker. The performance of the proposed method on a
large vocabulary spontaneous speech recognition task is evaluated on a training
set of with 1500 hours of speech, and a test set of 24 speakers with 1774
utterances. Comparing to a speaker independent DNN with a baseline word error
rate of 11.6%, a relative 6.8% reduction in word error rate is observed from
the proposed method.
