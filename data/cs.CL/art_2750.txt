Deep Active Learning for Named Entity Recognition
Deep learning has yielded state-of-the-art performance on many natural
language processing tasks including named entity recognition (NER). However,
this typically requires large amounts of labeled data. In this work, we
demonstrate that the amount of labeled training data can be drastically reduced
when deep learning is combined with active learning. While active learning is
sample-efficient, it can be computationally expensive since it requires
iterative retraining. To speed this up, we introduce a lightweight architecture
for NER, viz., the CNN-CNN-LSTM model consisting of convolutional character and
word encoders and a long short term memory (LSTM) tag decoder. The model
achieves nearly state-of-the-art performance on standard datasets for the task
while being computationally much more efficient than best performing models. We
carry out incremental active learning, during the training process, and are
able to nearly match state-of-the-art performance with just 25\% of the
original training data.
