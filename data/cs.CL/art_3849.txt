Huge Automatically Extracted Training Sets for Multilingual Word Sense
  Disambiguation
We release to the community six large-scale sense-annotated datasets in
multiple language to pave the way for supervised multilingual Word Sense
Disambiguation. Our datasets cover all the nouns in the English WordNet and
their translations in other languages for a total of millions of sense-tagged
sentences. Experiments prove that these corpora can be effectively used as
training sets for supervised WSD systems, surpassing the state of the art for
low-resourced languages and providing competitive results for English, where
manually annotated training sets are accessible. The data is available at
trainomatic.org.
