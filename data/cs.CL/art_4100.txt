Learning to Automatically Generate Fill-In-The-Blank Quizzes
In this paper we formalize the problem automatic fill-in-the-blank question
generation using two standard NLP machine learning schemes, proposing concrete
deep learning models for each. We present an empirical study based on data
obtained from a language learning platform showing that both of our proposed
settings offer promising results.
