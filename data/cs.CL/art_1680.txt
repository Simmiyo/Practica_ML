Hyponymy extraction of domain ontology concept based on ccrfs and
  hierarchy clustering
Concept hierarchy is the backbone of ontology, and the concept hierarchy
acquisition has been a hot topic in the field of ontology learning. this paper
proposes a hyponymy extraction method of domain ontology concept based on
cascaded conditional random field(CCRFs) and hierarchy clustering. It takes
free text as extracting object, adopts CCRFs identifying the domain concepts.
First the low layer of CCRFs is used to identify simple domain concept, then
the results are sent to the high layer, in which the nesting concepts are
recognized. Next we adopt hierarchy clustering to identify the hyponymy
relation between domain ontology concepts. The experimental results demonstrate
the proposed method is efficient.
