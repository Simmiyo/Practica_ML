Phrase Pair Mappings for Hindi-English Statistical Machine Translation
In this paper, we present our work on the creation of lexical resources for
the Machine Translation between English and Hindi. We describes the development
of phrase pair mappings for our experiments and the comparative performance
evaluation between different trained models on top of the baseline Statistical
Machine Translation system. We focused on augmenting the parallel corpus with
more vocabulary as well as with various inflected forms by exploring different
ways. We have augmented the training corpus with various lexical resources such
as lexical words, synset words, function words and verb phrases. We have
described the case studies, automatic and subjective evaluations, detailed
error analysis for both the English to Hindi and Hindi to English machine
translation systems. We further analyzed that, there is an incremental growth
in the quality of machine translation with the usage of various lexical
resources. Thus lexical resources do help uplift the translation quality of
resource poor langugaes.
