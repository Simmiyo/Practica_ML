VoxML: A Visualization Modeling Language
We present the specification for a modeling language, VoxML, which encodes
semantic knowledge of real-world objects represented as three-dimensional
models, and of events and attributes related to and enacted over these objects.
VoxML is intended to overcome the limitations of existing 3D visual markup
languages by allowing for the encoding of a broad range of semantic knowledge
that can be exploited by a variety of systems and platforms, leading to
multimodal simulations of real-world scenarios using conceptual objects that
represent their semantic values.
