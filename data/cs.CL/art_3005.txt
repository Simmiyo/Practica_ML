Linguistic Features of Genre and Method Variation in Translation: A
  Computational Perspective
In this paper we describe the use of text classification methods to
investigate genre and method variation in an English - German translation
corpus. For this purpose we use linguistically motivated features representing
texts using a combination of part-of-speech tags arranged in bigrams, trigrams,
and 4-grams. The classification method used in this paper is a Bayesian
classifier with Laplace smoothing. We use the output of the classifiers to
carry out an extensive feature analysis on the main difference between genres
and methods of translation.
