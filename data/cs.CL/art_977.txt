A Publicly Available Cross-Platform Lemmatizer for Bulgarian
Our dictionary-based lemmatizer for the Bulgarian language presented here is
distributed as free software, publicly available to download and use under the
GPL v3 license. The presented software is written entirely in Java and is
distributed as a GATE plugin. To our best knowledge, at the time of writing
this article, there are not any other free lemmatization tools specifically
targeting the Bulgarian language. The presented lemmatizer is a work in
progress and currently yields an accuracy of about 95% in comparison to the
manually annotated corpus BulTreeBank-Morph, which contains 273933 tokens.
