Automated assessment of non-native learner essays: Investigating the
  role of linguistic features
Automatic essay scoring (AES) refers to the process of scoring free text
responses to given prompts, considering human grader scores as the gold
standard. Writing such essays is an essential component of many language and
aptitude exams. Hence, AES became an active and established area of research,
and there are many proprietary systems used in real life applications today.
However, not much is known about which specific linguistic features are useful
for prediction and how much of this is consistent across datasets. This article
addresses that by exploring the role of various linguistic features in
automatic essay scoring using two publicly available datasets of non-native
English essays written in test taking scenarios. The linguistic properties are
modeled by encoding lexical, syntactic, discourse and error types of learner
language in the feature set. Predictive models are then developed using these
features on both datasets and the most predictive features are compared. While
the results show that the feature set used results in good predictive models
with both datasets, the question "what are the most predictive features?" has a
different answer for each dataset.
