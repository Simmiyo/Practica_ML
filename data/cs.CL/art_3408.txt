Fluency Over Adequacy: A Pilot Study in Measuring User Trust in
  Imperfect MT
Although measuring intrinsic quality has been a key factor in the advancement
of Machine Translation (MT), successfully deploying MT requires considering not
just intrinsic quality but also the user experience, including aspects such as
trust. This work introduces a method of studying how users modulate their trust
in an MT system after seeing errorful (disfluent or inadequate) output amidst
good (fluent and adequate) output. We conduct a survey to determine how users
respond to good translations compared to translations that are either adequate
but not fluent, or fluent but not adequate. In this pilot study, users
responded strongly to disfluent translations, but were, surprisingly, much less
concerned with adequacy.
