How Easy is it to Learn a Controlled Natural Language for Building a
  Knowledge Base?
Recent developments in controlled natural language editors for knowledge
engineering (KE) have given rise to expectations that they will make KE tasks
more accessible and perhaps even enable non-engineers to build knowledge bases.
This exploratory research focussed on novices and experts in knowledge
engineering during their attempts to learn a controlled natural language (CNL)
known as OWL Simplified English and use it to build a small knowledge base.
Participants' behaviours during the task were observed through eye-tracking and
screen recordings. This was an attempt at a more ambitious user study than in
previous research because we used a naturally occurring text as the source of
domain knowledge, and left them without guidance on which information to
select, or how to encode it. We have identified a number of skills
(competencies) required for this difficult task and key problems that authors
face.
