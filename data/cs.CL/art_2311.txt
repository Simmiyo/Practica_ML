UsingWord Embedding for Cross-Language Plagiarism Detection
This paper proposes to use distributed representation of words (word
embeddings) in cross-language textual similarity detection. The main
contributions of this paper are the following: (a) we introduce new
cross-language similarity detection methods based on distributed representation
of words; (b) we combine the different methods proposed to verify their
complementarity and finally obtain an overall F1 score of 89.15% for
English-French similarity detection at chunk level (88.5% at sentence level) on
a very challenging corpus.
