TAP-DLND 1.0 : A Corpus for Document Level Novelty Detection
Detecting novelty of an entire document is an Artificial Intelligence (AI)
frontier problem that has widespread NLP applications, such as extractive
document summarization, tracking development of news events, predicting impact
of scholarly articles, etc. Important though the problem is, we are unaware of
any benchmark document level data that correctly addresses the evaluation of
automatic novelty detection techniques in a classification framework. To bridge
this gap, we present here a resource for benchmarking the techniques for
document level novelty detection. We create the resource via event-specific
crawling of news documents across several domains in a periodic manner. We
release the annotated corpus with necessary statistics and show its use with a
developed system for the problem in concern.
