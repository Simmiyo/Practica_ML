A Statistical Comparison of Some Theories of NP Word Order
A frequent object of study in linguistic typology is the order of elements
{demonstrative, adjective, numeral, noun} in the noun phrase. The goal is to
predict the relative frequencies of these orders across languages. Here we use
Poisson regression to statistically compare some prominent accounts of this
variation. We compare feature systems derived from Cinque (2005) to feature
systems given in Cysouw (2010) and Dryer (in prep). In this setting, we do not
find clear reasons to prefer the model of Cinque (2005) or Dryer (in prep), but
we find both of these models have substantially better fit to the typological
data than the model from Cysouw (2010).
