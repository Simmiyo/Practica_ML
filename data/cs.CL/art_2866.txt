Towards Neural Speaker Modeling in Multi-Party Conversation: The Task,
  Dataset, and Models
Neural network-based dialog systems are attracting increasing attention in
both academia and industry. Recently, researchers have begun to realize the
importance of speaker modeling in neural dialog systems, but there lacks
established tasks and datasets. In this paper, we propose speaker
classification as a surrogate task for general speaker modeling, and collect
massive data to facilitate research in this direction. We further investigate
temporal-based and content-based models of speakers, and propose several
hybrids of them. Experiments show that speaker classification is feasible, and
that hybrid models outperform each single component.
