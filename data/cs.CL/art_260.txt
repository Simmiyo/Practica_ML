Language Access: An Information Based Approach
The anusaaraka system (a kind of machine translation system) makes text in
one Indian language accessible through another Indian language. The machine
presents an image of the source text in a language close to the target
language. In the image, some constructions of the source language (which do not
have equivalents in the target language) spill over to the output. Some special
notation is also devised.
  Anusaarakas have been built from five pairs of languages: Telugu,Kannada,
Marathi, Bengali and Punjabi to Hindi. They are available for use through Email
servers.
  Anusaarkas follows the principle of substitutibility and reversibility of
strings produced. This implies preservation of information while going from a
source language to a target language.
  For narrow subject areas, specialized modules can be built by putting subject
domain knowledge into the system, which produce good quality grammatical
output. However, it should be remembered, that such modules will work only in
narrow areas, and will sometimes go wrong. In such a situation, anusaaraka
output will still remain useful.
