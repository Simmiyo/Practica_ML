Latent Human Traits in the Language of Social Media: An Open-Vocabulary
  Approach
Over the past century, personality theory and research has successfully
identified core sets of characteristics that consistently describe and explain
fundamental differences in the way people think, feel and behave. Such
characteristics were derived through theory, dictionary analyses, and survey
research using explicit self-reports. The availability of social media data
spanning millions of users now makes it possible to automatically derive
characteristics from language use -- at large scale. Taking advantage of
linguistic information available through Facebook, we study the process of
inferring a new set of potential human traits based on unprompted language use.
We subject these new traits to a comprehensive set of evaluations and compare
them with a popular five factor model of personality. We find that our
language-based trait construct is often more generalizable in that it often
predicts non-questionnaire-based outcomes better than questionnaire-based
traits (e.g. entities someone likes, income and intelligence quotient), while
the factors remain nearly as stable as traditional factors. Our approach
suggests a value in new constructs of personality derived from everyday human
language use.
