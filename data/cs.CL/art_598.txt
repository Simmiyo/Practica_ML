Towards the Fully Automatic Merging of Lexical Resources: A Step Forward
This article reports on the results of the research done towards the fully
automatically merging of lexical resources. Our main goal is to show the
generality of the proposed approach, which have been previously applied to
merge Spanish Subcategorization Frames lexica. In this work we extend and apply
the same technique to perform the merging of morphosyntactic lexica encoded in
LMF. The experiments showed that the technique is general enough to obtain good
results in these two different tasks which is an important step towards
performing the merging of lexical resources fully automatically.
