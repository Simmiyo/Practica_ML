Towards a Semantic-based Approach for Modeling Regulatory Documents in
  Building Industry
Regulations in the Building Industry are becoming increasingly complex and
involve more than one technical area. They cover products, components and
project implementation. They also play an important role to ensure the quality
of a building, and to minimize its environmental impact. In this paper, we are
particularly interested in the modeling of the regulatory constraints derived
from the Technical Guides issued by CSTB and used to validate Technical
Assessments. We first describe our approach for modeling regulatory constraints
in the SBVR language, and formalizing them in the SPARQL language. Second, we
describe how we model the processes of compliance checking described in the
CSTB Technical Guides. Third, we show how we implement these processes to
assist industrials in drafting Technical Documents in order to acquire a
Technical Assessment; a compliance report is automatically generated to explain
the compliance or noncompliance of this Technical Documents.
