Applying Machine Translation to Two-Stage Cross-Language Information
  Retrieval
Cross-language information retrieval (CLIR), where queries and documents are
in different languages, needs a translation of queries and/or documents, so as
to standardize both of them into a common representation. For this purpose, the
use of machine translation is an effective approach. However, computational
cost is prohibitive in translating large-scale document collections. To resolve
this problem, we propose a two-stage CLIR method. First, we translate a given
query into the document language, and retrieve a limited number of foreign
documents. Second, we machine translate only those documents into the user
language, and re-rank them based on the translation result. We also show the
effectiveness of our method by way of experiments using Japanese queries and
English technical documents.
