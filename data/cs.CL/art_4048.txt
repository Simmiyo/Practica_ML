The Limitations of Cross-language Word Embeddings Evaluation
The aim of this work is to explore the possible limitations of existing
methods of cross-language word embeddings evaluation, addressing the lack of
correlation between intrinsic and extrinsic cross-language evaluation methods.
To prove this hypothesis, we construct English-Russian datasets for extrinsic
and intrinsic evaluation tasks and compare performances of 5 different
cross-language models on them. The results say that the scores even on
different intrinsic benchmarks do not correlate to each other. We can conclude
that the use of human references as ground truth for cross-language word
embeddings is not proper unless one does not understand how do native speakers
process semantics in their cognition.
