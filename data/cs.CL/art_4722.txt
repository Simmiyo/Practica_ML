Analysis of Risk Factor Domains in Psychosis Patient Health Records
Readmission after discharge from a hospital is disruptive and costly,
regardless of the reason. However, it can be particularly problematic for
psychiatric patients, so predicting which patients may be readmitted is
critically important but also very difficult. Clinical narratives in
psychiatric electronic health records (EHRs) span a wide range of topics and
vocabulary; therefore, a psychiatric readmission prediction model must begin
with a robust and interpretable topic extraction component. We created a data
pipeline for using document vector similarity metrics to perform topic
extraction on psychiatric EHR data in service of our long-term goal of creating
a readmission risk classifier. We show initial results for our topic extraction
model and identify additional features we will be incorporating in the future.
