An Enhanced Latent Semantic Analysis Approach for Arabic Document
  Summarization
The fast-growing amount of information on the Internet makes the research in
automatic document summarization very urgent. It is an effective solution for
information overload. Many approaches have been proposed based on different
strategies, such as latent semantic analysis (LSA). However, LSA, when applied
to document summarization, has some limitations which diminish its performance.
In this work, we try to overcome these limitations by applying statistic and
linear algebraic approaches combined with syntactic and semantic processing of
text. First, the part of speech tagger is utilized to reduce the dimension of
LSA. Then, the weight of the term in four adjacent sentences is added to the
weighting schemes while calculating the input matrix to take into account the
word order and the syntactic relations. In addition, a new LSA-based sentence
selection algorithm is proposed, in which the term description is combined with
sentence description for each topic which in turn makes the generated summary
more informative and diverse. To ensure the effectiveness of the proposed
LSA-based sentence selection algorithm, extensive experiment on Arabic and
English are done. Four datasets are used to evaluate the new model, Linguistic
Data Consortium (LDC) Arabic Newswire-a corpus, Essex Arabic Summaries Corpus
(EASC), DUC2002, and Multilingual MSS 2015 dataset. Experimental results on the
four datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed model on Arabic and
English datasets. It performs comprehensively better compared to the
state-of-the-art methods.
