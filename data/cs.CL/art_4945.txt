Multi-label Multi-task Deep Learning for Behavioral Coding
We propose a methodology for estimating human behaviors in psychotherapy
sessions using mutli-label and multi-task learning paradigms. We discuss the
problem of behavioral coding in which data of human interactions is the
annotated with labels to describe relevant human behaviors of interest. We
describe two related, yet distinct, corpora consisting of therapist client
interactions in psychotherapy sessions. We experimentally compare the proposed
learning approaches for estimating behaviors of interest in these datasets.
Specifically, we compare single and multiple label learning approaches, single
and multiple task learning approaches, and evaluate the performance of these
approaches when incorporating turn context. We demonstrate the prediction
performance gains which can be achieved by using the proposed paradigms and
discuss the insights these models provide into these complex interactions.
