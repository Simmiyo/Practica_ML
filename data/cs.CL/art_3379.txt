Natural Language Inference over Interaction Space: ICLR 2018
  Reproducibility Report
We have tried to reproduce the results of the paper "Natural Language
Inference over Interaction Space" submitted to ICLR 2018 conference as part of
the ICLR 2018 Reproducibility Challenge. Initially, we were not aware that the
code was available, so we started to implement the network from scratch. We
have evaluated our version of the model on Stanford NLI dataset and reached
86.38% accuracy on the test set, while the paper claims 88.0% accuracy. The
main difference, as we understand it, comes from the optimizers and the way
model selection is performed.
