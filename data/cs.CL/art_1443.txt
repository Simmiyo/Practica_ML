Candidate sentence selection for language learning exercises: from a
  comprehensive framework to an empirical evaluation
We present a framework and its implementation relying on Natural Language
Processing methods, which aims at the identification of exercise item
candidates from corpora. The hybrid system combining heuristics and machine
learning methods includes a number of relevant selection criteria. We focus on
two fundamental aspects: linguistic complexity and the dependence of the
extracted sentences on their original context. Previous work on exercise
generation addressed these two criteria only to a limited extent, and a refined
overall candidate sentence selection framework appears also to be lacking. In
addition to a detailed description of the system, we present the results of an
empirical evaluation conducted with language teachers and learners which
indicate the usefulness of the system for educational purposes. We have
integrated our system into a freely available online learning platform.
