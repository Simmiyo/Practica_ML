Developing a New Approach for Arabic Morphological Analysis and
  Generation
Arabic morphological analysis is one of the essential stages in Arabic
Natural Language Processing. In this paper we present an approach for Arabic
morphological analysis. This approach is based on Arabic morphological
automaton (AMAUT). The proposed technique uses a morphological database
realized using XMODEL language. Arabic morphology represents a special type of
morphological systems because it is based on the concept of scheme to represent
Arabic words. We use this concept to develop the Arabic morphological automata.
The proposed approach has development standardization aspect. It can be
exploited by NLP applications such as syntactic and semantic analysis,
information retrieval, machine translation and orthographical correction. The
proposed approach is compared with Xerox Arabic Analyzer and Smrz Arabic
Analyzer.
