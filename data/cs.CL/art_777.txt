Toward verbalizing ontologies in isiZulu
IsiZulu is one of the eleven official languages of South Africa and roughly
half the population can speak it. It is the first (home) language for over 10
million people in South Africa. Only a few computational resources exist for
isiZulu and its related Nguni languages, yet the imperative for tool
development exists. We focus on natural language generation, and the grammar
options and preferences in particular, which will inform verbalization of
knowledge representation languages and could contribute to machine translation.
The verbalization pattern specification shows that the grammar rules are
elaborate and there are several options of which one may have preference. We
devised verbalization patterns for subsumption, basic disjointness, existential
and universal quantification, and conjunction. This was evaluated in a survey
among linguists and non-linguists. Some differences between linguists and
non-linguists can be observed, with the former much more in agreement, and
preferences depend on the overall structure of the sentence, such as singular
for subsumption and plural in other cases.
