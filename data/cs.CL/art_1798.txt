A corpus of preposition supersenses in English web reviews
We present the first corpus annotated with preposition supersenses,
unlexicalized categories for semantic functions that can be marked by English
prepositions (Schneider et al., 2015). That scheme improves upon its
predecessors to better facilitate comprehensive manual annotation. Moreover,
unlike the previous schemes, the preposition supersenses are organized
hierarchically. Our data will be publicly released on the web upon publication.
