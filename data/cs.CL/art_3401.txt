Tools and resources for Romanian text-to-speech and speech-to-text
  applications
In this paper we introduce a set of resources and tools aimed at providing
support for natural language processing, text-to-speech synthesis and speech
recognition for Romanian. While the tools are general purpose and can be used
for any language (we successfully trained our system for more than 50 languages
and participated in the Universal Dependencies Shared Task), the resources are
only relevant for Romanian language processing.
