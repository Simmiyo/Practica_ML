Automatic Identification of Arabic expressions related to future events
  in Lebanon's economy
In this paper, we propose a method to automatically identify future events in
Lebanon's economy from Arabic texts. Challenges are threefold: first, we need
to build a corpus of Arabic texts that covers Lebanon's economy; second, we
need to study how future events are expressed linguistically in these texts;
and third, we need to automatically identify the relevant textual segments
accordingly. We will validate this method on a constructed corpus form the web
and show that it has very promising results. To do so, we will be using SLCSAS,
a system for semantic analysis, based on the Contextual Explorer method, and
"AlKhalil Morpho Sys" system for morpho-syntactic analysis.
