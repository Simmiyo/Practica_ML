Towards speech-to-text translation without speech recognition
We explore the problem of translating speech to text in low-resource
scenarios where neither automatic speech recognition (ASR) nor machine
translation (MT) are available, but we have training data in the form of audio
paired with text translations. We present the first system for this problem
applied to a realistic multi-speaker dataset, the CALLHOME Spanish-English
speech translation corpus. Our approach uses unsupervised term discovery (UTD)
to cluster repeated patterns in the audio, creating a pseudotext, which we pair
with translations to create a parallel text and train a simple bag-of-words MT
model. We identify the challenges faced by the system, finding that the
difficulty of cross-speaker UTD results in low recall, but that our system is
still able to correctly translate some content words in test data.
