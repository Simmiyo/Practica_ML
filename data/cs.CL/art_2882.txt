Towards Speech Emotion Recognition "in the wild" using Aggregated
  Corpora and Deep Multi-Task Learning
One of the challenges in Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) "in the wild" is
the large mismatch between training and test data (e.g. speakers and tasks). In
order to improve the generalisation capabilities of the emotion models, we
propose to use Multi-Task Learning (MTL) and use gender and naturalness as
auxiliary tasks in deep neural networks. This method was evaluated in
within-corpus and various cross-corpus classification experiments that simulate
conditions "in the wild". In comparison to Single-Task Learning (STL) based
state of the art methods, we found that our MTL method proposed improved
performance significantly. Particularly, models using both gender and
naturalness achieved more gains than those using either gender or naturalness
separately. This benefit was also found in the high-level representations of
the feature space, obtained from our method proposed, where discriminative
emotional clusters could be observed.
