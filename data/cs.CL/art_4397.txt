Emoji Sentiment Scores of Writers using Odds Ratio and Fisher Exact Test
The sentiment of a given emoji is traditionally calculated by averaging the
ratings {-1, 0 or +1} given by various users to a given context where the emoji
appears. However, using such formula complicates the statistical significance
analysis particularly for low sample sizes. Here, we provide sentiment scores
using odds and a sentiment mapping to a 4-icon scale. We show how odds ratio
statistics leads to simpler sentiment analysis. Finally, we provide a list of
sentiment scores with the often-missing exact p-values and CI for the most
common emoji.
