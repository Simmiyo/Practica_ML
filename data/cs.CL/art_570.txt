Classification Analysis Of Authorship Fiction Texts in The Space Of
  Semantic Fields
The use of naive Bayesian classifier (NB) and the classifier by the k nearest
neighbors (kNN) in classification semantic analysis of authors' texts of
English fiction has been analysed. The authors' works are considered in the
vector space the basis of which is formed by the frequency characteristics of
semantic fields of nouns and verbs. Highly precise classification of authors'
texts in the vector space of semantic fields indicates about the presence of
particular spheres of author's idiolect in this space which characterizes the
individual author's style.
