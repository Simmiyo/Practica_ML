German in Flux: Detecting Metaphoric Change via Word Entropy
This paper explores the information-theoretic measure entropy to detect
metaphoric change, transferring ideas from hypernym detection to research on
language change. We also build the first diachronic test set for German as a
standard for metaphoric change annotation. Our model shows high performance, is
unsupervised, language-independent and generalizable to other processes of
semantic change.
