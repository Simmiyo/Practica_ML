English-Japanese Neural Machine Translation with
  Encoder-Decoder-Reconstructor
Neural machine translation (NMT) has recently become popular in the field of
machine translation. However, NMT suffers from the problem of repeating or
missing words in the translation. To address this problem, Tu et al. (2017)
proposed an encoder-decoder-reconstructor framework for NMT using
back-translation. In this method, they selected the best forward translation
model in the same manner as Bahdanau et al. (2015), and then trained a
bi-directional translation model as fine-tuning. Their experiments show that it
offers significant improvement in BLEU scores in Chinese-English translation
task. We confirm that our re-implementation also shows the same tendency and
alleviates the problem of repeating and missing words in the translation on a
English-Japanese task too. In addition, we evaluate the effectiveness of
pre-training by comparing it with a jointly-trained model of forward
translation and back-translation.
