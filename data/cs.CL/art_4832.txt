Towards Verifying Semantic Roles Co-occurrence
Semantic role theory considers roles as a small universal set of unanalyzed
entities. It means that formally there are no restrictions on role
combinations. We argue that the semantic roles co-occur in verb
representations. It means that there are hidden restrictions on role
combinations. To demonstrate that a practical and evidence-based approach has
been built on in-depth analysis of the largest verb database VerbNet. The
consequences of this approach are considered.
