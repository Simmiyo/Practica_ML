An investigation into language complexity of World-of-Warcraft
  game-external texts
We present a language complexity analysis of World of Warcraft (WoW)
community texts, which we compare to texts from a general corpus of web
English. Results from several complexity types are presented, including lexical
diversity, density, readability and syntactic complexity. The language of WoW
texts is found to be comparable to the general corpus on some complexity
measures, yet more specialized on other measures. Our findings can be used by
educators willing to include game-related activities into school curricula.
