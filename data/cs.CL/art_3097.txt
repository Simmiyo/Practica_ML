Towards an Inferential Lexicon of Event Selecting Predicates for French
We present a manually constructed seed lexicon encoding the inferential
profiles of French event selecting predicates across different uses. The
inferential profile (Karttunen, 1971a) of a verb is designed to capture the
inferences triggered by the use of this verb in context. It reflects the
influence of the clause-embedding verb on the factuality of the event described
by the embedded clause. The resource developed provides evidence for the
following three hypotheses: (i) French implicative verbs have an aspect
dependent profile (their inferential profile varies with outer aspect), while
factive verbs have an aspect independent profile (they keep the same
inferential profile with both imperfective and perfective aspect); (ii)
implicativity decreases with imperfective aspect: the inferences triggered by
French implicative verbs combined with perfective aspect are often weakened
when the same verbs are combined with imperfective aspect; (iii) implicativity
decreases with an animate (deep) subject: the inferences triggered by a verb
which is implicative with an inanimate subject are weakened when the same verb
is used with an animate subject. The resource additionally shows that verbs
with different inferential profiles display clearly distinct sub-categorisation
patterns. In particular, verbs that have both factive and implicative readings
are shown to prefer infinitival clauses in their implicative reading, and
tensed clauses in their factive reading.
