An Ontology-Based Dialogue Management System for Banking and Finance
  Dialogue Systems
Keeping the dialogue state in dialogue systems is a notoriously difficult
task. We introduce an ontology-based dialogue manage(OntoDM), a dialogue
manager that keeps the state of the conversation, provides a basis for anaphora
resolution and drives the conversation via domain ontologies. The banking and
finance area promises great potential for disambiguating the context via a rich
set of products and specificity of proper nouns, named entities and verbs. We
used ontologies both as a knowledge base and a basis for the dialogue manager;
the knowledge base component and dialogue manager components coalesce in a
sense. Domain knowledge is used to track Entities of Interest, i.e. nodes
(classes) of the ontology which happen to be products and services. In this way
we also introduced conversation memory and attention in a sense. We finely
blended linguistic methods, domain-driven keyword ranking and domain ontologies
to create ways of domain-driven conversation. Proposed framework is used in our
in-house German language banking and finance chatbots. General challenges of
German language processing and finance-banking domain chatbot language models
and lexicons are also introduced. This work is still in progress, hence no
success metrics have been introduced yet.
