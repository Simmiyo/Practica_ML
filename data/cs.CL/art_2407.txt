Joint Learning of Correlated Sequence Labelling Tasks Using
  Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks
The stream of words produced by Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems is
typically devoid of punctuations and formatting. Most natural language
processing applications expect segmented and well-formatted texts as input,
which is not available in ASR output. This paper proposes a novel technique of
jointly modeling multiple correlated tasks such as punctuation and
capitalization using bidirectional recurrent neural networks, which leads to
improved performance for each of these tasks. This method could be extended for
joint modeling of any other correlated sequence labeling tasks.
