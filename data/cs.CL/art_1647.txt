Extracting Family Relationship Networks from Novels
We present an approach to the extraction of family relations from literary
narrative, which incorporates a technique for utterance attribution proposed
recently by Elson and McKeown (2010). In our work this technique is used in
combination with the detection of vocatives - the explicit forms of address
used by the characters in a novel. We take advantage of the fact that certain
vocatives indicate family relations between speakers. The extracted relations
are then propagated using a set of rules. We report the results of the
application of our method to Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.
