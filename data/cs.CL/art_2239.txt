Cross-lingual RST Discourse Parsing
Discourse parsing is an integral part of understanding information flow and
argumentative structure in documents. Most previous research has focused on
inducing and evaluating models from the English RST Discourse Treebank.
However, discourse treebanks for other languages exist, including Spanish,
German, Basque, Dutch and Brazilian Portuguese. The treebanks share the same
underlying linguistic theory, but differ slightly in the way documents are
annotated. In this paper, we present (a) a new discourse parser which is
simpler, yet competitive (significantly better on 2/3 metrics) to state of the
art for English, (b) a harmonization of discourse treebanks across languages,
enabling us to present (c) what to the best of our knowledge are the first
experiments on cross-lingual discourse parsing.
