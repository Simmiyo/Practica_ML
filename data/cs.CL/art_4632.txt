Stance Prediction for Russian: Data and Analysis
Stance detection is a critical component of rumour and fake news
identification. It involves the extraction of the stance a particular author
takes related to a given claim, both expressed in text. This paper investigates
stance classification for Russian. It introduces a new dataset, RuStance, of
Russian tweets and news comments from multiple sources, covering multiple
stories, as well as text classification approaches to stance detection as
benchmarks over this data in this language. As well as presenting this
openly-available dataset, the first of its kind for Russian, the paper presents
a baseline for stance prediction in the language.
