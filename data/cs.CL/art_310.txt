Scaling Construction Grammar up to Production Systems: the SCIM
While a great effort has concerned the development of fully integrated
modular understanding systems, few researches have focused on the problem of
unifying existing linguistic formalisms with cognitive processing models. The
Situated Constructional Interpretation Model is one of these attempts. In this
model, the notion of "construction" has been adapted in order to be able to
mimic the behavior of Production Systems. The Construction Grammar approach
establishes a model of the relations between linguistic forms and meaning, by
the mean of constructions. The latter can be considered as pairings from a
topologically structured space to an unstructured space, in some way a special
kind of production rules.
