A Hybrid Approach to Word Sense Disambiguation Combining Supervised and
  Unsupervised Learning
In this paper, we are going to find meaning of words based on distinct
situations. Word Sense Disambiguation is used to find meaning of words based on
live contexts using supervised and unsupervised approaches. Unsupervised
approaches use online dictionary for learning, and supervised approaches use
manual learning sets. Hand tagged data are populated which might not be
effective and sufficient for learning procedure. This limitation of information
is main flaw of the supervised approach. Our proposed approach focuses to
overcome the limitation using learning set which is enriched in dynamic way
maintaining new data. Trivial filtering method is utilized to achieve
appropriate training data. We introduce a mixed methodology having Modified
Lesk approach and Bag-of-Words having enriched bags using learning methods. Our
approach establishes the superiority over individual Modified Lesk and
Bag-of-Words approaches based on experimentation.
