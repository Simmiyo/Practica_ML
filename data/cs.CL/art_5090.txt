Corpus Phonetics Tutorial
Corpus phonetics has become an increasingly popular method of research in
linguistic analysis. With advances in speech technology and computational
power, large scale processing of speech data has become a viable technique.
This tutorial introduces the speech scientist and engineer to various automatic
speech processing tools. These include acoustic model creation and forced
alignment using the Kaldi Automatic Speech Recognition Toolkit (Povey et al.,
2011), forced alignment using FAVE-align (Rosenfelder et al., 2014), the
Montreal Forced Aligner (McAuliffe et al., 2017), and the Penn Phonetics Lab
Forced Aligner (Yuan & Liberman, 2008), as well as stop consonant burst
alignment using AutoVOT (Keshet et al., 2014). The tutorial provides a general
overview of each program, step-by-step instructions for running the program, as
well as several tips and tricks.
