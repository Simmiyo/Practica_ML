Polish Read Speech Corpus for Speech Tools and Services
This paper describes the speech processing activities conducted at the Polish
consortium of the CLARIN project. The purpose of this segment of the project
was to develop specific tools that would allow for automatic and semi-automatic
processing of large quantities of acoustic speech data. The tools include the
following: grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, speech-to-text alignment, voice
activity detection, speaker diarization, keyword spotting and automatic speech
transcription. Furthermore, in order to develop these tools, a large
high-quality studio speech corpus was recorded and released under an open
license, to encourage development in the area of Polish speech research.
Another purpose of the corpus was to serve as a reference for studies in
phonetics and pronunciation. All the tools and resources were released on the
the Polish CLARIN website. This paper discusses the current status and future
plans for the project.
