Building a Lemmatizer and a Spell-checker for Sorani Kurdish
The present paper aims at presenting a lemmatization and a word-level error
correction system for Sorani Kurdish. We propose a hybrid approach based on the
morphological rules and a n-gram language model. We have called our
lemmatization and error correction systems Peyv and R\^en\^us respectively,
which are the first tools presented for Sorani Kurdish to the best of our
knowledge. The Peyv lemmatizer has shown 86.7% accuracy. As for R\^en\^us,
using a lexicon, we have obtained 96.4% accuracy while without a lexicon, the
correction system has 87% accuracy. As two fundamental text processing tools,
these tools can pave the way for further researches on more natural language
processing applications for Sorani Kurdish.
