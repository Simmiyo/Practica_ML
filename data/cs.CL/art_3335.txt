Vietnamese Open Information Extraction
Open information extraction (OIE) is the process to extract relations and
their arguments automatically from textual documents without the need to
restrict the search to predefined relations. In recent years, several OIE
systems for the English language have been created but there is not any system
for the Vietnamese language. In this paper, we propose a method of OIE for
Vietnamese using a clause-based approach. Accordingly, we exploit Vietnamese
dependency parsing using grammar clauses that strives to consider all possible
relations in a sentence. The corresponding clause types are identified by their
propositions as extractable relations based on their grammatical functions of
constituents. As a result, our system is the first OIE system named vnOIE for
the Vietnamese language that can generate open relations and their arguments
from Vietnamese text with highly scalable extraction while being domain
independent. Experimental results show that our OIE system achieves promising
results with a precision of 83.71%.
