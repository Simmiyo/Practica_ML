What does Attention in Neural Machine Translation Pay Attention to?
Attention in neural machine translation provides the possibility to encode
relevant parts of the source sentence at each translation step. As a result,
attention is considered to be an alignment model as well. However, there is no
work that specifically studies attention and provides analysis of what is being
learned by attention models. Thus, the question still remains that how
attention is similar or different from the traditional alignment. In this
paper, we provide detailed analysis of attention and compare it to traditional
alignment. We answer the question of whether attention is only capable of
modelling translational equivalent or it captures more information. We show
that attention is different from alignment in some cases and is capturing
useful information other than alignments.
