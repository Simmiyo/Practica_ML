Cascaded Markov Models
This paper presents a new approach to partial parsing of context-free
structures. The approach is based on Markov Models. Each layer of the resulting
structure is represented by its own Markov Model, and output of a lower layer
is passed as input to the next higher layer. An empirical evaluation of the
method yields very good results for NP/PP chunking of German newspaper texts.
