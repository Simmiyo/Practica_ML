Entity Linking with people entity on Wikipedia
This paper introduces a new model that uses named entity recognition,
coreference resolution, and entity linking techniques, to approach the task of
linking people entities on Wikipedia people pages to their corresponding
Wikipedia pages if applicable. Our task is different from general and
traditional entity linking because we are working in a limited domain, namely,
people entities, and we are including pronouns as entities, whereas in the
past, pronouns were never considered as entities in entity linking. We have
built 2 models, both outperforms our baseline model significantly. The purpose
of our project is to build a model that could be use to generate cleaner data
for future entity linking tasks. Our contribution include a clean data set
consisting of 50Wikipedia people pages, and 2 entity linking models,
specifically tuned for this domain.
