Clustering based approach extracting collocations
The following study presents a collocation extraction approach based on
clustering technique. This study uses a combination of several classical
measures which cover all aspects of a given corpus then it suggests separating
bigrams found in the corpus in several disjoint groups according to the
probability of presence of collocations. This will allow excluding groups where
the presence of collocations is very unlikely and thus reducing in a meaningful
way the search space.
