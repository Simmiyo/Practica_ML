Using semantic clustering to support situation awareness on Twitter: The
  case of World Views
In recent years, situation awareness has been recognised as a critical part
of effective decision making, in particular for crisis management. One way to
extract value and allow for better situation awareness is to develop a system
capable of analysing a dataset of multiple posts, and clustering consistent
posts into different views or stories (or, world views). However, this can be
challenging as it requires an understanding of the data, including determining
what is consistent data, and what data corroborates other data. Attempting to
address these problems, this article proposes Subject-Verb-Object Semantic
Suffix Tree Clustering (SVOSSTC) and a system to support it, with a special
focus on Twitter content. The novelty and value of SVOSSTC is its emphasis on
utilising the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) typology in order to construct
semantically consistent world views, in which individuals---particularly those
involved in crisis response---might achieve an enhanced picture of a situation
from social media data. To evaluate our system and its ability to provide
enhanced situation awareness, we tested it against existing approaches,
including human data analysis, using a variety of real-world scenarios. The
results indicated a noteworthy degree of evidence (e.g., in cluster granularity
and meaningfulness) to affirm the suitability and rigour of our approach.
Moreover, these results highlight this article's proposals as innovative and
practical system contributions to the research field.
