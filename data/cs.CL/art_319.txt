Learning Phonotactics Using ILP
This paper describes experiments on learning Dutch phonotactic rules using
Inductive Logic Programming, a machine learning discipline based on inductive
logical operators. Two different ways of approaching the problem are
experimented with, and compared against each other as well as with related work
on the task. The results show a direct correspondence between the quality and
informedness of the background knowledge and the constructed theory,
demonstrating the ability of ILP to take good advantage of the prior domain
knowledge available. Further research is outlined.
