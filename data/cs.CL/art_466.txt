BioSimplify: an open source sentence simplification engine to improve
  recall in automatic biomedical information extraction
BioSimplify is an open source tool written in Java that introduces and
facilitates the use of a novel model for sentence simplification tuned for
automatic discourse analysis and information extraction (as opposed to sentence
simplification for improving human readability). The model is based on a
"shot-gun" approach that produces many different (simpler) versions of the
original sentence by combining variants of its constituent elements. This tool
is optimized for processing biomedical scientific literature such as the
abstracts indexed in PubMed. We tested our tool on its impact to the task of
PPI extraction and it improved the f-score of the PPI tool by around 7%, with
an improvement in recall of around 20%. The BioSimplify tool and test corpus
can be downloaded from https://biosimplify.sourceforge.net.
