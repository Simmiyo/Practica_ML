Neural Based Statement Classification for Biased Language
Biased language commonly occurs around topics which are of controversial
nature, thus, stirring disagreement between the different involved parties of a
discussion. This is due to the fact that for language and its use,
specifically, the understanding and use of phrases, the stances are cohesive
within the particular groups. However, such cohesiveness does not hold across
groups.
  In collaborative environments or environments where impartial language is
desired (e.g. Wikipedia, news media), statements and the language therein
should represent equally the involved parties and be neutrally phrased. Biased
language is introduced through the presence of inflammatory words or phrases,
or statements that may be incorrect or one-sided, thus violating such
consensus.
  In this work, we focus on the specific case of phrasing bias, which may be
introduced through specific inflammatory words or phrases in a statement. For
this purpose, we propose an approach that relies on a recurrent neural networks
in order to capture the inter-dependencies between words in a phrase that
introduced bias.
  We perform a thorough experimental evaluation, where we show the advantages
of a neural based approach over competitors that rely on word lexicons and
other hand-crafted features in detecting biased language. We are able to
distinguish biased statements with a precision of P=0.92, thus significantly
outperforming baseline models with an improvement of over 30%. Finally, we
release the largest corpus of statements annotated for biased language.
