GLEU Without Tuning
The GLEU metric was proposed for evaluating grammatical error corrections
using n-gram overlap with a set of reference sentences, as opposed to
precision/recall of specific annotated errors (Napoles et al., 2015). This
paper describes improvements made to the GLEU metric that address problems that
arise when using an increasing number of reference sets. Unlike the originally
presented metric, the modified metric does not require tuning. We recommend
that this version be used instead of the original version.
