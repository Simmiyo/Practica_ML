Towards a Generic Framework for the Development of Unicode Based Digital
  Sindhi Dictionaries
Dictionaries are essence of any language providing vital linguistic recourse
for the language learners, researchers and scholars. This paper focuses on the
methodology and techniques used in developing software architecture for a
UBSESD (Unicode Based Sindhi to English and English to Sindhi Dictionary). The
proposed system provides an accurate solution for construction and
representation of Unicode based Sindhi characters in a dictionary implementing
Hash Structure algorithm and a custom java Object as its internal data
structure saved in a file. The System provides facilities for Insertion,
Deletion and Editing of new records of Sindhi. Through this framework any type
of Sindhi to English and English to Sindhi Dictionary (belonging to different
domains of knowledge, e.g. engineering, medicine, computer, biology etc.) could
be developed easily with accurate representation of Unicode Characters in font
independent manner.
