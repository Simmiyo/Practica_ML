Feature Unification in TAG Derivation Trees
The derivation trees of a tree adjoining grammar provide a first insight into
the sentence semantics, and are thus prime targets for generation systems. We
define a formalism, feature-based regular tree grammars, and a translation from
feature based tree adjoining grammars into this new formalism. The translation
preserves the derivation structures of the original grammar, and accounts for
feature unification.
