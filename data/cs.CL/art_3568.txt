NIHRIO at SemEval-2018 Task 3: A Simple and Accurate Neural Network
  Model for Irony Detection in Twitter
This paper describes our NIHRIO system for SemEval-2018 Task 3 "Irony
detection in English tweets". We propose to use a simple neural network
architecture of Multilayer Perceptron with various types of input features
including: lexical, syntactic, semantic and polarity features. Our system
achieves very high performance in both subtasks of binary and multi-class irony
detection in tweets. In particular, we rank third using the accuracy metric and
fifth using the F1 metric. Our code is available at
