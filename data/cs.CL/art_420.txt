Displacement Calculus
The Lambek calculus provides a foundation for categorial grammar in the form
of a logic of concatenation. But natural language is characterized by
dependencies which may also be discontinuous. In this paper we introduce the
displacement calculus, a generalization of Lambek calculus, which preserves its
good proof-theoretic properties while embracing discontinuiity and subsuming
it. We illustrate linguistic applications and prove Cut-elimination, the
subformula property, and decidability
