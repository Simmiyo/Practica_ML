Fine-tuning Tree-LSTM for phrase-level sentiment classification on a
  Polish dependency treebank. Submission to PolEval task 2
We describe a variant of Child-Sum Tree-LSTM deep neural network (Tai et al,
2015) fine-tuned for working with dependency trees and morphologically rich
languages using the example of Polish. Fine-tuning included applying a custom
regularization technique (zoneout, described by (Krueger et al., 2016), and
further adapted for Tree-LSTMs) as well as using pre-trained word embeddings
enhanced with sub-word information (Bojanowski et al., 2016). The system was
implemented in PyTorch and evaluated on phrase-level sentiment labeling task as
part of the PolEval competition.
