The syntactic processing of particles in Japanese spoken language
Particles fullfill several distinct central roles in the Japanese language.
They can mark arguments as well as adjuncts, can be functional or have semantic
funtions. There is, however, no straightforward matching from particles to
functions, as, e.g., GA can mark the subject, the object or an adjunct of a
sentence. Particles can cooccur. Verbal arguments that could be identified by
particles can be eliminated in the Japanese sentence. And finally, in spoken
language particles are often omitted. A proper treatment of particles is thus
necessary to make an analysis of Japanese sentences possible. Our treatment is
based on an empirical investigation of 800 dialogues. We set up a type
hierarchy of particles motivated by their subcategorizational and
modificational behaviour. This type hierarchy is part of the Japanese syntax in
VERBMOBIL.
