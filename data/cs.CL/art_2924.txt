NNVLP: A Neural Network-Based Vietnamese Language Processing Toolkit
This paper demonstrates neural network-based toolkit namely NNVLP for
essential Vietnamese language processing tasks including part-of-speech (POS)
tagging, chunking, named entity recognition (NER). Our toolkit is a combination
of bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN), Conditional Random Field (CRF), using pre-trained word embeddings as
input, which achieves state-of-the-art results on these three tasks. We provide
both API and web demo for this toolkit.
