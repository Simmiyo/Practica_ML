Automatic Identification of AltLexes using Monolingual Parallel Corpora
The automatic identification of discourse relations is still a challenging
task in natural language processing. Discourse connectives, such as "since" or
"but", are the most informative cues to identify explicit relations; however
discourse parsers typically use a closed inventory of such connectives. As a
result, discourse relations signaled by markers outside these inventories (i.e.
AltLexes) are not detected as effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel
method to leverage parallel corpora in text simplification and lexical
resources to automatically identify alternative lexicalizations that signal
discourse relation. When applied to the Simple Wikipedia and Newsela corpora
along with WordNet and the PPDB, the method allowed the automatic discovery of
91 AltLexes.
