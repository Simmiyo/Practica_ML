Hindi to English Transfer Based Machine Translation System
In large societies like India there is a huge demand to convert one human
language into another. Lots of work has been done in this area. Many transfer
based MTS have developed for English to other languages, as MANTRA CDAC Pune,
MATRA CDAC Pune, SHAKTI IISc Bangalore and IIIT Hyderabad. Still there is a
little work done for Hindi to other languages. Currently we are working on it.
In this paper we focus on designing a system, that translate the document from
Hindi to English by using transfer based approach. This system takes an input
text check its structure through parsing. Reordering rules are used to generate
the text in target language. It is better than Corpus Based MTS because Corpus
Based MTS require large amount of word aligned data for translation that is not
available for many languages while Transfer Based MTS requires only knowledge
of both the languages(source language and target language) to make transfer
rules. We get correct translation for simple assertive sentences and almost
correct for complex and compound sentences.
