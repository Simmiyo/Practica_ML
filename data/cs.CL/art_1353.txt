Multi-Language Identification Using Convolutional Recurrent Neural
  Network
Language Identification, being an important aspect of Automatic Speaker
Recognition has had many changes and new approaches to ameliorate performance
over the last decade. We compare the performance of using audio spectrum in the
log scale and using Polyphonic sound sequences from raw audio samples to train
the neural network and to classify speech as either English or Spanish. To
achieve this, we use the novel approach of using a Convolutional Recurrent
Neural Network using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) or a Gated Recurrent Unit
(GRU) for forward propagation of the neural network. Our hypothesis is that the
performance of using polyphonic sound sequence as features and both LSTM and
GRU as the gating mechanisms for the neural network outperform the traditional
MFCC features using a unidirectional Deep Neural Network.
