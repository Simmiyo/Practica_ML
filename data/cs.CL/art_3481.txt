Preparing Bengali-English Code-Mixed Corpus for Sentiment Analysis of
  Indian Languages
Analysis of informative contents and sentiments of social users has been
attempted quite intensively in the recent past. Most of the systems are usable
only for monolingual data and fails or gives poor results when used on data
with code-mixing property. To gather attention and encourage researchers to
work on this crisis, we prepared gold standard Bengali-English code-mixed data
with language and polarity tag for sentiment analysis purposes. In this paper,
we discuss the systems we prepared to collect and filter raw Twitter data. In
order to reduce manual work while annotation, hybrid systems combining rule
based and supervised models were developed for both language and sentiment
tagging. The final corpus was annotated by a group of annotators following a
few guidelines. The gold standard corpus thus obtained has impressive
inter-annotator agreement obtained in terms of Kappa values. Various metrics
like Code-Mixed Index (CMI), Code-Mixed Factor (CF) along with various aspects
(language and emotion) also qualitatively polled the code-mixed and sentiment
properties of the corpus.
