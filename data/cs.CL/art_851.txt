Using Sentence Plausibility to Learn the Semantics of Transitive Verbs
The functional approach to compositional distributional semantics considers
transitive verbs to be linear maps that transform the distributional vectors
representing nouns into a vector representing a sentence. We conduct an initial
investigation that uses a matrix consisting of the parameters of a logistic
regression classifier trained on a plausibility task as a transitive verb
function. We compare our method to a commonly used corpus-based method for
constructing a verb matrix and find that the plausibility training may be more
effective for disambiguation tasks.
