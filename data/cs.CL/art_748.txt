Spelling Error Trends and Patterns in Sindhi
Statistical error Correction technique is the most accurate and widely used
approach today, but for a language like Sindhi which is a low resourced
language the trained corpora's are not available, so the statistical techniques
are not possible at all. Instead a useful alternative would be to exploit
various spelling error trends in Sindhi by using a Rule based approach. For
designing such technique an essential prerequisite would be to study the
various error patterns in a language. This pa per presents various studies of
spelling error trends and their types in Sindhi Language. The research shows
that the error trends common to all languages are also encountered in Sindhi
but their do exist some error patters that are catered specifically to a Sindhi
language.
