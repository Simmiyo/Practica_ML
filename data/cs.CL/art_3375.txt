Biomedical term normalization of EHRs with UMLS
This paper presents a novel prototype for biomedical term normalization of
electronic health record excerpts with the Unified Medical Language System
(UMLS) Metathesaurus. Despite being multilingual and cross-lingual by design,
we first focus on processing clinical text in Spanish because there is no
existing tool for this language and for this specific purpose. The tool is
based on Apache Lucene to index the Metathesaurus and generate mapping
candidates from input text. It uses the IXA pipeline for basic language
processing and resolves ambiguities with the UKB toolkit. It has been evaluated
by measuring its agreement with MetaMap in two English-Spanish parallel
corpora. In addition, we present a web-based interface for the tool.
