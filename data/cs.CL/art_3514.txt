Expressivity in TTS from Semantics and Pragmatics
In this paper we present ongoing work to produce an expressive TTS reader
that can be used both in text and dialogue applications. The system called
SPARSAR has been used to read (English) poetry so far but it can now be applied
to any text. The text is fully analyzed both at phonetic and phonological
level, and at syntactic and semantic level. In addition, the system has access
to a restricted list of typical pragmatically marked phrases and expressions
that are used to convey specific discourse function and speech acts and need
specialized intonational contours. The text is transformed into a poem-like
structures, where each line corresponds to a Breath Group, semantically and
syntactically consistent. Stanzas correspond to paragraph boundaries.
Analogical parameters are related to ToBI theoretical indices but their number
is doubled. In this paper, we concentrate on short stories and fables.
