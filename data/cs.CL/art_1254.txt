A Paradigm for Situated and Goal-Driven Language Learning
A distinguishing property of human intelligence is the ability to flexibly
use language in order to communicate complex ideas with other humans in a
variety of contexts. Research in natural language dialogue should focus on
designing communicative agents which can integrate themselves into these
contexts and productively collaborate with humans. In this abstract, we propose
a general situated language learning paradigm which is designed to bring about
robust language agents able to cooperate productively with humans.
