Why we have switched from building full-fledged taxonomies to simply
  detecting hypernymy relations
The study of taxonomies and hypernymy relations has been extensive on the
Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature. However, the evaluation of
taxonomy learning approaches has been traditionally troublesome, as it mainly
relies on ad-hoc experiments which are hardly reproducible and manually
expensive. Partly because of this, current research has been lately focusing on
the hypernymy detection task. In this paper we reflect on this trend, analyzing
issues related to current evaluation procedures. Finally, we propose three
potential avenues for future work so that is-a relations and resources based on
them play a more important role in downstream NLP applications.
