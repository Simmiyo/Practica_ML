Effective XML Representation for Spoken Language in Organisations
Spoken Language can be used to provide insights into organisational
processes, unfortunately transcription and coding stages are very time
consuming and expensive. The concept of partial transcription and coding is
proposed in which spoken language is indexed prior to any subsequent
processing. The functional linguistic theory of texture is used to describe the
effects of partial transcription on observational records. The standard used to
encode transcript context and metadata is called CHAT, but a previous XML
schema developed to implement it contains design assumptions that make it
difficult to support partial transcription for example. This paper describes a
more effective XML schema that overcomes many of these problems and is intended
for use in applications that support the rapid development of spoken language
deliverables.
