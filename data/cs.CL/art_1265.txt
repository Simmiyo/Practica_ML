Personalized Machine Translation: Preserving Original Author Traits
The language that we produce reflects our personality, and various personal
and demographic characteristics can be detected in natural language texts. We
focus on one particular personal trait of the author, gender, and study how it
is manifested in original texts and in translations. We show that author's
gender has a powerful, clear signal in originals texts, but this signal is
obfuscated in human and machine translation. We then propose simple
domain-adaptation techniques that help retain the original gender traits in the
translation, without harming the quality of the translation, thereby creating
more personalized machine translation systems.
