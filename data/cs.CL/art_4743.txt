Unsupervised cross-lingual matching of product classifications
Unsupervised cross-lingual embeddings mapping has provided a unique tool for
completely unsupervised translation even for languages with different scripts.
In this work we use this method for the task of unsupervised cross-lingual
matching of product classifications. Our work also investigates limitations of
unsupervised vector alignment and we also suggest two other techniques for
aligning product classifications based on their descriptions: using
hierarchical information and translations.
