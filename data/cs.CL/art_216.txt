Evaluating the Effectiveness of Ensembles of Decision Trees in
  Disambiguating Senseval Lexical Samples
This paper presents an evaluation of an ensemble--based system that
participated in the English and Spanish lexical sample tasks of Senseval-2. The
system combines decision trees of unigrams, bigrams, and co--occurrences into a
single classifier. The analysis is extended to include the Senseval-1 data.
