Modeling Semantics with Gated Graph Neural Networks for Knowledge Base
  Question Answering
The most approaches to Knowledge Base Question Answering are based on
semantic parsing. In this paper, we address the problem of learning vector
representations for complex semantic parses that consist of multiple entities
and relations. Previous work largely focused on selecting the correct semantic
relations for a question and disregarded the structure of the semantic parse:
the connections between entities and the directions of the relations. We
propose to use Gated Graph Neural Networks to encode the graph structure of the
semantic parse. We show on two data sets that the graph networks outperform all
baseline models that do not explicitly model the structure. The error analysis
confirms that our approach can successfully process complex semantic parses.
