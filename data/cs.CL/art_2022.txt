Desiderata for Vector-Space Word Representations
A plethora of vector-space representations for words is currently available,
which is growing. These consist of fixed-length vectors containing real values,
which represent a word. The result is a representation upon which the power of
many conventional information processing and data mining techniques can be
brought to bear, as long as the representations are designed with some
forethought and fit certain constraints. This paper details desiderata for the
design of vector space representations of words.
