Measuring Global Similarity between Texts
We propose a new similarity measure between texts which, contrary to the
current state-of-the-art approaches, takes a global view of the texts to be
compared. We have implemented a tool to compute our textual distance and
conducted experiments on several corpuses of texts. The experiments show that
our methods can reliably identify different global types of texts.
