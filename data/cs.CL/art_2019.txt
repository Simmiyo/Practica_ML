Resolving Out-of-Vocabulary Words with Bilingual Embeddings in Machine
  Translation
Out-of-vocabulary words account for a large proportion of errors in machine
translation systems, especially when the system is used on a different domain
than the one where it was trained. In order to alleviate the problem, we
propose to use a log-bilinear softmax-based model for vocabulary expansion,
such that given an out-of-vocabulary source word, the model generates a
probabilistic list of possible translations in the target language. Our model
uses only word embeddings trained on significantly large unlabelled monolingual
corpora and trains over a fairly small, word-to-word bilingual dictionary. We
input this probabilistic list into a standard phrase-based statistical machine
translation system and obtain consistent improvements in translation quality on
the English-Spanish language pair. Especially, we get an improvement of 3.9
BLEU points when tested over an out-of-domain test set.
