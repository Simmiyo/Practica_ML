Development of a Hindi Lemmatizer
We live in a translingual society, in order to communicate with people from
different parts of the world we need to have an expertise in their respective
languages. Learning all these languages is not at all possible; therefore we
need a mechanism which can do this task for us. Machine translators have
emerged as a tool which can perform this task. In order to develop a machine
translator we need to develop several different rules. The very first module
that comes in machine translation pipeline is morphological analysis. Stemming
and lemmatization comes under morphological analysis. In this paper we have
created a lemmatizer which generates rules for removing the affixes along with
the addition of rules for creating a proper root word.
