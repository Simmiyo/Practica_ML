Learning Better Word Embedding by Asymmetric Low-Rank Projection of
  Knowledge Graph
Word embedding, which refers to low-dimensional dense vector representations
of natural words, has demonstrated its power in many natural language
processing tasks. However, it may suffer from the inaccurate and incomplete
information contained in the free text corpus as training data. To tackle this
challenge, there have been quite a few works that leverage knowledge graphs as
an additional information source to improve the quality of word embedding.
Although these works have achieved certain success, they have neglected some
important facts about knowledge graphs: (i) many relationships in knowledge
graphs are \emph{many-to-one}, \emph{one-to-many} or even \emph{many-to-many},
rather than simply \emph{one-to-one}; (ii) most head entities and tail entities
in knowledge graphs come from very different semantic spaces. To address these
issues, in this paper, we propose a new algorithm named ProjectNet. ProjecNet
models the relationships between head and tail entities after transforming them
with different low-rank projection matrices. The low-rank projection can allow
non \emph{one-to-one} relationships between entities, while different
projection matrices for head and tail entities allow them to originate in
different semantic spaces. The experimental results demonstrate that ProjectNet
yields more accurate word embedding than previous works, thus leads to clear
improvements in various natural language processing tasks.
