Un résumeur à base de graphes, indépéndant de la langue
In this paper we present REG, a graph-based approach for study a fundamental
problem of Natural Language Processing (NLP): the automatic text summarization.
The algorithm maps a document as a graph, then it computes the weight of their
sentences. We have applied this approach to summarize documents in three
languages.
