A simple but tough-to-beat baseline for the Fake News Challenge stance
  detection task
Identifying public misinformation is a complicated and challenging task. An
important part of checking the veracity of a specific claim is to evaluate the
stance different news sources take towards the assertion. Automatic stance
evaluation, i.e. stance detection, would arguably facilitate the process of
fact checking. In this paper, we present our stance detection system which
claimed third place in Stage 1 of the Fake News Challenge. Despite our
straightforward approach, our system performs at a competitive level with the
complex ensembles of the top two winning teams. We therefore propose our system
as the 'simple but tough-to-beat baseline' for the Fake News Challenge stance
detection task.
