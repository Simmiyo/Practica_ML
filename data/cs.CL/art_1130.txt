The Improvement of Negative Sentences Translation in English-to-Korean
  Machine Translation
This paper describes the algorithm for translating English negative sentences
into Korean in English-Korean Machine Translation (EKMT). The proposed
algorithm is based on the comparative study of English and Korean negative
sentences. The earlier translation software cannot translate English negative
sentences into accurate Korean equivalents. We established a new algorithm for
the negative sentence translation and evaluated it.
