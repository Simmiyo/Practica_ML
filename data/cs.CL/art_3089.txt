Compiling and Processing Historical and Contemporary Portuguese Corpora
This technical report describes the framework used for processing three large
Portuguese corpora. Two corpora contain texts from newspapers, one published in
Brazil and the other published in Portugal. The third corpus is Colonia, a
historical Portuguese collection containing texts written between the 16th and
the early 20th century. The report presents pre-processing methods,
segmentation, and annotation of the corpora as well as indexing and querying
methods. Finally, it presents published research papers using the corpora.
