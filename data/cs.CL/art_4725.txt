Open Subtitles Paraphrase Corpus for Six Languages
This paper accompanies the release of Opusparcus, a new paraphrase corpus for
six European languages: German, English, Finnish, French, Russian, and Swedish.
The corpus consists of paraphrases, that is, pairs of sentences in the same
language that mean approximately the same thing. The paraphrases are extracted
from the OpenSubtitles2016 corpus, which contains subtitles from movies and TV
shows. The informal and colloquial genre that occurs in subtitles makes such
data a very interesting language resource, for instance, from the perspective
of computer assisted language learning. For each target language, the
Opusparcus data have been partitioned into three types of data sets: training,
development and test sets. The training sets are large, consisting of millions
of sentence pairs, and have been compiled automatically, with the help of
probabilistic ranking functions. The development and test sets consist of
sentence pairs that have been checked manually; each set contains approximately
1000 sentence pairs that have been verified to be acceptable paraphrases by two
annotators.
