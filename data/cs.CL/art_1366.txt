A Neural Architecture Mimicking Humans End-to-End for Natural Language
  Inference
In this work we use the recent advances in representation learning to propose
a neural architecture for the problem of natural language inference. Our
approach is aligned to mimic how a human does the natural language inference
process given two statements. The model uses variants of Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM), attention mechanism and composable neural networks, to carry out the
task. Each part of our model can be mapped to a clear functionality humans do
for carrying out the overall task of natural language inference. The model is
end-to-end differentiable enabling training by stochastic gradient descent. On
Stanford Natural Language Inference(SNLI) dataset, the proposed model achieves
better accuracy numbers than all published models in literature.
