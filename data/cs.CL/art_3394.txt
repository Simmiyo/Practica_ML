Linguistic unit discovery from multi-modal inputs in unwritten
  languages: Summary of the "Speaking Rosetta" JSALT 2017 Workshop
We summarize the accomplishments of a multi-disciplinary workshop exploring
the computational and scientific issues surrounding the discovery of linguistic
units (subwords and words) in a language without orthography. We study the
replacement of orthographic transcriptions by images and/or translated text in
a well-resourced language to help unsupervised discovery from raw speech.
