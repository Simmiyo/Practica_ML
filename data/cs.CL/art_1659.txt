Méthodes pour la représentation informatisée de données
  lexicales / Methoden der Speicherung lexikalischer Daten
In recent years, new developments in the area of lexicography have altered
not only the management, processing and publishing of lexicographical data, but
also created new types of products such as electronic dictionaries and
thesauri. These expand the range of possible uses of lexical data and support
users with more flexibility, for instance in assisting human translation. In
this article, we give a short and easy-to-understand introduction to the
problematic nature of the storage, display and interpretation of lexical data.
We then describe the main methods and specifications used to build and
represent lexical data. This paper is targeted for the following groups of
people: linguists, lexicographers, IT specialists, computer linguists and all
others who wish to learn more about the modelling, representation and
visualization of lexical knowledge. This paper is written in two languages:
French and German.
