An empirical study for Vietnamese dependency parsing
This paper presents an empirical comparison of different dependency parsers
for Vietnamese, which has some unusual characteristics such as copula drop and
verb serialization. Experimental results show that the neural network-based
parsers perform significantly better than the traditional parsers. We report
the highest parsing scores published to date for Vietnamese with the labeled
attachment score (LAS) at 73.53% and the unlabeled attachment score (UAS) at
80.66%.
