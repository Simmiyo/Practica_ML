When silver glitters more than gold: Bootstrapping an Italian
  part-of-speech tagger for Twitter
We bootstrap a state-of-the-art part-of-speech tagger to tag Italian Twitter
data, in the context of the Evalita 2016 PoSTWITA shared task. We show that
training the tagger on native Twitter data enriched with little amounts of
specifically selected gold data and additional silver-labelled data scraped
from Facebook, yields better results than using large amounts of manually
annotated data from a mix of genres.
