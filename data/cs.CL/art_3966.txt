UMDSub at SemEval-2018 Task 2: Multilingual Emoji Prediction
  Multi-channel Convolutional Neural Network on Subword Embedding
This paper describes the UMDSub system that participated in Task 2 of
SemEval-2018. We developed a system that predicts an emoji given the raw text
in a English tweet. The system is a Multi-channel Convolutional Neural Network
based on subword embeddings for the representation of tweets. This model
improves on character or word based methods by about 2\%. Our system placed
21st of 48 participating systems in the official evaluation.
