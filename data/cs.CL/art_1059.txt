Using Ontology-Based Context in the Portuguese-English Translation of
  Homographs in Textual Dialogues
This paper introduces a novel approach to tackle the existing gap on message
translations in dialogue systems. Currently, submitted messages to the dialogue
systems are considered as isolated sentences. Thus, missing context information
impede the disambiguation of homographs words in ambiguous sentences. Our
approach solves this disambiguation problem by using concepts over existing
ontologies.
