Standards for Language Resources
The goal of this paper is two-fold: to present an abstract data model for
linguistic annotations and its implementation using XML, RDF and related
standards; and to outline the work of a newly formed committee of the
International Standards Organization (ISO), ISO/TC 37/SC 4 Language Resource
Management, which will use this work as its starting point.
