A generic tool to generate a lexicon for NLP from Lexicon-Grammar tables
Lexicon-Grammar tables constitute a large-coverage syntactic lexicon but they
cannot be directly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications
because they sometimes rely on implicit information. In this paper, we
introduce LGExtract, a generic tool for generating a syntactic lexicon for NLP
from the Lexicon-Grammar tables. It is based on a global table that contains
undefined information and on a unique extraction script including all
operations to be performed for all tables. We also present an experiment that
has been conducted to generate a new lexicon of French verbs and predicative
nouns.
