Parsing of Myanmar sentences with function tagging
This paper describes the use of Naive Bayes to address the task of assigning
function tags and context free grammar (CFG) to parse Myanmar sentences. Part
of the challenge of statistical function tagging for Myanmar sentences comes
from the fact that Myanmar has free-phrase-order and a complex morphological
system. Function tagging is a pre-processing step for parsing. In the task of
function tagging, we use the functional annotated corpus and tag Myanmar
sentences with correct segmentation, POS (part-of-speech) tagging and chunking
information. We propose Myanmar grammar rules and apply context free grammar
(CFG) to find out the parse tree of function tagged Myanmar sentences.
Experiments show that our analysis achieves a good result with parsing of
simple sentences and three types of complex sentences.
