Enumeration of Extractive Oracle Summaries
To analyze the limitations and the future directions of the extractive
summarization paradigm, this paper proposes an Integer Linear Programming (ILP)
formulation to obtain extractive oracle summaries in terms of ROUGE-N. We also
propose an algorithm that enumerates all of the oracle summaries for a set of
reference summaries to exploit F-measures that evaluate which system summaries
contain how many sentences that are extracted as an oracle summary. Our
experimental results obtained from Document Understanding Conference (DUC)
corpora demonstrated the following: (1) room still exists to improve the
performance of extractive summarization; (2) the F-measures derived from the
enumerated oracle summaries have significantly stronger correlations with human
judgment than those derived from single oracle summaries.
