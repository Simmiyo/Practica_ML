Upcycle Your OCR: Reusing OCRs for Post-OCR Text Correction in Romanised
  Sanskrit
We propose a post-OCR text correction approach for digitising texts in
Romanised Sanskrit. Owing to the lack of resources our approach uses OCR models
trained for other languages written in Roman. Currently, there exists no
dataset available for Romanised Sanskrit OCR. So, we bootstrap a dataset of 430
images, scanned in two different settings and their corresponding ground truth.
For training, we synthetically generate training images for both the settings.
We find that the use of copying mechanism (Gu et al., 2016) yields a percentage
increase of 7.69 in Character Recognition Rate (CRR) than the current state of
the art model in solving monotone sequence-to-sequence tasks (Schnober et al.,
2016). We find that our system is robust in combating OCR-prone errors, as it
obtains a CRR of 87.01% from an OCR output with CRR of 35.76% for one of the
dataset settings. A human judgment survey performed on the models shows that
our proposed model results in predictions which are faster to comprehend and
faster to improve for a human than the other systems.
