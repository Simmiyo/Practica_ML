A Semantic Analyzer for the Comprehension of the Spontaneous Arabic
  Speech
This work is part of a large research project entitled "Or\'eodule" aimed at
developing tools for automatic speech recognition, translation, and synthesis
for Arabic language. Our attention has mainly been focused on an attempt to
improve the probabilistic model on which our semantic decoder is based. To
achieve this goal, we have decided to test the influence of the pertinent
context use, and of the contextual data integration of different types, on the
effectiveness of the semantic decoder. The findings are quite satisfactory.
