Menzerath-Altmann Law for Syntactic Structures in Ukrainian
In the paper, the definition of clause suitable for an automated processing
of a Ukrainian text is proposed. The Menzerath-Altmann law is verified on the
sentence level and the parameters for the dependences of the clause length
counted in words and syllables on the sentence length counted in clauses are
calculated for "Perekhresni Stezhky" ("The Cross-Paths"), a novel by Ivan
Franko.
