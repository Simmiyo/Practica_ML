Translation Memory Retrieval Methods
Translation Memory (TM) systems are one of the most widely used translation
technologies. An important part of TM systems is the matching algorithm that
determines what translations get retrieved from the bank of available
translations to assist the human translator. Although detailed accounts of the
matching algorithms used in commercial systems can't be found in the
literature, it is widely believed that edit distance algorithms are used. This
paper investigates and evaluates the use of several matching algorithms,
including the edit distance algorithm that is believed to be at the heart of
most modern commercial TM systems. This paper presents results showing how well
various matching algorithms correlate with human judgments of helpfulness
(collected via crowdsourcing with Amazon's Mechanical Turk). A new algorithm
based on weighted n-gram precision that can be adjusted for translator length
preferences consistently returns translations judged to be most helpful by
translators for multiple domains and language pairs.
