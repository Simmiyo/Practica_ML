Robust Grammatical Analysis for Spoken Dialogue Systems
We argue that grammatical analysis is a viable alternative to concept
spotting for processing spoken input in a practical spoken dialogue system. We
discuss the structure of the grammar, and a model for robust parsing which
combines linguistic sources of information and statistical sources of
information. We discuss test results suggesting that grammatical processing
allows fast and accurate processing of spoken input.
