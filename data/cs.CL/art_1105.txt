Polysemy in Controlled Natural Language Texts
Computational semantics and logic-based controlled natural languages (CNL) do
not address systematically the word sense disambiguation problem of content
words, i.e., they tend to interpret only some functional words that are crucial
for construction of discourse representation structures. We show that
micro-ontologies and multi-word units allow integration of the rich and
polysemous multi-domain background knowledge into CNL thus providing
interpretation for the content words. The proposed approach is demonstrated by
extending the Attempto Controlled English (ACE) with polysemous and procedural
constructs resulting in a more natural CNL named PAO covering narrative
multi-domain texts.
