An Empirical Evaluation of various Deep Learning Architectures for
  Bi-Sequence Classification Tasks
Several tasks in argumentation mining and debating, question-answering, and
natural language inference involve classifying a sequence in the context of
another sequence (referred as bi-sequence classification). For several single
sequence classification tasks, the current state-of-the-art approaches are
based on recurrent and convolutional neural networks. On the other hand, for
bi-sequence classification problems, there is not much understanding as to the
best deep learning architecture. In this paper, we attempt to get an
understanding of this category of problems by extensive empirical evaluation of
19 different deep learning architectures (specifically on different ways of
handling context) for various problems originating in natural language
processing like debating, textual entailment and question-answering. Following
the empirical evaluation, we offer our insights and conclusions regarding the
architectures we have considered. We also establish the first deep learning
baselines for three argumentation mining tasks.
