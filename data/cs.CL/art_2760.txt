Improving Discourse Relation Projection to Build Discourse Annotated
  Corpora
The naive approach to annotation projection is not effective to project
discourse annotations from one language to another because implicit discourse
relations are often changed to explicit ones and vice-versa in the translation.
In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on the intersection between
statistical word-alignment models to identify unsupported discourse
annotations. This approach identified 65% of the unsupported annotations in the
English-French parallel sentences from Europarl. By filtering out these
unsupported annotations, we induced the first PDTB-style discourse annotated
corpus for French from Europarl. We then used this corpus to train a classifier
to identify the discourse-usage of French discourse connectives and show a 15%
improvement of F1-score compared to the classifier trained on the non-filtered
annotations.
