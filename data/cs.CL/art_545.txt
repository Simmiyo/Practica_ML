UNL Based Bangla Natural Text Conversion - Predicate Preserving Parser
  Approach
Universal Networking Language (UNL) is a declarative formal language that is
used to represent semantic data extracted from natural language texts. This
paper presents a novel approach to converting Bangla natural language text into
UNL using a method known as Predicate Preserving Parser (PPP) technique. PPP
performs morphological, syntactic and semantic, and lexical analysis of text
synchronously. This analysis produces a semantic-net like structure represented
using UNL. We demonstrate how Bangla texts are analyzed following the PPP
technique to produce UNL documents which can then be translated into any other
suitable natural language facilitating the opportunity to develop a universal
language translation method via UNL.
