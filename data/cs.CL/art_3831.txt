Deep Neural Machine Translation with Weakly-Recurrent Units
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have represented for years the state of the
art in neural machine translation. Recently, new architectures have been
proposed, which can leverage parallel computation on GPUs better than classical
RNNs. Faster training and inference combined with different
sequence-to-sequence modeling also lead to performance improvements. While the
new models completely depart from the original recurrent architecture, we
decided to investigate how to make RNNs more efficient. In this work, we
propose a new recurrent NMT architecture, called Simple Recurrent NMT, built on
a class of fast and weakly-recurrent units that use layer normalization and
multiple attentions. Our experiments on the WMT14 English-to-German and WMT16
English-Romanian benchmarks show that our model represents a valid alternative
to LSTMs, as it can achieve better results at a significantly lower
computational cost.
