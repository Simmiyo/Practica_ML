Quality expectations of machine translation
Machine Translation (MT) is being deployed for a range of use-cases by
millions of people on a daily basis. There should, therefore, be no doubt as to
the utility of MT. However, not everyone is convinced that MT can be useful,
especially as a productivity enhancer for human translators. In this chapter, I
address this issue, describing how MT is currently deployed, how its output is
evaluated and how this could be enhanced, especially as MT quality itself
improves. Central to these issues is the acceptance that there is no longer a
single 'gold standard' measure of quality, such that the situation in which MT
is deployed needs to be borne in mind, especially with respect to the expected
'shelf-life' of the translation itself.
