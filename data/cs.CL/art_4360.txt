Live Video Comment Generation Based on Surrounding Frames and Live
  Comments
In this paper, we propose the task of live comment generation. Live comments
are a new form of comments on videos, which can be regarded as a mixture of
comments and chats. A high-quality live comment should be not only relevant to
the video, but also interactive with other users. In this work, we first
construct a new dataset for live comment generation. Then, we propose a novel
end-to-end model to generate the human-like live comments by referring to the
video and the other users' comments. Finally, we evaluate our model on the
constructed dataset. Experimental results show that our method can
significantly outperform the baselines.
