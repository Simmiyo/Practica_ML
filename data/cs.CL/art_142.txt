A Novelty-based Evaluation Method for Information Retrieval
In information retrieval research, precision and recall have long been used
to evaluate IR systems. However, given that a number of retrieval systems
resembling one another are already available to the public, it is valuable to
retrieve novel relevant documents, i.e., documents that cannot be retrieved by
those existing systems. In view of this problem, we propose an evaluation
method that favors systems retrieving as many novel documents as possible. We
also used our method to evaluate systems that participated in the IREX
workshop.
