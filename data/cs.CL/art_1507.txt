Text Annotation Graphs: Annotating Complex Natural Language Phenomena
This paper introduces a new web-based software tool for annotating text, Text
Annotation Graphs, or TAG. It provides functionality for representing complex
relationships between words and word phrases that are not available in other
software tools, including the ability to define and visualize relationships
between the relationships themselves (semantic hypergraphs). Additionally, we
include an approach to representing text annotations in which annotation
subgraphs, or semantic summaries, are used to show relationships outside of the
sequential context of the text itself. Users can use these subgraphs to quickly
find similar structures within the current document or external annotated
documents. Initially, TAG was developed to support information extraction tasks
on a large database of biomedical articles. However, our software is flexible
enough to support a wide range of annotation tasks for any domain. Examples are
provided that showcase TAG's capabilities on morphological parsing and event
extraction tasks. The TAG software is available at: https://github.com/
