Un modèle générique d'organisation de corpus en ligne: application
  à la FReeBank
The few available French resources for evaluating linguistic models or
algorithms on other linguistic levels than morpho-syntax are either
insufficient from quantitative as well as qualitative point of view or not
freely accessible. Based on this fact, the FREEBANK project intends to create
French corpora constructed using manually revised output from a hybrid
Constraint Grammar parser and annotated on several linguistic levels
(structure, morpho-syntax, syntax, coreference), with the objective to make
them available on-line for research purposes. Therefore, we will focus on using
standard annotation schemes, integration of existing resources and maintenance
allowing for continuous enrichment of the annotations. Prior to the actual
presentation of the prototype that has been implemented, this paper describes a
generic model for the organization and deployment of a linguistic resource
archive, in compliance with the various works currently conducted within
international standardization initiatives (TEI and ISO/TC 37/SC 4).
