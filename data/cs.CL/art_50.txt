Detecting Sub-Topic Correspondence through Bipartite Term Clustering
This paper addresses a novel task of detecting sub-topic correspondence in a
pair of text fragments, enhancing common notions of text similarity. This task
is addressed by coupling corresponding term subsets through bipartite
clustering. The paper presents a cost-based clustering scheme and compares it
with a bipartite version of the single-link method, providing illustrating
results.
