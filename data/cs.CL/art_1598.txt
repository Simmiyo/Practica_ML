Application of Natural Language Processing to Determine User
  Satisfaction in Public Services
Research on customer satisfaction has increased substantially in recent
years. However, the relative importance and relationships between different
determinants of satisfaction remains uncertain. Moreover, quantitative studies
to date tend to test for significance of pre-determined factors thought to have
an influence with no scalable means to identify other causes of user
satisfaction. The gaps in knowledge make it difficult to use available
knowledge on user preference for public service improvement. Meanwhile, digital
technology development has enabled new methods to collect user feedback, for
example through online forums where users can comment freely on their
experience. New tools are needed to analyze large volumes of such feedback. Use
of topic models is proposed as a feasible solution to aggregate open-ended user
opinions that can be easily deployed in the public sector. Generated insights
can contribute to a more inclusive decision-making process in public service
provision. This novel methodological approach is applied to a case of service
reviews of publicly-funded primary care practices in England. Findings from the
analysis of 145,000 reviews covering almost 7,700 primary care centers indicate
that the quality of interactions with staff and bureaucratic exigencies are the
key issues driving user satisfaction across England.
