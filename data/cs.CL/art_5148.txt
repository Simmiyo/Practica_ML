Improving Robustness of Neural Dialog Systems in a Data-Efficient Way
  with Turn Dropout
Neural network-based dialog models often lack robustness to anomalous,
out-of-domain (OOD) user input which leads to unexpected dialog behavior and
thus considerably limits such models' usage in mission-critical production
environments. The problem is especially relevant in the setting of dialog
system bootstrapping with limited training data and no access to OOD examples.
In this paper, we explore the problem of robustness of such systems to
anomalous input and the associated to it trade-off in accuracies on seen and
unseen data. We present a new dataset for studying the robustness of dialog
systems to OOD input, which is bAbI Dialog Task 6 augmented with OOD content in
a controlled way. We then present turn dropout, a simple yet efficient negative
sampling-based technique for improving robustness of neural dialog models. We
demonstrate its effectiveness applied to Hybrid Code Network-family models
(HCNs) which reach state-of-the-art results on our OOD-augmented dataset as
well as the original one. Specifically, an HCN trained with turn dropout
achieves state-of-the-art performance of more than 75% per-utterance accuracy
on the augmented dataset's OOD turns and 74% F1-score as an OOD detector.
Furthermore, we introduce a Variational HCN enhanced with turn dropout which
achieves more than 56.5% accuracy on the original bAbI Task 6 dataset, thus
outperforming the initially reported HCN's result.
