A CRF Based POS Tagger for Code-mixed Indian Social Media Text
In this work, we describe a conditional random fields (CRF) based system for
Part-Of- Speech (POS) tagging of code-mixed Indian social media text as part of
our participation in the tool contest on POS tagging for codemixed Indian
social media text, held in conjunction with the 2016 International Conference
on Natural Language Processing, IIT(BHU), India. We participated only in
constrained mode contest for all three language pairs, Bengali-English,
Hindi-English and Telegu-English. Our system achieves the overall average F1
score of 79.99, which is the highest overall average F1 score among all 16
systems participated in constrained mode contest.
