BiographyNet: Extracting Relations Between People and Events
This paper describes BiographyNet, a digital humanities project (2012-2016)
that brings together researchers from history, computational linguistics and
computer science. The project uses data from the Biography Portal of the
Netherlands (BPN), which contains approximately 125,000 biographies from a
variety of Dutch biographical dictionaries from the eighteenth century until
now, describing around 76,000 individuals. BiographyNet's aim is to strengthen
the value of the portal and comparable biographical datasets for historical
research, by improving the search options and the presentation of its outcome,
with a historically justified NLP pipeline that works through a user evaluated
demonstrator. The project's main target group are professional historians. The
project therefore worked with two key concepts: "provenance" -understood as a
term allowing for both historical source criticism and for references to
data-management and programming interventions in digitized sources; and
"perspective" interpreted as inherent uncertainty concerning the interpretation
of historical results.
