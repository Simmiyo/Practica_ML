Review-Driven Multi-Label Music Style Classification by Exploiting Style
  Correlations
This paper explores a new natural language processing task, review-driven
multi-label music style classification. This task requires the system to
identify multiple styles of music based on its reviews on websites. The biggest
challenge lies in the complicated relations of music styles. It has brought
failure to many multi-label classification methods. To tackle this problem, we
propose a novel deep learning approach to automatically learn and exploit style
correlations. The proposed method consists of two parts: a label-graph based
neural network, and a soft training mechanism with correlation-based continuous
label representation. Experimental results show that our approach achieves
large improvements over the baselines on the proposed dataset. Especially, the
micro F1 is improved from 53.9 to 64.5, and the one-error is reduced from 30.5
to 22.6. Furthermore, the visualized analysis shows that our approach performs
well in capturing style correlations.
