N-gram and Neural Language Models for Discriminating Similar Languages
This paper describes our submission (named clac) to the 2016 Discriminating
Similar Languages (DSL) shared task. We participated in the closed Sub-task 1
(Set A) with two separate machine learning techniques. The first approach is a
character based Convolution Neural Network with a bidirectional long short term
memory (BiLSTM) layer (CLSTM), which achieved an accuracy of 78.45% with
minimal tuning. The second approach is a character-based n-gram model. This
last approach achieved an accuracy of 88.45% which is close to the accuracy of
89.38% achieved by the best submission, and allowed us to rank #7 overall.
