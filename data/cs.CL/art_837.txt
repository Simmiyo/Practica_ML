Correcting Errors in Digital Lexicographic Resources Using a Dictionary
  Manipulation Language
We describe a paradigm for combining manual and automatic error correction of
noisy structured lexicographic data. Modifications to the structure and
underlying text of the lexicographic data are expressed in a simple,
interpreted programming language. Dictionary Manipulation Language (DML)
commands identify nodes by unique identifiers, and manipulations are performed
using simple commands such as create, move, set text, etc. Corrected lexicons
are produced by applying sequences of DML commands to the source version of the
lexicon. DML commands can be written manually to repair one-off errors or
generated automatically to correct recurring problems. We discuss advantages of
the paradigm for the task of editing digital bilingual dictionaries.
