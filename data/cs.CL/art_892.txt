A new hybrid metric for verifying parallel corpora of Arabic-English
This paper discusses a new metric that has been applied to verify the quality
in translation between sentence pairs in parallel corpora of Arabic-English.
This metric combines two techniques, one based on sentence length and the other
based on compression code length. Experiments on sample test parallel
Arabic-English corpora indicate the combination of these two techniques
improves accuracy of the identification of satisfactory and unsatisfactory
sentence pairs compared to sentence length and compression code length alone.
The new method proposed in this research is effective at filtering noise and
reducing mis-translations resulting in greatly improved quality.
