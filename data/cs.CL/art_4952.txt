Towards End-to-end Automatic Code-Switching Speech Recognition
Speech recognition in mixed language has difficulties to adapt end-to-end
framework due to the lack of data and overlapping phone sets, for example in
words such as "one" in English and "w\`an" in Chinese. We propose a CTC-based
end-to-end automatic speech recognition model for intra-sentential
English-Mandarin code-switching. The model is trained by joint training on
monolingual datasets, and fine-tuning with the mixed-language corpus. During
the decoding process, we apply a beam search and combine CTC predictions and
language model score. The proposed method is effective in leveraging
monolingual corpus and detecting language transitions and it improves the CER
by 5%.
