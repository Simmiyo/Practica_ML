Improving Part-of-Speech Tagging for NLP Pipelines
This paper outlines the results of sentence level linguistics based rules for
improving part-of-speech tagging. It is well known that the performance of
complex NLP systems is negatively affected if one of the preliminary stages is
less than perfect. Errors in the initial stages in the pipeline have a
snowballing effect on the pipeline's end performance. We have created a set of
linguistics based rules at the sentence level which adjust part-of-speech tags
from state-of-the-art taggers. Comparison with state-of-the-art taggers on
widely used benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in tagging accuracy
and consequently in the quality and accuracy of NLP systems.
