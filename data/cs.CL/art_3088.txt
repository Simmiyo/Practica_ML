Building Chatbots from Forum Data: Model Selection Using Question
  Answering Metrics
We propose to use question answering (QA) data from Web forums to train
chatbots from scratch, i.e., without dialog training data. First, we extract
pairs of question and answer sentences from the typically much longer texts of
questions and answers in a forum. We then use these shorter texts to train
seq2seq models in a more efficient way. We further improve the parameter
optimization using a new model selection strategy based on QA measures.
Finally, we propose to use extrinsic evaluation with respect to a QA task as an
automatic evaluation method for chatbots. The evaluation shows that the model
achieves a MAP of 63.5% on the extrinsic task. Moreover, it can answer
correctly 49.5% of the questions when they are similar to questions asked in
the forum, and 47.3% of the questions when they are more conversational in
style.
