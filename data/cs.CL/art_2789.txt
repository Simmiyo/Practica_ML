Transition-Based Generation from Abstract Meaning Representations
This work addresses the task of generating English sentences from Abstract
Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. To cope with this task, we transform each
input AMR graph into a structure similar to a dependency tree and annotate it
with syntactic information by applying various predefined actions to it.
Subsequently, a sentence is obtained from this tree structure by visiting its
nodes in a specific order. We train maximum entropy models to estimate the
probability of each individual action and devise an algorithm that efficiently
approximates the best sequence of actions to be applied. Using a substandard
language model, our generator achieves a Bleu score of 27.4 on the LDC2014T12
test set, the best result reported so far without using silver standard
annotations from another corpus as additional training data.
