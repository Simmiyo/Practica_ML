Understanding and Improving Multi-Sense Word Embeddings via Extended
  Robust Principal Component Analysis
Unsupervised learned representations of polysemous words generate a large of
pseudo multi senses since unsupervised methods are overly sensitive to
contextual variations. In this paper, we address the pseudo multi-sense
detection for word embeddings by dimensionality reduction of sense pairs. We
propose a novel principal analysis method, termed Ex-RPCA, designed to detect
both pseudo multi senses and real multi senses. With Ex-RPCA, we empirically
show that pseudo multi senses are generated systematically in unsupervised
method. Moreover, the multi-sense word embeddings can by improved by a simple
linear transformation based on Ex-RPCA. Our improved word embedding outperform
the original one by 5.6 points on Stanford contextual word similarity (SCWS)
dataset. We hope our simple yet effective approach will help the linguistic
analysis of multi-sense word embeddings in the future.
