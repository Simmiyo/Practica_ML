Identifying Nominals with No Head Match Co-references Using Deep
  Learning
Identifying nominals with no head match is a long-standing challenge in
coreference resolution with current systems performing significantly worse than
humans. In this paper we present a new neural network architecture which
outperforms the current state-of-the-art system on the English portion of the
CoNLL 2012 Shared Task. This is done by using a logistic regression on features
produced by two submodels, one of which is has the architecture proposed in
[CM16a] while the other combines domain specific embeddings of the antecedent
and the mention. We also propose some simple additional features which seem to
improve performance for all models substantially, increasing F1 by almost 4% on
basic logistic regression and other complex models.
