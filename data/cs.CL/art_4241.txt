UniParse: A universal graph-based parsing toolkit
This paper describes the design and use of the graph-based parsing framework
and toolkit UniParse, released as an open-source python software package.
UniParse as a framework novelly streamlines research prototyping, development
and evaluation of graph-based dependency parsing architectures. UniParse does
this by enabling highly efficient, sufficiently independent, easily readable,
and easily extensible implementations for all dependency parser components. We
distribute the toolkit with ready-made configurations as re-implementations of
all current state-of-the-art first-order graph-based parsers, including even
more efficient Cython implementations of both encoders and decoders, as well as
the required specialised loss functions.
