Evaluating Unsupervised Dutch Word Embeddings as a Linguistic Resource
Word embeddings have recently seen a strong increase in interest as a result
of strong performance gains on a variety of tasks. However, most of this
research also underlined the importance of benchmark datasets, and the
difficulty of constructing these for a variety of language-specific tasks.
Still, many of the datasets used in these tasks could prove to be fruitful
linguistic resources, allowing for unique observations into language use and
variability. In this paper we demonstrate the performance of multiple types of
embeddings, created with both count and prediction-based architectures on a
variety of corpora, in two language-specific tasks: relation evaluation, and
dialect identification. For the latter, we compare unsupervised methods with a
traditional, hand-crafted dictionary. With this research, we provide the
embeddings themselves, the relation evaluation task benchmark for use in
further research, and demonstrate how the benchmarked embeddings prove a useful
unsupervised linguistic resource, effectively used in a downstream task.
