Domain Adversarial Training for Accented Speech Recognition
In this paper, we propose a domain adversarial training (DAT) algorithm to
alleviate the accented speech recognition problem. In order to reduce the
mismatch between labeled source domain data ("standard" accent) and unlabeled
target domain data (with heavy accents), we augment the learning objective for
a Kaldi TDNN network with a domain adversarial training (DAT) objective to
encourage the model to learn accent-invariant features. In experiments with
three Mandarin accents, we show that DAT yields up to 7.45% relative character
error rate reduction when we do not have transcriptions of the accented speech,
compared with the baseline trained on standard accent data only. We also find a
benefit from DAT when used in combination with training from automatic
transcriptions on the accented data. Furthermore, we find that DAT is superior
to multi-task learning for accented speech recognition.
