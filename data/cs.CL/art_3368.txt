Question-Answer Selection in User to User Marketplace Conversations
Sellers in user to user marketplaces can be inundated with questions from
potential buyers. Answers are often already available in the product
description. We collected a dataset of around 590K such questions and answers
from conversations in an online marketplace. We propose a question answering
system that selects a sentence from the product description using a
neural-network ranking model. We explore multiple encoding strategies, with
recurrent neural networks and feed-forward attention layers yielding good
results. This paper presents a demo to interactively pose buyer questions and
visualize the ranking scores of product description sentences from live online
listings.
