Deep learning for language understanding of mental health concepts
  derived from Cognitive Behavioural Therapy
In recent years, we have seen deep learning and distributed representations
of words and sentences make impact on a number of natural language processing
tasks, such as similarity, entailment and sentiment analysis. Here we introduce
a new task: understanding of mental health concepts derived from Cognitive
Behavioural Therapy (CBT). We define a mental health ontology based on the CBT
principles, annotate a large corpus where this phenomena is exhibited and
perform understanding using deep learning and distributed representations. Our
results show that the performance of deep learning models combined with word
embeddings or sentence embeddings significantly outperform non-deep-learning
models in this difficult task. This understanding module will be an essential
component of a statistical dialogue system delivering therapy.
