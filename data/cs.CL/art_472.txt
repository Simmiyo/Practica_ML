Language understanding as a step towards human level intelligence -
  automatizing the construction of the initial dictionary from example
  sentences
For a system to understand natural language, it needs to be able to take
natural language text and answer questions given in natural language with
respect to that text; it also needs to be able to follow instructions given in
natural language. To achieve this, a system must be able to process natural
language and be able to capture the knowledge within that text. Thus it needs
to be able to translate natural language text into a formal language. We
discuss our approach to do this, where the translation is achieved by composing
the meaning of words in a sentence. Our initial approach uses an inverse lambda
method that we developed (and other methods) to learn meaning of words from
meaning of sentences and an initial lexicon. We then present an improved method
where the initial lexicon is also learned by analyzing the training sentence
and meaning pairs. We evaluate our methods and compare them with other existing
methods on a corpora of database querying and robot command and control.
