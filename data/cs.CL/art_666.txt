Development and Transcription of Assamese Speech Corpus
A balanced speech corpus is the basic need for any speech processing task. In
this report we describe our effort on development of Assamese speech corpus. We
mainly focused on some issues and challenges faced during development of the
corpus. Being a less computationally aware language, this is the first effort
to develop speech corpus for Assamese. As corpus development is an ongoing
process, in this paper we report only the initial task.
