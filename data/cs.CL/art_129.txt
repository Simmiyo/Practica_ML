Introduction to the CoNLL-2000 Shared Task: Chunking
We describe the CoNLL-2000 shared task: dividing text into syntactically
related non-overlapping groups of words, so-called text chunking. We give
background information on the data sets, present a general overview of the
systems that have taken part in the shared task and briefly discuss their
performance.
