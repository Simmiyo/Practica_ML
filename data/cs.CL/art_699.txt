Multi-Topic Multi-Document Summarizer
Current multi-document summarization systems can successfully extract summary
sentences, however with many limitations including: low coverage, inaccurate
extraction to important sentences, redundancy and poor coherence among the
selected sentences. The present study introduces a new concept of centroid
approach and reports new techniques for extracting summary sentences for
multi-document. In both techniques keyphrases are used to weigh sentences and
documents. The first summarization technique (Sen-Rich) prefers maximum
richness sentences. While the second (Doc-Rich), prefers sentences from
centroid document. To demonstrate the new summarization system application to
extract summaries of Arabic documents we performed two experiments. First, we
applied Rouge measure to compare the new techniques among systems presented at
TAC2011. The results show that Sen-Rich outperformed all systems in ROUGE-S.
Second, the system was applied to summarize multi-topic documents. Using human
evaluators, the results show that Doc-Rich is the superior, where summary
sentences characterized by extra coverage and more cohesion.
