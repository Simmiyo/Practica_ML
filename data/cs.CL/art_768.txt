The Frobenius anatomy of word meanings I: subject and object relative
  pronouns
This paper develops a compositional vector-based semantics of subject and
object relative pronouns within a categorical framework. Frobenius algebras are
used to formalise the operations required to model the semantics of relative
pronouns, including passing information between the relative clause and the
modified noun phrase, as well as copying, combining, and discarding parts of
the relative clause. We develop two instantiations of the abstract semantics,
one based on a truth-theoretic approach and one based on corpus statistics.
