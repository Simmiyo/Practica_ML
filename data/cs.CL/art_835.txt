The Visualization of Change in Word Meaning over Time using Temporal
  Word Embeddings
We describe a visualization tool that can be used to view the change in
meaning of words over time. The tool makes use of existing (static) word
embedding datasets together with a timestamped $n$-gram corpus to create {\em
temporal} word embeddings.
