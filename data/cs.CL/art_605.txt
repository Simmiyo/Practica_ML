SYNTAGMA. A Linguistic Approach to Parsing
SYNTAGMA is a rule-based parsing system, structured on two levels: a general
parsing engine and a language specific grammar. The parsing engine is a
language independent program, while grammar and language specific rules and
resources are given as text files, consisting in a list of constituent
structuresand a lexical database with word sense related features and
constraints. Since its theoretical background is principally Tesniere's
Elements de syntaxe, SYNTAGMA's grammar emphasizes the role of argument
structure (valency) in constraint satisfaction, and allows also horizontal
bounds, for instance treating coordination. Notions such as Pro, traces, empty
categories are derived from Generative Grammar and some solutions are close to
Government&Binding Theory, although they are the result of an autonomous
research. These properties allow SYNTAGMA to manage complex syntactic
configurations and well known weak points in parsing engineering. An important
resource is the semantic network, which is used in disambiguation tasks.
Parsing process follows a bottom-up, rule driven strategy. Its behavior can be
controlled and fine-tuned.
