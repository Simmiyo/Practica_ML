HappyDB: A Corpus of 100,000 Crowdsourced Happy Moments
The science of happiness is an area of positive psychology concerned with
understanding what behaviors make people happy in a sustainable fashion.
Recently, there has been interest in developing technologies that help
incorporate the findings of the science of happiness into users' daily lives by
steering them towards behaviors that increase happiness. With the goal of
building technology that can understand how people express their happy moments
in text, we crowd-sourced HappyDB, a corpus of 100,000 happy moments that we
make publicly available. This paper describes HappyDB and its properties, and
outlines several important NLP problems that can be studied with the help of
the corpus. We also apply several state-of-the-art analysis techniques to
analyze HappyDB. Our results demonstrate the need for deeper NLP techniques to
be developed which makes HappyDB an exciting resource for follow-on research.
