Selectional Restrictions in HPSG
Selectional restrictions are semantic sortal constraints imposed on the
participants of linguistic constructions to capture contextually-dependent
constraints on interpretation. Despite their limitations, selectional
restrictions have proven very useful in natural language applications, where
they have been used frequently in word sense disambiguation, syntactic
disambiguation, and anaphora resolution. Given their practical value, we
explore two methods to incorporate selectional restrictions in the HPSG theory,
assuming that the reader is familiar with HPSG. The first method employs HPSG's
Background feature and a constraint-satisfaction component pipe-lined after the
parser. The second method uses subsorts of referential indices, and blocks
readings that violate selectional restrictions during parsing. While
theoretically less satisfactory, we have found the second method particularly
useful in the development of practical systems.
