Explorations in an English Poetry Corpus: A Neurocognitive Poetics
  Perspective
This paper describes a corpus of about 3000 English literary texts with about
250 million words extracted from the Gutenberg project that span a range of
genres from both fiction and non-fiction written by more than 130 authors
(e.g., Darwin, Dickens, Shakespeare). Quantitative Narrative Analysis (QNA) is
used to explore a cleaned subcorpus, the Gutenberg English Poetry Corpus (GEPC)
which comprises over 100 poetic texts with around 2 million words from about 50
authors (e.g., Keats, Joyce, Wordsworth). Some exemplary QNA studies show
author similarities based on latent semantic analysis, significant topics for
each author or various text-analytic metrics for George Eliot's poem 'How Lisa
Loved the King' and James Joyce's 'Chamber Music', concerning e.g. lexical
diversity or sentiment analysis. The GEPC is particularly suited for research
in Digital Humanities, Natural Language Processing or Neurocognitive Poetics,
e.g. as training and test corpus, or for stimulus development and control.
