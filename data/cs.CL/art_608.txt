Dealing with natural language interfaces in a geolocation context
In the geolocation field where high-level programs and low-level devices
coexist, it is often difficult to find a friendly user inter- face to configure
all the parameters. The challenge addressed in this paper is to propose
intuitive and simple, thus natural lan- guage interfaces to interact with
low-level devices. Such inter- faces contain natural language processing and
fuzzy represen- tations of words that facilitate the elicitation of
business-level objectives in our context.
