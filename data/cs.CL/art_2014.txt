Words, Concepts, and the Geometry of Analogy
This paper presents a geometric approach to the problem of modelling the
relationship between words and concepts, focusing in particular on analogical
phenomena in language and cognition. Grounded in recent theories regarding
geometric conceptual spaces, we begin with an analysis of existing static
distributional semantic models and move on to an exploration of a dynamic
approach to using high dimensional spaces of word meaning to project subspaces
where analogies can potentially be solved in an online, contextualised way. The
crucial element of this analysis is the positioning of statistics in a
geometric environment replete with opportunities for interpretation.
