Unknown Words Analysis in POS tagging of Sinhala Language
Part of Speech (POS) is a very vital topic in Natural Language Processing
(NLP) task in any language, which involves analysing the construction of the
language, behaviours and the dynamics of the language, the knowledge that could
be utilized in computational linguistics analysis and automation applications.
In this context, dealing with unknown words (words do not appear in the lexicon
referred as unknown words) is also an important task, since growing NLP systems
are used in more and more new applications. One aid of predicting lexical
categories of unknown words is the use of syntactical knowledge of the
language. The distinction between open class words and closed class words
together with syntactical features of the language used in this research to
predict lexical categories of unknown words in the tagging process. An
experiment is performed to investigate the ability of the approach to parse
unknown words using syntactical knowledge without human intervention. This
experiment shows that the performance of the tagging process is enhanced when
word class distinction is used together with syntactic rules to parse sentences
containing unknown words in Sinhala language.
