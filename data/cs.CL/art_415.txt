On Event Structure in the Torn Dress
Using Pustejovsky's "The Syntax of Event Structure" and Fong's "On Mending a
Torn Dress" we give a glimpse of a Pustejovsky-like analysis to some example
sentences in Fong. We attempt to give a framework for semantics to the noun
phrases and adverbs as appropriate as well as the lexical entries for all words
in the examples and critique both papers in light of our findings and
difficulties.
