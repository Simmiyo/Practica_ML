A Temporally Sensitive Submodularity Framework for Timeline
  Summarization
Timeline summarization (TLS) creates an overview of long-running events via
dated daily summaries for the most important dates. TLS differs from standard
multi-document summarization (MDS) in the importance of date selection,
interdependencies between summaries of different dates and by having very short
summaries compared to the number of corpus documents. However, we show that MDS
optimization models using submodular functions can be adapted to yield
well-performing TLS models by designing objective functions and constraints
that model the temporal dimension inherent in TLS. Importantly, these
adaptations retain the elegance and advantages of the original MDS models
(clear separation of features and inference, performance guarantees and
scalability, little need for supervision) that current TLS-specific models
lack. An open-source implementation of the framework and all models described
in this paper is available online.
