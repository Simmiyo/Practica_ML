Applying System Combination to Base Noun Phrase Identification
We use seven machine learning algorithms for one task: identifying base noun
phrases. The results have been processed by different system combination
methods and all of these outperformed the best individual result. We have
applied the seven learners with the best combinator, a majority vote of the top
five systems, to a standard data set and managed to improve the best published
result for this data set.
