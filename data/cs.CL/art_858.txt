Practice in Synonym Extraction at Large Scale
Synonym extraction is an important task in natural language processing and
often used as a submodule in query expansion, question answering and other
applications. Automatic synonym extractor is highly preferred for large scale
applications. Previous studies in synonym extraction are most limited to small
scale datasets. In this paper, we build a large dataset with 3.4 million
synonym/non-synonym pairs to capture the challenges in real world scenarios. We
proposed (1) a new cost function to accommodate the unbalanced learning
problem, and (2) a feature learning based deep neural network to model the
complicated relationships in synonym pairs. We compare several different
approaches based on SVMs and neural networks, and find out a novel feature
learning based neural network outperforms the methods with hand-assigned
features. Specifically, the best performance of our model surpasses the SVM
baseline with a significant 97\% relative improvement.
