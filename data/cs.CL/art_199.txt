Universal Model for Paraphrasing -- Using Transformation Based on a
  Defined Criteria --
This paper describes a universal model for paraphrasing that transforms
according to defined criteria. We showed that by using different criteria we
could construct different kinds of paraphrasing systems including one for
answering questions, one for compressing sentences, one for polishing up, and
one for transforming written language to spoken language.
