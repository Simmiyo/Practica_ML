BPEmb: Tokenization-free Pre-trained Subword Embeddings in 275 Languages
We present BPEmb, a collection of pre-trained subword unit embeddings in 275
languages, based on Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE). In an evaluation using
fine-grained entity typing as testbed, BPEmb performs competitively, and for
some languages bet- ter than alternative subword approaches, while requiring
vastly fewer resources and no tokenization. BPEmb is available at
