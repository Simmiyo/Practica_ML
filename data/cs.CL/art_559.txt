Recent Technological Advances in Natural Language Processing and
  Artificial Intelligence
A recent advance in computer technology has permitted scientists to implement
and test algorithms that were known from quite some time (or not) but which
were computationally expensive. Two such projects are IBM's Jeopardy as a part
of its DeepQA project [1] and Wolfram's Wolframalpha[2]. Both these methods
implement natural language processing (another goal of AI scientists) and try
to answer questions as asked by the user. Though the goal of the two projects
is similar, both of them have a different procedure at it's core. In the
following sections, the mechanism and history of IBM's Jeopardy and Wolfram
alpha has been explained followed by the implications of these projects in
realizing Ray Kurzweil's [3] dream of passing the Turing test by 2029. A recipe
of taking the above projects to a new level is also explained.
