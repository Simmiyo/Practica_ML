Collaborative Creation of Digital Content in Indian Languages
The world is passing through a major revolution called the information
revolution, in which information and knowledge is becoming available to people
in unprecedented amounts wherever and whenever they need it. Those societies
which fail to take advantage of the new technology will be left behind, just
like in the industrial revolution.
  The information revolution is based on two major technologies: computers and
communication. These technologies have to be delivered in a COST EFFECTIVE
manner, and in LANGUAGES accessible to people.
  One way to deliver them in cost effective manner is to make suitable
technology choices, and to allow people to access through shared resources.
This could be done throuch street corner shops (for computer usage, e-mail
etc.), schools, community centres and local library centres.
