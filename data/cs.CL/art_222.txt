Applying a Hybrid Query Translation Method to Japanese/English
  Cross-Language Patent Retrieval
This paper applies an existing query translation method to cross-language
patent retrieval. In our method, multiple dictionaries are used to derive all
possible translations for an input query, and collocational statistics are used
to resolve translation ambiguity. We used Japanese/English parallel patent
abstracts to perform comparative experiments, where our method outperformed a
simple dictionary-based query translation method, and achieved 76% of
monolingual retrieval in terms of average precision.
