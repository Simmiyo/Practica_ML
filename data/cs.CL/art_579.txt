TEI and LMF crosswalks
The present paper explores various arguments in favour of making the Text
Encoding Initia-tive (TEI) guidelines an appropriate serialisation for ISO
standard 24613:2008 (LMF, Lexi-cal Mark-up Framework) . It also identifies the
issues that would have to be resolved in order to reach an appropriate
implementation of these ideas, in particular in terms of infor-mational
coverage. We show how the customisation facilities offered by the TEI
guidelines can provide an adequate background, not only to cover missing
components within the current Dictionary chapter of the TEI guidelines, but
also to allow specific lexical projects to deal with local constraints. We
expect this proposal to be a basis for a future ISO project in the context of
the on going revision of LMF.
