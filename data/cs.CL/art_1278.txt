An Approach to Speed-up the Word Sense Disambiguation Procedure through
  Sense Filtering
In this paper, we are going to focus on speed up of the Word Sense
Disambiguation procedure by filtering the relevant senses of an ambiguous word
through Part-of-Speech Tagging. First, this proposed approach performs the
Part-of-Speech Tagging operation before the disambiguation procedure using
Bigram approximation. As a result, the exact Part-of-Speech of the ambiguous
word at a particular text instance is derived. In the next stage, only those
dictionary definitions (glosses) are retrieved from an online dictionary, which
are associated with that particular Part-of-Speech to disambiguate the exact
sense of the ambiguous word. In the training phase, we have used Brown Corpus
for Part-of-Speech Tagging and WordNet as an online dictionary. The proposed
approach reduces the execution time upto half (approximately) of the normal
execution time for a text, containing around 200 sentences. Not only that, we
have found several instances, where the correct sense of an ambiguous word is
found for using the Part-of-Speech Tagging before the Disambiguation procedure.
