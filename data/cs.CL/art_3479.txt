Path of Vowel Raising in Chengdu Dialect of Mandarin
He and Rao (2013) reported a raising phenomenon of /a/ in /Xan/ (X being a
consonant or a vowel) in Chengdu dialect of Mandarin, i.e. /a/ is realized as
[epsilon] for young speakers but [ae] for older speakers, but they offered no
acoustic analysis. We designed an acoustic study that examined the realization
of /Xan/ in speakers of different age (old vs. young) and gender (male vs.
female) groups, where X represents three conditions: 1) unaspirated consonants:
C ([p], [t], [k]), 2) aspirated consonants: Ch ([ph], [th], [kh]), and 3) high
vowels: V ([i], [y], [u]). 17 native speakers were asked to read /Xan/
characters and the F1 values are extracted for comparison. Our results
confirmed the raising effect in He and Rao (2013), i.e., young speakers realize
/a/ as [epsilon] in /an/, whereas older speakers in the most part realize it as
[ae]. Also, female speakers raise more than male speakers within the same age
group. Interestingly, within the /Van/ condition, older speakers do raise /a/
in /ian/ and /yan/. We interpret this as /a/ first assimilates to its preceding
front high vowels /i/ and /y/ for older speakers, which then becomes
phonologized in younger speakers in all conditions, including /Chan/ and /Can/.
This shows a possible trajectory of the ongoing sound change in the Chengdu
dialect.
