The Relevance of Text and Speech Features in Automatic Non-native
  English Accent Identification
This paper describes our experiments with automatically identifying native
accents from speech samples of non-native English speakers using low level
audio features, and n-gram features from manual transcriptions. Using a
publicly available non-native speech corpus and simple audio feature
representations that do not perform word/phoneme recognition, we show that it
is possible to achieve close to 90% classification accuracy for this task.
While character n-grams perform similar to speech features, we show that speech
features are not affected by prompt variation, whereas ngrams are. Since the
approach followed can be easily adapted to any language provided we have enough
training data, we believe these results will provide useful insights for the
development of accent recognition systems and for the study of accents in the
context of language learning.
