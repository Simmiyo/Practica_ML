Syllabification by Phone Categorization
Syllables play an important role in speech synthesis, speech recognition, and
spoken document retrieval. A novel, low cost, and language agnostic approach to
dividing words into their corresponding syllables is presented. A hybrid
genetic algorithm constructs a categorization of phones optimized for
syllabification. This categorization is used on top of a hidden Markov model
sequence classifier to find syllable boundaries. The technique shows promising
preliminary results when trained and tested on English words.
