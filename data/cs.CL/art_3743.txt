Commonsense mining as knowledge base completion? A study on the impact
  of novelty
Commonsense knowledge bases such as ConceptNet represent knowledge in the
form of relational triples. Inspired by the recent work by Li et al., we
analyse if knowledge base completion models can be used to mine commonsense
knowledge from raw text. We propose novelty of predicted triples with respect
to the training set as an important factor in interpreting results. We
critically analyse the difficulty of mining novel commonsense knowledge, and
show that a simple baseline method outperforms the previous state of the art on
predicting more novel.
