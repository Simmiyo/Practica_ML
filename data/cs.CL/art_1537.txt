Language Modeling for Code-Switched Data: Challenges and Approaches
Lately, the problem of code-switching has gained a lot of attention and has
emerged as an active area of research. In bilingual communities, the speakers
commonly embed the words and phrases of a non-native language into the syntax
of a native language in their day-to-day communications. The code-switching is
a global phenomenon among multilingual communities, still very limited acoustic
and linguistic resources are available as yet. For developing effective speech
based applications, the ability of the existing language technologies to deal
with the code-switched data can not be over emphasized. The code-switching is
broadly classified into two modes: inter-sentential and intra-sentential
code-switching. In this work, we have studied the intra-sentential problem in
the context of code-switching language modeling task. The salient contributions
of this paper includes: (i) the creation of Hindi-English code-switching text
corpus by crawling a few blogging sites educating about the usage of the
Internet (ii) the exploration of the parts-of-speech features towards more
effective modeling of Hindi-English code-switched data by the monolingual
language model (LM) trained on native (Hindi) language data, and (iii) the
proposal of a novel textual factor referred to as the code-switch factor
(CS-factor), which allows the LM to predict the code-switching instances. In
the context of recognition of the code-switching data, the substantial
reduction in the PPL is achieved with the use of POS factors and also the
proposed CS-factor provides independent as well as additive gain in the PPL.
