Detecting English Writing Styles For Non Native Speakers
This paper presents the first attempt, up to our knowledge, to classify
English writing styles on this scale with the challenge of classifying day to
day language written by writers with different backgrounds covering various
areas of topics.The paper proposes simple machine learning algorithms and
simple to generate features to solve hard problems. Relying on the scale of the
data available from large sources of knowledge like Wikipedia. We believe such
sources of data are crucial to generate robust solutions for the web with high
accuracy and easy to deploy in practice. The paper achieves 74\% accuracy
classifying native versus non native speakers writing styles.
  Moreover, the paper shows some interesting observations on the similarity
between different languages measured by the similarity of their users English
writing styles. This technique could be used to show some well known facts
about languages as in grouping them into families, which our experiments
support.
