Neural Reranking for Named Entity Recognition
We propose a neural reranking system for named entity recognition (NER). The
basic idea is to leverage recurrent neural network models to learn
sentence-level patterns that involve named entity mentions. In particular,
given an output sentence produced by a baseline NER model, we replace all
entity mentions, such as \textit{Barack Obama}, into their entity types, such
as \textit{PER}. The resulting sentence patterns contain direct output
information, yet is less sparse without specific named entities. For example,
"PER was born in LOC" can be such a pattern. LSTM and CNN structures are
utilised for learning deep representations of such sentences for reranking.
Results show that our system can significantly improve the NER accuracies over
two different baselines, giving the best reported results on a standard
benchmark.
