Multi-task memory networks for category-specific aspect and opinion
  terms co-extraction
In aspect-based sentiment analysis, most existing methods either focus on
aspect/opinion terms extraction or aspect terms categorization. However, each
task by itself only provides partial information to end users. To generate more
detailed and structured opinion analysis, we propose a finer-grained problem,
which we call category-specific aspect and opinion terms extraction. This
problem involves the identification of aspect and opinion terms within each
sentence, as well as the categorization of the identified terms. To this end,
we propose an end-to-end multi-task attention model, where each task
corresponds to aspect/opinion terms extraction for a specific category. Our
model benefits from exploring the commonalities and relationships among
different tasks to address the data sparsity issue. We demonstrate its
state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets.
