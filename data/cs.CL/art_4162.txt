Par4Sim -- Adaptive Paraphrasing for Text Simplification
Learning from a real-world data stream and continuously updating the model
without explicit supervision is a new challenge for NLP applications with
machine learning components. In this work, we have developed an adaptive
learning system for text simplification, which improves the underlying
learning-to-rank model from usage data, i.e. how users have employed the system
for the task of simplification. Our experimental result shows that, over a
period of time, the performance of the embedded paraphrase ranking model
increases steadily improving from a score of 62.88% up to 75.70% based on the
NDCG@10 evaluation metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first study where an
NLP component is adaptively improved through usage.
