Contextual Topic Modeling For Dialog Systems
Accurate prediction of conversation topics can be a valuable signal for
creating coherent and engaging dialog systems. In this work, we focus on
context-aware topic classification methods for identifying topics in free-form
human-chatbot dialogs. We extend previous work on neural topic classification
and unsupervised topic keyword detection by incorporating conversational
context and dialog act features. On annotated data, we show that incorporating
context and dialog acts leads to relative gains in topic classification
accuracy by 35% and on unsupervised keyword detection recall by 11% for
conversational interactions where topics frequently span multiple utterances.
We show that topical metrics such as topical depth is highly correlated with
dialog evaluation metrics such as coherence and engagement implying that
conversational topic models can predict user satisfaction. Our work for
detecting conversation topics and keywords can be used to guide chatbots
towards coherent dialog.
