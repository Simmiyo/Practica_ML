Dialogue Act Recognition via CRF-Attentive Structured Network
Dialogue Act Recognition (DAR) is a challenging problem in dialogue
interpretation, which aims to attach semantic labels to utterances and
characterize the speaker's intention. Currently, many existing approaches
formulate the DAR problem ranging from multi-classification to structured
prediction, which suffer from handcrafted feature extensions and attentive
contextual structural dependencies. In this paper, we consider the problem of
DAR from the viewpoint of extending richer Conditional Random Field (CRF)
structural dependencies without abandoning end-to-end training. We incorporate
hierarchical semantic inference with memory mechanism on the utterance
modeling. We then extend structured attention network to the linear-chain
conditional random field layer which takes into account both contextual
utterances and corresponding dialogue acts. The extensive experiments on two
major benchmark datasets Switchboard Dialogue Act (SWDA) and Meeting Recorder
Dialogue Act (MRDA) datasets show that our method achieves better performance
than other state-of-the-art solutions to the problem. It is a remarkable fact
that our method is nearly close to the human annotator's performance on SWDA
within 2% gap.
