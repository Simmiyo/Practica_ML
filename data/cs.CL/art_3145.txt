NoReC: The Norwegian Review Corpus
This paper presents the Norwegian Review Corpus (NoReC), created for training
and evaluating models for document-level sentiment analysis. The full-text
reviews have been collected from major Norwegian news sources and cover a range
of different domains, including literature, movies, video games, restaurants,
music and theater, in addition to product reviews across a range of categories.
Each review is labeled with a manually assigned score of 1-6, as provided by
the rating of the original author. This first release of the corpus comprises
more than 35,000 reviews. It is distributed using the CoNLL-U format,
pre-processed using UDPipe, along with a rich set of metadata. The work
reported in this paper forms part of the SANT initiative (Sentiment Analysis
for Norwegian Text), a project seeking to provide resources and tools for
sentiment analysis and opinion mining for Norwegian. As resources for sentiment
analysis have so far been unavailable for Norwegian, NoReC represents a highly
valuable and sought-after addition to Norwegian language technology.
