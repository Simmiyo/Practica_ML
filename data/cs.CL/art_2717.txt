A Critique of a Critique of Word Similarity Datasets: Sanity Check or
  Unnecessary Confusion?
Critical evaluation of word similarity datasets is very important for
computational lexical semantics. This short report concerns the sanity check
proposed in Batchkarov et al. (2016) to evaluate several popular datasets such
as MC, RG and MEN -- the first two reportedly failed. I argue that this test is
unstable, offers no added insight, and needs major revision in order to fulfill
its purported goal.
