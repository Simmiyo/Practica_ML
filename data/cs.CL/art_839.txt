On Detecting Noun-Adjective Agreement Errors in Bulgarian Language Using
  GATE
In this article, we describe an approach for automatic detection of
noun-adjective agreement errors in Bulgarian texts by explaining the necessary
steps required to develop a simple Java-based language processing application.
For this purpose, we use the GATE language processing framework, which is
capable of analyzing texts in Bulgarian language and can be embedded in
software applications, accessed through a set of Java APIs. In our example
application we also demonstrate how to use the functionality of GATE to perform
regular expressions over annotations for detecting agreement errors in simple
noun phrases formed by two words - attributive adjective and a noun, where the
attributive adjective precedes the noun. The provided code samples can also be
used as a starting point for implementing natural language processing
functionalities in software applications related to language processing tasks
like detection, annotation and retrieval of word groups meeting a specific set
of criteria.
