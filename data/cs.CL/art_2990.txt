Data-Driven Dialogue Systems for Social Agents
In order to build dialogue systems to tackle the ambitious task of holding
social conversations, we argue that we need a data driven approach that
includes insight into human conversational chit chat, and which incorporates
different natural language processing modules. Our strategy is to analyze and
index large corpora of social media data, including Twitter conversations,
online debates, dialogues between friends, and blog posts, and then to couple
this data retrieval with modules that perform tasks such as sentiment and style
analysis, topic modeling, and summarization. We aim for personal assistants
that can learn more nuanced human language, and to grow from task-oriented
agents to more personable social bots.
