An Attentive Sequence Model for Adverse Drug Event Extraction from
  Biomedical Text
Adverse reaction caused by drugs is a potentially dangerous problem which may
lead to mortality and morbidity in patients. Adverse Drug Event (ADE)
extraction is a significant problem in biomedical research. We model ADE
extraction as a Question-Answering problem and take inspiration from Machine
Reading Comprehension (MRC) literature, to design our model. Our objective in
designing such a model, is to exploit the local linguistic context in clinical
text and enable intra-sequence interaction, in order to jointly learn to
classify drug and disease entities, and to extract adverse reactions caused by
a given drug. Our model makes use of a self-attention mechanism to facilitate
intra-sequence interaction in a text sequence. This enables us to visualize and
understand how the network makes use of the local and wider context for
classification.
