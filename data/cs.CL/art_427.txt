Fuzzy Modeling and Natural Language Processing for Panini's Sanskrit
  Grammar
Indian languages have long history in World Natural languages. Panini was the
first to define Grammar for Sanskrit language with about 4000 rules in fifth
century. These rules contain uncertainty information. It is not possible to
Computer processing of Sanskrit language with uncertain information. In this
paper, fuzzy logic and fuzzy reasoning are proposed to deal to eliminate
uncertain information for reasoning with Sanskrit grammar. The Sanskrit
language processing is also discussed in this paper.
