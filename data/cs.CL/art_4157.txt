An empirical study on the names of points of interest and their changes
  with geographic distance
While Points Of Interest (POIs), such as restaurants, hotels, and barber
shops, are part of urban areas irrespective of their specific locations, the
names of these POIs often reveal valuable information related to local culture,
landmarks, influential families, figures, events, and so on. Place names have
long been studied by geographers, e.g., to understand their origins and
relations to family names. However, there is a lack of large-scale empirical
studies that examine the localness of place names and their changes with
geographic distance. In addition to enhancing our understanding of the
coherence of geographic regions, such empirical studies are also significant
for geographic information retrieval where they can inform computational models
and improve the accuracy of place name disambiguation. In this work, we conduct
an empirical study based on 112,071 POIs in seven US metropolitan areas
extracted from an open Yelp dataset. We propose to adopt term frequency and
inverse document frequency in geographic contexts to identify local terms used
in POI names and to analyze their usages across different POI types. Our
results show an uneven usage of local terms across POI types, which is highly
consistent among different geographic regions. We also examine the decaying
effect of POI name similarity with the increase of distance among POIs. While
our analysis focuses on urban POI names, the presented methods can be
generalized to other place types as well, such as mountain peaks and streets.
