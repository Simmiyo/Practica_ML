Identifying emergency stages in Facebook posts of police departments
  with convolutional and recurrent neural networks and support vector machines
Classification of social media posts in emergency response is an important
practical problem: accurate classification can help automate processing of such
messages and help other responders and the public react to emergencies in a
timely fashion. This research focused on classifying Facebook messages of US
police departments. Randomly selected 5,000 messages were used to train
classifiers that distinguished between four categories of messages: emergency
preparedness, response and recovery, as well as general engagement messages.
Features were represented with bag-of-words and word2vec, and models were
constructed using support vector machines (SVMs) and convolutional (CNNs) and
recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The best performing classifier was an RNN
with a custom-trained word2vec model to represent features, which achieved the
F1 measure of 0.839.
