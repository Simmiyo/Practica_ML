Question Answering in a Natural Language Understanding System Based on
  Object-Oriented Semantics
Algorithms of question answering in a computer system oriented on input and
logical processing of text information are presented. A knowledge domain under
consideration is social behavior of a person. A database of the system includes
an internal representation of natural language sentences and supplemental
information. The answer {\it Yes} or {\it No} is formed for a general question.
A special question containing an interrogative word or group of interrogative
words permits to find a subject, object, place, time, cause, purpose and way of
action or event. Answer generation is based on identification algorithms of
persons, organizations, machines, things, places, and times. Proposed
algorithms of question answering can be realized in information systems closely
connected with text processing (criminology, operation of business, medicine,
document systems).
