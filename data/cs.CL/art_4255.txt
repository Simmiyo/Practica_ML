Using Textual Summaries to Describe a Set of Products
When customers are faced with the task of making a purchase in an unfamiliar
product domain, it might be useful to provide them with an overview of the
product set to help them understand what they can expect. In this paper we
present and evaluate a method to summarise sets of products in natural
language, focusing on the price range, common product features across the set,
and product features that impact on price. In our study, participants reported
that they found our summaries useful, but we found no evidence that the
summaries influenced the selections made by participants.
