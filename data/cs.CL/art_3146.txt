Semi-Supervised Approach to Monitoring Clinical Depressive Symptoms in
  Social Media
With the rise of social media, millions of people are routinely expressing
their moods, feelings, and daily struggles with mental health issues on social
media platforms like Twitter. Unlike traditional observational cohort studies
conducted through questionnaires and self-reported surveys, we explore the
reliable detection of clinical depression from tweets obtained unobtrusively.
Based on the analysis of tweets crawled from users with self-reported
depressive symptoms in their Twitter profiles, we demonstrate the potential for
detecting clinical depression symptoms which emulate the PHQ-9 questionnaire
clinicians use today. Our study uses a semi-supervised statistical model to
evaluate how the duration of these symptoms and their expression on Twitter (in
terms of word usage patterns and topical preferences) align with the medical
findings reported via the PHQ-9. Our proactive and automatic screening tool is
able to identify clinical depressive symptoms with an accuracy of 68% and
precision of 72%.
