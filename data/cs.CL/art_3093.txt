Event Identification as a Decision Process with Non-linear
  Representation of Text
We propose scale-free Identifier Network(sfIN), a novel model for event
identification in documents. In general, sfIN first encodes a document into
multi-scale memory stacks, then extracts special events via conducting
multi-scale actions, which can be considered as a special type of sequence
labelling. The design of large scale actions makes it more efficient processing
a long document. The whole model is trained with both supervised learning and
reinforcement learning.
