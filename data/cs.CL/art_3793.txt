Various Approaches to Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis
The problem of aspect-based sentiment analysis deals with classifying
sentiments (negative, neutral, positive) for a given aspect in a sentence. A
traditional sentiment classification task involves treating the entire sentence
as a text document and classifying sentiments based on all the words. Let us
assume, we have a sentence such as "the acceleration of this car is fast, but
the reliability is horrible". This can be a difficult sentence because it has
two aspects with conflicting sentiments about the same entity. Considering
machine learning techniques (or deep learning), how do we encode the
information that we are interested in one aspect and its sentiment but not the
other? Let us explore various pre-processing steps, features, and methods used
to facilitate in solving this task.
