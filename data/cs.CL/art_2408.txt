Extending Automatic Discourse Segmentation for Texts in Spanish to
  Catalan
At present, automatic discourse analysis is a relevant research topic in the
field of NLP. However, discourse is one of the phenomena most difficult to
process. Although discourse parsers have been already developed for several
languages, this tool does not exist for Catalan. In order to implement this
kind of parser, the first step is to develop a discourse segmenter. In this
article we present the first discourse segmenter for texts in Catalan. This
segmenter is based on Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) for Spanish, and uses
lexical and syntactic information to translate rules valid for Spanish into
rules for Catalan. We have evaluated the system by using a gold standard corpus
including manually segmented texts and results are promising.
