Online Deception Detection Refueled by Real World Data Collection
The lack of large realistic datasets presents a bottleneck in online
deception detection studies. In this paper, we apply a data collection method
based on social network analysis to quickly identify high-quality deceptive and
truthful online reviews from Amazon. The dataset contains more than 10,000
deceptive reviews and is diverse in product domains and reviewers. Using this
dataset, we explore effective general features for online deception detection
that perform well across domains. We demonstrate that with generalized features
- advertising speak and writing complexity scores - deception detection
performance can be further improved by adding additional deceptive reviews from
assorted domains in training. Finally, reviewer level evaluation gives an
interesting insight into different deceptive reviewers' writing styles.
