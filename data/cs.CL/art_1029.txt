Labelling of user's utterances to understanding his attends which called
Dialogue Act (DA) classification, it is considered the key player for dialogue
language understanding layer in automatic dialogue systems. In this paper, we
proposed a novel approach to user's utterances labeling for Egyptian
spontaneous dialogues and Instant Messages using Machine Learning (ML) approach
without relying on any special lexicons, cues, or rules. Due to the lack of
Egyptian dialect dialogue corpus, the system evaluated by multi-genre corpus
includes 4725 utterances for three domains, which are collected and annotated
manually from Egyptian call-centers. The system achieves F1 scores of 70. 36%
overall domains.
