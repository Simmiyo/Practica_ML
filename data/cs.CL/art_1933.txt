Unsupervised Topic Modeling Approaches to Decision Summarization in
  Spoken Meetings
We present a token-level decision summarization framework that utilizes the
latent topic structures of utterances to identify "summary-worthy" words.
Concretely, a series of unsupervised topic models is explored and experimental
results show that fine-grained topic models, which discover topics at the
utterance-level rather than the document-level, can better identify the gist of
the decision-making process. Moreover, our proposed token-level summarization
approach, which is able to remove redundancies within utterances, outperforms
existing utterance ranking based summarization methods. Finally, context
information is also investigated to add additional relevant information to the
summary.
