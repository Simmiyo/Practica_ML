word. It also plays significant role in numerous application of Natural
Language Processing (NLP). The stemming problem has addressed in many contexts
and by researchers in many disciplines. This expository paper presents survey
of some of the latest developments on stemming algorithms in data mining and
also presents with some of the solutions for various Indian language stemming
algorithms along with the results.
