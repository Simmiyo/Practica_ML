A Nonparametric Bayesian Approach for Spoken Term detection by Example
  Query
State of the art speech recognition systems use data-intensive
context-dependent phonemes as acoustic units. However, these approaches do not
translate well to low resourced languages where large amounts of training data
is not available. For such languages, automatic discovery of acoustic units is
critical. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of nonparametric
Bayesian models to acoustic unit discovery. We show that the discovered units
are correlated with phonemes and therefore are linguistically meaningful. We
also present a spoken term detection (STD) by example query algorithm based on
these automatically learned units. We show that our proposed system produces a
P@N of 61.2% and an EER of 13.95% on the TIMIT dataset. The improvement in the
EER is 5% while P@N is only slightly lower than the best reported system in the
literature.
