Emotion Detection in Text: a Review
In recent years, emotion detection in text has become more popular due to its
vast potential applications in marketing, political science, psychology,
human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, etc. Access to a huge
amount of textual data, especially opinionated and self-expression text also
played a special role to bring attention to this field. In this paper, we
review the work that has been done in identifying emotion expressions in text
and argue that although many techniques, methodologies, and models have been
created to detect emotion in text, there are various reasons that make these
methods insufficient. Although, there is an essential need to improve the
design and architecture of current systems, factors such as the complexity of
human emotions, and the use of implicit and metaphorical language in expressing
it, lead us to think that just re-purposing standard methodologies will not be
enough to capture these complexities, and it is important to pay attention to
the linguistic intricacies of emotion expression.
