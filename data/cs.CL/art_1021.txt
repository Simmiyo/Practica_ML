A commentary on "The now-or-never bottleneck: a fundamental constraint
  on language", by Christiansen and Chater (2016)
In a recent article, Christiansen and Chater (2016) present a fundamental
constraint on language, i.e. a now-or-never bottleneck that arises from our
fleeting memory, and explore its implications, e.g., chunk-and-pass processing,
outlining a framework that promises to unify different areas of research. Here
we explore additional support for this constraint and suggest further
connections from quantitative linguistics and information theory.
