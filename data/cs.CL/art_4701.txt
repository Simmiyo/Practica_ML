Solving Sinhala Language Arithmetic Problems using Neural Networks
A methodology is presented to solve Arithmetic problems in Sinhala Language
using a Neural Network. The system comprises of (a) keyword identification, (b)
question identification, (c) mathematical operation identification and is
combined using a neural network. Naive Bayes Classification is used in order to
identify keywords and Conditional Random Field to identify the question and the
operation which should be performed on the identified keywords to achieve the
expected result. "One vs. all Classification" is done using a neural network
for sentences. All functions are combined through the neural network which
builds an equation to solve the problem. The paper compares each methodology in
ARIS and Mahoshadha to the method presented in the paper. Mahoshadha2 learns to
solve arithmetic problems with the accuracy of 76%.
