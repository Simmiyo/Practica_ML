Extracting Arabic Relations from the Web
The goal of this research is to extract a large list or table from named
entities and relations in a specific domain. A small set of a handful of
instance relations is required as input from the user. The system exploits
summaries from Google search engine as a source text. These instances are used
to extract patterns. The output is a set of new entities and their relations.
The results from four experiments show that precision and recall varies
according to relation type. Precision ranges from 0.61 to 0.75 while recall
ranges from 0.71 to 0.83. The best result is obtained for (player, club)
relationship, 0.72 and 0.83 for precision and recall respectively.
