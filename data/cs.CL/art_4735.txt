RumourEval 2019: Determining Rumour Veracity and Support for Rumours
This is the proposal for RumourEval-2019, which will run in early 2019 as
part of that year's SemEval event. Since the first RumourEval shared task in
2017, interest in automated claim validation has greatly increased, as the
dangers of "fake news" have become a mainstream concern. Yet automated support
for rumour checking remains in its infancy. For this reason, it is important
that a shared task in this area continues to provide a focus for effort, which
is likely to increase. We therefore propose a continuation in which the
veracity of further rumours is determined, and as previously, supportive of
this goal, tweets discussing them are classified according to the stance they
take regarding the rumour. Scope is extended compared with the first
RumourEval, in that the dataset is substantially expanded to include Reddit as
well as Twitter data, and additional languages are also included.
