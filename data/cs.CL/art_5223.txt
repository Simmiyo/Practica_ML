Sentiment Classification of Customer Reviews about Automobiles in Roman
  Urdu
Text mining is a broad field having sentiment mining as its important
constituent in which we try to deduce the behavior of people towards a specific
item, merchandise, politics, sports, social media comments, review sites etc.
Out of many issues in sentiment mining, analysis and classification, one major
issue is that the reviews and comments can be in different languages like
English, Arabic, Urdu etc. Handling each language according to its rules is a
difficult task. A lot of research work has been done in English Language for
sentiment analysis and classification but limited sentiment analysis work is
being carried out on other regional languages like Arabic, Urdu and Hindi. In
this paper, Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) is used as a
platform to execute different classification models for text classification of
Roman Urdu text. Reviews dataset has been scrapped from different automobiles
sites. These extracted Roman Urdu reviews, containing 1000 positive and 1000
negative reviews, are then saved in WEKA attribute-relation file format (arff)
as labeled examples. Training is done on 80% of this data and rest of it is
used for testing purpose which is done using different models and results are
analyzed in each case. The results show that Multinomial Naive Bayes
outperformed Bagging, Deep Neural Network, Decision Tree, Random Forest,
AdaBoost, k-NN and SVM Classifiers in terms of more accuracy, precision, recall
and F-measure.
