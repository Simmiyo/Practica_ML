Fusing Audio, Textual and Visual Features for Sentiment Analysis of News
  Videos
This paper presents a novel approach to perform sentiment analysis of news
videos, based on the fusion of audio, textual and visual clues extracted from
their contents. The proposed approach aims at contributing to the
semiodiscoursive study regarding the construction of the ethos (identity) of
this media universe, which has become a central part of the modern-day lives of
millions of people. To achieve this goal, we apply state-of-the-art
computational methods for (1) automatic emotion recognition from facial
expressions, (2) extraction of modulations in the participants' speeches and
(3) sentiment analysis from the closed caption associated to the videos of
interest. More specifically, we compute features, such as, visual intensities
of recognized emotions, field sizes of participants, voicing probability, sound
loudness, speech fundamental frequencies and the sentiment scores (polarities)
from text sentences in the closed caption. Experimental results with a dataset
containing 520 annotated news videos from three Brazilian and one American
popular TV newscasts show that our approach achieves an accuracy of up to 84%
in the sentiments (tension levels) classification task, thus demonstrating its
high potential to be used by media analysts in several applications,
especially, in the journalistic domain.
