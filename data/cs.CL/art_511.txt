Fault detection system for Arabic language
The study of natural language, especially Arabic, and mechanisms for the
implementation of automatic processing is a fascinating field of study, with
various potential applications. The importance of tools for natural language
processing is materialized by the need to have applications that can
effectively treat the vast mass of information available nowadays on electronic
forms. Among these tools, mainly driven by the necessity of a fast writing in
alignment to the actual daily life speed, our interest is on the writing
auditors. The morphological and syntactic properties of Arabic make it a
difficult language to master, and explain the lack in the processing tools for
that language. Among these properties, we can mention: the complex structure of
the Arabic word, the agglutinative nature, lack of vocalization, the
segmentation of the text, the linguistic richness, etc.
