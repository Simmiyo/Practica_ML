Concentric network symmetry grasps authors' styles in word adjacency
  networks
Several characteristics of written texts have been inferred from statistical
analysis derived from networked models. Even though many network measurements
have been adapted to study textual properties at several levels of complexity,
some textual aspects have been disregarded. In this paper, we study the
symmetry of word adjacency networks, a well-known representation of text as a
graph. A statistical analysis of the symmetry distribution performed in several
novels showed that most of the words do not display symmetric patterns of
connectivity. More specifically, the merged symmetry displayed a distribution
similar to the ubiquitous power-law distribution. Our experiments also revealed
that the studied metrics do not correlate with other traditional network
measurements, such as the degree or betweenness centrality. The effectiveness
of the symmetry measurements was verified in the authorship attribution task.
Interestingly, we found that specific authors prefer particular types of
symmetric motifs. As a consequence, the authorship of books could be accurately
identified in 82.5% of the cases, in a dataset comprising books written by 8
authors. Because the proposed measurements for text analysis are complementary
to the traditional approach, they can be used to improve the characterization
of text networks, which might be useful for related applications, such as those
relying on the identification of topical words and information retrieval.
