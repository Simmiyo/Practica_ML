Improved Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using Naive Bayes and Custom
  Language Model
In the last couple decades, social network services like Twitter have
generated large volumes of data about users and their interests, providing
meaningful business intelligence so organizations can better understand and
engage their customers. All businesses want to know who is promoting their
products, who is complaining about them, and how are these opinions bringing or
diminishing value to a company. Companies want to be able to identify their
high-value customers and quantify the value each user brings. Many businesses
use social media metrics to calculate the user contribution score, which
enables them to quantify the value that influential users bring on social
media, so the businesses can offer them more differentiated services. However,
the score calculation can be refined to provide a better illustration of a
user's contribution. Using Microsoft Azure as a case study, we conducted
Twitter sentiment analysis to develop a machine learning classification model
that identifies tweet contents and sentiments most illustrative of
positive-value user contribution. Using data mining and AI-powered cognitive
tools, we analyzed factors of social influence and specifically, promotional
language in the developer community. Our predictive model was a combination of
a traditional supervised machine learning algorithm and a custom-developed
natural language model for identifying promotional tweets, that identifies a
product-specific promotion on Twitter with a 90% accuracy rate.
