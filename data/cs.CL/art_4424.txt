Language Identification in Code-Mixed Data using Multichannel Neural
  Networks and Context Capture
An accurate language identification tool is an absolute necessity for
building complex NLP systems to be used on code-mixed data. Lot of work has
been recently done on the same, but there's still room for improvement.
Inspired from the recent advancements in neural network architectures for
computer vision tasks, we have implemented multichannel neural networks
combining CNN and LSTM for word level language identification of code-mixed
data. Combining this with a Bi-LSTM-CRF context capture module, accuracies of
93.28% and 93.32% is achieved on our two testing sets.
