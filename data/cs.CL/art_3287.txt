PronouncUR: An Urdu Pronunciation Lexicon Generator
State-of-the-art speech recognition systems rely heavily on three basic
components: an acoustic model, a pronunciation lexicon and a language model. To
build these components, a researcher needs linguistic as well as technical
expertise, which is a barrier in low-resource domains. Techniques to construct
these three components without having expert domain knowledge are in great
demand. Urdu, despite having millions of speakers all over the world, is a
low-resource language in terms of standard publically available linguistic
resources. In this paper, we present a grapheme-to-phoneme conversion tool for
Urdu that generates a pronunciation lexicon in a form suitable for use with
speech recognition systems from a list of Urdu words. The tool predicts the
pronunciation of words using a LSTM-based model trained on a handcrafted expert
lexicon of around 39,000 words and shows an accuracy of 64% upon internal
evaluation. For external evaluation on a speech recognition task, we obtain a
word error rate comparable to one achieved using a fully handcrafted expert
lexicon.
