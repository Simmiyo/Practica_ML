The 2015 Sheffield System for Transcription of Multi-Genre Broadcast
  Media
We describe the University of Sheffield system for participation in the 2015
Multi-Genre Broadcast (MGB) challenge task of transcribing multi-genre
broadcast shows. Transcription was one of four tasks proposed in the MGB
challenge, with the aim of advancing the state of the art of automatic speech
recognition, speaker diarisation and automatic alignment of subtitles for
broadcast media. Four topics are investigated in this work: Data selection
techniques for training with unreliable data, automatic speech segmentation of
broadcast media shows, acoustic modelling and adaptation in highly variable
environments, and language modelling of multi-genre shows. The final system
operates in multiple passes, using an initial unadapted decoding stage to
refine segmentation, followed by three adapted passes: a hybrid DNN pass with
input features normalised by speaker-based cepstral normalisation, another
hybrid stage with input features normalised by speaker feature-MLLR
transformations, and finally a bottleneck-based tandem stage with noise and
speaker factorisation. The combination of these three system outputs provides a
final error rate of 27.5% on the official development set, consisting of 47
multi-genre shows.
