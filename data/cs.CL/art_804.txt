Unsupervised Keyword Extraction from Polish Legal Texts
In this work, we present an application of the recently proposed unsupervised
keyword extraction algorithm RAKE to a corpus of Polish legal texts from the
field of public procurement. RAKE is essentially a language and domain
independent method. Its only language-specific input is a stoplist containing a
set of non-content words. The performance of the method heavily depends on the
choice of such a stoplist, which should be domain adopted. Therefore, we
complement RAKE algorithm with an automatic approach to selecting non-content
words, which is based on the statistical properties of term distribution.
