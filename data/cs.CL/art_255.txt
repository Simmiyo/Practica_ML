Parsing and Generation with Tabulation and Compilation
The standard tabulation techniques for logic programming presuppose fixed
order of computation. Some data-driven control should be introduced in order to
deal with diverse contexts. The present paper describes a data-driven method of
constraint transformation with a sort of compilation which subsumes
accessibility check and last-call optimization, which characterize standard
natural-language parsing techniques, semantic-head-driven generation, etc.
