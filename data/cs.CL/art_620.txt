"Not not bad" is not "bad": A distributional account of negation
With the increasing empirical success of distributional models of
compositional semantics, it is timely to consider the types of textual logic
that such models are capable of capturing. In this paper, we address
shortcomings in the ability of current models to capture logical operations
such as negation. As a solution we propose a tripartite formulation for a
continuous vector space representation of semantics and subsequently use this
representation to develop a formal compositional notion of negation within such
models.
