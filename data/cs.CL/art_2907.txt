ClaC: Semantic Relatedness of Words and Phrases
The measurement of phrasal semantic relatedness is an important metric for
many natural language processing applications. In this paper, we present three
approaches for measuring phrasal semantics, one based on a semantic network
model, another on a distributional similarity model, and a hybrid between the
two. Our hybrid approach achieved an F-measure of 77.4% on the task of
evaluating the semantic similarity of words and compositional phrases.
