Probabilistic Modelling of Morphologically Rich Languages
This thesis investigates how the sub-structure of words can be accounted for
in probabilistic models of language. Such models play an important role in
natural language processing tasks such as translation or speech recognition,
but often rely on the simplistic assumption that words are opaque symbols. This
assumption does not fit morphologically complex language well, where words can
have rich internal structure and sub-word elements are shared across distinct
word forms.
  Our approach is to encode basic notions of morphology into the assumptions of
three different types of language models, with the intention that leveraging
shared sub-word structure can improve model performance and help overcome data
sparsity that arises from morphological processes.
  In the context of n-gram language modelling, we formulate a new Bayesian
model that relies on the decomposition of compound words to attain better
smoothing, and we develop a new distributed language model that learns vector
representations of morphemes and leverages them to link together
morphologically related words. In both cases, we show that accounting for word
sub-structure improves the models' intrinsic performance and provides benefits
when applied to other tasks, including machine translation.
  We then shift the focus beyond the modelling of word sequences and consider
models that automatically learn what the sub-word elements of a given language
are, given an unannotated list of words. We formulate a novel model that can
learn discontiguous morphemes in addition to the more conventional contiguous
morphemes that most previous models are limited to. This approach is
demonstrated on Semitic languages, and we find that modelling discontiguous
sub-word structures leads to improvements in the task of segmenting words into
their contiguous morphemes.
