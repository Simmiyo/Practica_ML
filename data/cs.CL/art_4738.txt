Improving Moderation of Online Discussions via Interpretable Neural
  Models
Growing amount of comments make online discussions difficult to moderate by
human moderators only. Antisocial behavior is a common occurrence that often
discourages other users from participating in discussion. We propose a neural
network based method that partially automates the moderation process. It
consists of two steps. First, we detect inappropriate comments for moderators
to see. Second, we highlight inappropriate parts within these comments to make
the moderation faster. We evaluated our method on data from a major Slovak news
discussion platform.
