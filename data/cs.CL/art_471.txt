Using Inverse lambda and Generalization to Translate English to Formal
  Languages
We present a system to translate natural language sentences to formulas in a
formal or a knowledge representation language. Our system uses two inverse
lambda-calculus operators and using them can take as input the semantic
representation of some words, phrases and sentences and from that derive the
semantic representation of other words and phrases. Our inverse lambda operator
works on many formal languages including first order logic, database query
languages and answer set programming. Our system uses a syntactic combinatorial
categorial parser to parse natural language sentences and also to construct the
semantic meaning of the sentences as directed by their parsing. The same parser
is used for both. In addition to the inverse lambda-calculus operators, our
system uses a notion of generalization to learn semantic representation of
words from the semantic representation of other words that are of the same
category. Together with this, we use an existing statistical learning approach
to assign weights to deal with multiple meanings of words. Our system produces
improved results on standard corpora on natural language interfaces for robot
command and control and database queries.
