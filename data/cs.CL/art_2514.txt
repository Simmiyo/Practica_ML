A Broad-Coverage Challenge Corpus for Sentence Understanding through
  Inference
This paper introduces the Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MultiNLI)
corpus, a dataset designed for use in the development and evaluation of machine
learning models for sentence understanding. In addition to being one of the
largest corpora available for the task of NLI, at 433k examples, this corpus
improves upon available resources in its coverage: it offers data from ten
distinct genres of written and spoken English--making it possible to evaluate
systems on nearly the full complexity of the language--and it offers an
explicit setting for the evaluation of cross-genre domain adaptation.
