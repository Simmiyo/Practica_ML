Grounding Dynamic Spatial Relations for Embodied (Robot) Interaction
This paper presents a computational model of the processing of dynamic
spatial relations occurring in an embodied robotic interaction setup. A
complete system is introduced that allows autonomous robots to produce and
interpret dynamic spatial phrases (in English) given an environment of moving
objects. The model unites two separate research strands: computational
cognitive semantics and on commonsense spatial representation and reasoning.
The model for the first time demonstrates an integration of these different
strands.
