Story Cloze Ending Selection Baselines and Data Examination
This paper describes two supervised baseline systems for the Story Cloze Test
Shared Task (Mostafazadeh et al., 2016a). We first build a classifier using
features based on word embeddings and semantic similarity computation. We
further implement a neural LSTM system with different encoding strategies that
try to model the relation between the story and the provided endings. Our
experiments show that a model using representation features based on average
word embedding vectors over the given story words and the candidate ending
sentences words, joint with similarity features between the story and candidate
ending representations performed better than the neural models. Our best model
achieves an accuracy of 72.42, ranking 3rd in the official evaluation.
