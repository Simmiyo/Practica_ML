A System for Extracting Sentiment from Large-Scale Arabic Social Data
Social media data in Arabic language is becoming more and more abundant. It
is a consensus that valuable information lies in social media data. Mining this
data and making the process easier are gaining momentum in the industries. This
paper describes an enterprise system we developed for extracting sentiment from
large volumes of social data in Arabic dialects. First, we give an overview of
the Big Data system for information extraction from multilingual social data
from a variety of sources. Then, we focus on the Arabic sentiment analysis
capability that was built on top of the system including normalizing written
Arabic dialects, building sentiment lexicons, sentiment classification, and
performance evaluation. Lastly, we demonstrate the value of enriching sentiment
results with user profiles in understanding sentiments of a specific user
group.
