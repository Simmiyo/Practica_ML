Rule Based Stemmer in Urdu
Urdu is a combination of several languages like Arabic, Hindi, English,
Turkish, Sanskrit etc. It has a complex and rich morphology. This is the reason
why not much work has been done in Urdu language processing. Stemming is used
to convert a word into its respective root form. In stemming, we separate the
suffix and prefix from the word. It is useful in search engines, natural
language processing and word processing, spell checkers, word parsing, word
frequency and count studies. This paper presents a rule based stemmer for Urdu.
The stemmer that we have discussed here is used in information retrieval. We
have also evaluated our results by verifying it with a human expert.
