Issues in Communication Game
As interaction between autonomous agents, communication can be analyzed in
game-theoretic terms. Meaning game is proposed to formalize the core of
intended communication in which the sender sends a message and the receiver
attempts to infer its meaning intended by the sender. Basic issues involved in
the game of natural language communication are discussed, such as salience,
grammaticality, common sense, and common belief, together with some
demonstration of the feasibility of game-theoretic account of language.
