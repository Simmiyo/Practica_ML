Lexical Resources for Hindi Marathi MT
In this paper we describe some ways to utilize various lexical resources to
improve the quality of statistical machine translation system. We have
augmented the training corpus with various lexical resources such as
IndoWordnet semantic relation set, function words, kridanta pairs and verb
phrases etc. Our research on the usage of lexical resources mainly focused on
two ways such as augmenting parallel corpus with more vocabulary and augmenting
with various word forms. We have described case studies, evaluations and
detailed error analysis for both Marathi to Hindi and Hindi to Marathi machine
translation systems. From the evaluations we observed that, there is an
incremental growth in the quality of machine translation as the usage of
various lexical resources increases. Moreover usage of various lexical
resources helps to improve the coverage and quality of machine translation
where limited parallel corpus is available.
