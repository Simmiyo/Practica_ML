A Novel ILP Framework for Summarizing Content with High Lexical Variety
Summarizing content contributed by individuals can be challenging, because
people make different lexical choices even when describing the same events.
However, there remains a significant need to summarize such content. Examples
include the student responses to post-class reflective questions, product
reviews, and news articles published by different news agencies related to the
same events. High lexical diversity of these documents hinders the system's
ability to effectively identify salient content and reduce summary redundancy.
In this paper, we overcome this issue by introducing an integer linear
programming-based summarization framework. It incorporates a low-rank
approximation to the sentence-word co-occurrence matrix to intrinsically group
semantically-similar lexical items. We conduct extensive experiments on
datasets of student responses, product reviews, and news documents. Our
approach compares favorably to a number of extractive baselines as well as a
neural abstractive summarization system. The paper finally sheds light on when
and why the proposed framework is effective at summarizing content with high
lexical variety.
