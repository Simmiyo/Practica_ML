Considering a resource-light approach to learning verb valencies
Here we describe work on learning the subcategories of verbs in a
morphologically rich language using only minimal linguistic resources. Our goal
is to learn verb subcategorizations for Quechua, an under-resourced
morphologically rich language, from an unannotated corpus. We compare results
from applying this approach to an unannotated Arabic corpus with those achieved
by processing the same text in treebank form. The original plan was to use only
a morphological analyzer and an unannotated corpus, but experiments suggest
that this approach by itself will not be effective for learning the
combinatorial potential of Arabic verbs in general. The lower bound on
resources for acquiring this information is somewhat higher, apparently
requiring a a part-of-speech tagger and chunker for most languages, and a
morphological disambiguater for Arabic.
