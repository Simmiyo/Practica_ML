Character-based Joint Segmentation and POS Tagging for Chinese using
  Bidirectional RNN-CRF
We present a character-based model for joint segmentation and POS tagging for
Chinese. The bidirectional RNN-CRF architecture for general sequence tagging is
adapted and applied with novel vector representations of Chinese characters
that capture rich contextual information and lower-than-character level
features. The proposed model is extensively evaluated and compared with a
state-of-the-art tagger respectively on CTB5, CTB9 and UD Chinese. The
experimental results indicate that our model is accurate and robust across
datasets in different sizes, genres and annotation schemes. We obtain
state-of-the-art performance on CTB5, achieving 94.38 F1-score for joint
segmentation and POS tagging.
