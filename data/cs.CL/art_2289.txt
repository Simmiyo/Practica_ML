DNN adaptation by automatic quality estimation of ASR hypotheses
In this paper we propose to exploit the automatic Quality Estimation (QE) of
ASR hypotheses to perform the unsupervised adaptation of a deep neural network
modeling acoustic probabilities. Our hypothesis is that significant
improvements can be achieved by: i)automatically transcribing the evaluation
data we are currently trying to recognise, and ii) selecting from it a subset
of "good quality" instances based on the word error rate (WER) scores predicted
by a QE component. To validate this hypothesis, we run several experiments on
the evaluation data sets released for the CHiME-3 challenge. First, we operate
in oracle conditions in which manual transcriptions of the evaluation data are
available, thus allowing us to compute the "true" sentence WER. In this
scenario, we perform the adaptation with variable amounts of data, which are
characterised by different levels of quality. Then, we move to realistic
conditions in which the manual transcriptions of the evaluation data are not
available. In this case, the adaptation is performed on data selected according
to the WER scores "predicted" by a QE component. Our results indicate that: i)
QE predictions allow us to closely approximate the adaptation results obtained
in oracle conditions, and ii) the overall ASR performance based on the proposed
QE-driven adaptation method is significantly better than the strong, most
recent, CHiME-3 baseline.
