Reordering rules for English-Hindi SMT
Reordering is a preprocessing stage for Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)
system where the words of the source sentence are reordered as per the syntax
of the target language. We are proposing a rich set of rules for better
reordering. The idea is to facilitate the training process by better alignments
and parallel phrase extraction for a phrase-based SMT system. Reordering also
helps the decoding process and hence improving the machine translation quality.
We have observed significant improvements in the translation quality by using
our approach over the baseline SMT. We have used BLEU, NIST, multi-reference
word error rate, multi-reference position independent error rate for judging
the improvements. We have exploited open source SMT toolkit MOSES to develop
the system.
