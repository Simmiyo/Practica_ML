Luminoso at SemEval-2018 Task 10: Distinguishing Attributes Using Text
  Corpora and Relational Knowledge
Luminoso participated in the SemEval 2018 task on "Capturing Discriminative
Attributes" with a system based on ConceptNet, an open knowledge graph focused
on general knowledge. In this paper, we describe how we trained a linear
classifier on a small number of semantically-informed features to achieve an
$F_1$ score of 0.7368 on the task, close to the task's high score of 0.75.
