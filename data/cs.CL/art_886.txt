Survey:Natural Language Parsing For Indian Languages
Syntactic parsing is a necessary task which is required for NLP applications
including machine translation. It is a challenging task to develop a
qualitative parser for morphological rich and agglutinative languages.
Syntactic analysis is used to understand the grammatical structure of a natural
language sentence. It outputs all the grammatical information of each word and
its constituent. Also issues related to it help us to understand the language
in a more detailed way. This literature survey is groundwork to understand the
different parser development for Indian languages and various approaches that
are used to develop such tools and techniques. This paper provides a survey of
research papers from well known journals and conferences.
