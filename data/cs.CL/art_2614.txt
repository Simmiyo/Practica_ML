A Survey of Deep Learning Methods for Relation Extraction
Relation Extraction is an important sub-task of Information Extraction which
has the potential of employing deep learning (DL) models with the creation of
large datasets using distant supervision. In this review, we compare the
contributions and pitfalls of the various DL models that have been used for the
task, to help guide the path ahead.
