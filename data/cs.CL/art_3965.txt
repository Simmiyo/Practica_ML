UMDuluth-CS8761 at SemEval-2018 Task 9: Hypernym Discovery using Hearst
  Patterns, Co-occurrence frequencies and Word Embeddings
Hypernym Discovery is the task of identifying potential hypernyms for a given
term. A hypernym is a more generalized word that is super-ordinate to more
specific words. This paper explores several approaches that rely on
co-occurrence frequencies of word pairs, Hearst Patterns based on regular
expressions, and word embeddings created from the UMBC corpus. Our system
Babbage participated in Subtask 1A for English and placed 6th of 19 systems
when identifying concept hypernyms, and 12th of 18 systems for entity
hypernyms.
