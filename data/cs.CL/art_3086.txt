A Crowd-Annotated Spanish Corpus for Humor Analysis
Computational Humor involves several tasks, such as humor recognition, humor
generation, and humor scoring, for which it is useful to have human-curated
data. In this work we present a corpus of 27,000 tweets written in Spanish and
crowd-annotated by their humor value and funniness score, with about four
annotations per tweet, tagged by 1,300 people over the Internet. It is equally
divided between tweets coming from humorous and non-humorous accounts. The
inter-annotator agreement Krippendorff's alpha value is 0.5710. The dataset is
available for general use and can serve as a basis for humor detection and as a
first step to tackle subjectivity.
