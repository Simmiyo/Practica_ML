Microtask crowdsourcing for disease mention annotation in PubMed
  abstracts
Identifying concepts and relationships in biomedical text enables knowledge
to be applied in computational analyses. Many biological natural language
process (BioNLP) projects attempt to address this challenge, but the state of
the art in BioNLP still leaves much room for improvement. Progress in BioNLP
research depends on large, annotated corpora for evaluating information
extraction systems and training machine learning models. Traditionally, such
corpora are created by small numbers of expert annotators often working over
extended periods of time. Recent studies have shown that workers on microtask
crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk (AMT) can, in
aggregate, generate high-quality annotations of biomedical text. Here, we
investigated the use of the AMT in capturing disease mentions in PubMed
abstracts. We used the NCBI Disease corpus as a gold standard for refining and
benchmarking our crowdsourcing protocol. After several iterations, we arrived
at a protocol that reproduced the annotations of the 593 documents in the
training set of this gold standard with an overall F measure of 0.872
(precision 0.862, recall 0.883). The output can also be tuned to optimize for
precision (max = 0.984 when recall = 0.269) or recall (max = 0.980 when
precision = 0.436). Each document was examined by 15 workers, and their
annotations were merged based on a simple voting method. In total 145 workers
combined to complete all 593 documents in the span of 1 week at a cost of $.06
per abstract per worker. The quality of the annotations, as judged with the F
measure, increases with the number of workers assigned to each task such that
the system can be tuned to balance cost against quality. These results
demonstrate that microtask crowdsourcing can be a valuable tool for generating
well-annotated corpora in BioNLP.
