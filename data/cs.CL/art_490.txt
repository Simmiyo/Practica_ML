Construction du lexique LGLex à partir des tables du Lexique-Grammaire
  des verbes du grec moderne
In this paper, we summerize the work done on the resources of Modern Greek on
the Lexicon-Grammar of verbs. We detail the definitional features of each
table, and all changes made to the names of features to make them consistent.
Through the development of the table of classes, including all the features, we
have considered the conversion of tables in a syntactic lexicon: LGLex. The
lexicon, in plain text format or XML, is generated by the LGExtract tool
(Constant & Tolone, 2010). This format is directly usable in applications of
Natural Language Processing (NLP).
