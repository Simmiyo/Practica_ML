Bianet: A Parallel News Corpus in Turkish, Kurdish and English
We present a new open-source parallel corpus consisting of news articles
collected from the Bianet magazine, an online newspaper that publishes Turkish
news, often along with their translations in English and Kurdish. In this
paper, we describe the collection process of the corpus and its statistical
properties. We validate the benefit of using the Bianet corpus by evaluating
bilingual and multilingual neural machine translation models in English-Turkish
and English-Kurdish directions.
