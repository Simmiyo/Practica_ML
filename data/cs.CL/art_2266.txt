Emotion Recognition From Speech With Recurrent Neural Networks
In this paper the task of emotion recognition from speech is considered.
Proposed approach uses deep recurrent neural network trained on a sequence of
acoustic features calculated over small speech intervals. At the same time
special probabilistic-nature CTC loss function allows to consider long
utterances containing both emotional and neutral parts. The effectiveness of
such an approach is shown in two ways. Firstly, the comparison with recent
advances in this field is carried out. Secondly, human performance on the same
task is measured. Both criteria show the high quality of the proposed method.
