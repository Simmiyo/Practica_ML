Semi-Supervised Affective Meaning Lexicon Expansion Using Semantic and
  Distributed Word Representations
In this paper, we propose an extension to graph-based sentiment lexicon
induction methods by incorporating distributed and semantic word
representations in building the similarity graph to expand a three-dimensional
sentiment lexicon. We also implemented and evaluated the label propagation
using four different word representations and similarity metrics. Our
comprehensive evaluation of the four approaches was performed on a single data
set, demonstrating that all four methods can generate a significant number of
new sentiment assignments with high accuracy. The highest correlations
(tau=0.51) and the lowest error (mean absolute error < 1.1%), obtained by
combining both the semantic and the distributional features, outperformed the
distributional-based and semantic-based label-propagation models and approached
a supervised algorithm.
