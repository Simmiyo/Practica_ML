An electronic dictionary as a basis for NLP tools: The Greek case
The existence of a Dictionary in electronic form for Modern Greek (MG) is
mandatory if one is to process MG at the morphological and syntactic levels
since MG is a highly inflectional language with marked stress and a spelling
system with many characteristics carried over from Ancient Greek. Moreover,
such a tool becomes necessary if one is to create efficient and sophisticated
NLP applications with substantial linguistic backing and coverage. The present
paper will focus on the deployment of such an electronic dictionary for Modern
Greek, which was built in two phases: first it was constructed to be the basis
for a spelling correction schema and then it was reconstructed in order to
become the platform for the deployment of a wider spectrum of NLP tools.
