KS_JU@DPIL-FIRE2016:Detecting Paraphrases in Indian Languages Using
  Multinomial Logistic Regression Model
In this work, we describe a system that detects paraphrases in Indian
Languages as part of our participation in the shared Task on detecting
paraphrases in Indian Languages (DPIL) organized by Forum for Information
Retrieval Evaluation (FIRE) in 2016. Our paraphrase detection method uses a
multinomial logistic regression model trained with a variety of features which
are basically lexical and semantic level similarities between two sentences in
a pair. The performance of the system has been evaluated against the test set
released for the FIRE 2016 shared task on DPIL. Our system achieves the highest
f-measure of 0.95 on task1 in Punjabi language.The performance of our system on
task1 in Hindi language is f-measure of 0.90. Out of 11 teams participated in
the shared task, only four teams participated in all four languages, Hindi,
Punjabi, Malayalam and Tamil, but the remaining 7 teams participated in one of
the four languages. We also participated in task1 and task2 both for all four
Indian Languages. The overall average performance of our system including task1
and task2 overall four languages is F1-score of 0.81 which is the second
highest score among the four systems that participated in all four languages.
