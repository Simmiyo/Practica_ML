Sign Language Gibberish for syntactic parsing evaluation
Sign Language (SL) automatic processing slowly progresses bottom-up. The
field has seen proposition to handle the video signal, to recognize and
synthesize sublexical and lexical units. It starts to see the development of
supra-lexical processing. But the recognition, at this level, lacks data. The
syntax of SL appears very specific as it uses massively the multiplicity of
articulators and its access to the spatial dimensions. Therefore new parsing
techniques are developed. However these need to be evaluated. The shortage on
real data restrains the corpus-based models to small sizes. We propose here a
solution to produce data-sets for the evaluation of parsers on the specific
properties of SL. The article first describes the general model used to
generates dependency grammars and the phrase generation from these lasts. It
then discusses the limits of approach. The solution shows to be of particular
interest to evaluate the scalability of the techniques on big models.
