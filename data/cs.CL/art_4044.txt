Understanding Meanings in Multilingual Customer Feedback
Understanding and being able to react to customer feedback is the most
fundamental task in providing good customer service. However, there are two
major obstacles for international companies to automatically detect the meaning
of customer feedback in a global multilingual environment. Firstly, there is no
widely acknowledged categorisation (classes) of meaning for customer feedback.
Secondly, the applicability of one meaning categorisation, if it exists, to
customer feedback in multiple languages is questionable. In this paper, we
extracted representative real world samples of customer feedback from Microsoft
Office customers in multiple languages, English, Spanish and Japanese,and
concluded a five-class categorisation(comment, request, bug, complaint and
meaningless) for meaning classification that could be used across languages in
the realm of customer feedback analysis.
