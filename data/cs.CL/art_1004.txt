Supervised Hierarchical Classification for Student Answer Scoring
This paper describes a hierarchical system that predicts one label at a time
for automated student response analysis. For the task, we build a
classification binary tree that delays more easily confused labels to later
stages using hierarchical processes. In particular, the paper describes how the
hierarchical classifier has been built and how the classification task has been
broken down into binary subtasks. It finally discusses the motivations and
fundamentals of such an approach.
