Authorship attribution via network motifs identification
Concepts and methods of complex networks can be used to analyse texts at
their different complexity levels. Examples of natural language processing
(NLP) tasks studied via topological analysis of networks are keyword
identification, automatic extractive summarization and authorship attribution.
Even though a myriad of network measurements have been applied to study the
authorship attribution problem, the use of motifs for text analysis has been
restricted to a few works. The goal of this paper is to apply the concept of
motifs, recurrent interconnection patterns, in the authorship attribution task.
The absolute frequencies of all thirteen directed motifs with three nodes were
extracted from the co-occurrence networks and used as classification features.
The effectiveness of these features was verified with four machine learning
methods. The results show that motifs are able to distinguish the writing style
of different authors. In our best scenario, 57.5% of the books were correctly
classified. The chance baseline for this problem is 12.5%. In addition, we have
found that function words play an important role in these recurrent patterns.
Taken together, our findings suggest that motifs should be further explored in
other related linguistic tasks.
