An Empirical Comparison of Parsing Methods for Stanford Dependencies
Stanford typed dependencies are a widely desired representation of natural
language sentences, but parsing is one of the major computational bottlenecks
in text analysis systems. In light of the evolving definition of the Stanford
dependencies and developments in statistical dependency parsing algorithms,
this paper revisits the question of Cer et al. (2010): what is the tradeoff
between accuracy and speed in obtaining Stanford dependencies in particular? We
also explore the effects of input representations on this tradeoff:
part-of-speech tags, the novel use of an alternative dependency representation
as input, and distributional representaions of words. We find that direct
dependency parsing is a more viable solution than it was found to be in the
past. An accompanying software release can be found at:
