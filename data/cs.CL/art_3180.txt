Clickbait Identification using Neural Networks
This paper presents the results of our participation in the Clickbait
Detection Challenge 2017. The system relies on a fusion of neural networks,
incorporating different types of available informations. It does not require
any linguistic preprocessing, and hence generalizes more easily to new domains
and languages. The final combined model achieves a mean squared error of
0.0428, an accuracy of 0.826, and a F1 score of 0.564. According to the
official evaluation metric the system ranked 6th of the 13 participating teams.
