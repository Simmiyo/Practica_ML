Using Syntactic Features for Phishing Detection
This paper reports on the comparison of the subject and object of verbs in
their usage between phishing emails and legitimate emails. The purpose of this
research is to explore whether the syntactic structures and subjects and
objects of verbs can be distinguishable features for phishing detection. To
achieve the objective, we have conducted two series of experiments: the
syntactic similarity for sentences, and the subject and object of verb
comparison. The results of the experiments indicated that both features can be
used for some verbs, but more work has to be done for others.
