Type Arithmetics: Computation based on the theory of types
The present paper shows meta-programming turn programming, which is rich
enough to express arbitrary arithmetic computations. We demonstrate a type
system that implements Peano arithmetics, slightly generalized to negative
numbers. Certain types in this system denote numerals. Arithmetic operations on
such types-numerals - addition, subtraction, and even division - are expressed
as type reduction rules executed by a compiler. A remarkable trait is that
division by zero becomes a type error - and reported as such by a compiler.
