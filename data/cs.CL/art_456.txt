Computational Approach to Anaphora Resolution in Spanish Dialogues
This paper presents an algorithm for identifying noun-phrase antecedents of
pronouns and adjectival anaphors in Spanish dialogues. We believe that anaphora
resolution requires numerous sources of information in order to find the
correct antecedent of the anaphor. These sources can be of different kinds,
e.g., linguistic information, discourse/dialogue structure information, or
topic information. For this reason, our algorithm uses various different kinds
of information (hybrid information). The algorithm is based on linguistic
constraints and preferences and uses an anaphoric accessibility space within
which the algorithm finds the noun phrase. We present some experiments related
to this algorithm and this space using a corpus of 204 dialogues. The algorithm
is implemented in Prolog. According to this study, 95.9% of antecedents were
located in the proposed space, a precision of 81.3% was obtained for pronominal
anaphora resolution, and 81.5% for adjectival anaphora.
