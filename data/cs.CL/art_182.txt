Classes for Fast Maximum Entropy Training
Maximum entropy models are considered by many to be one of the most promising
avenues of language modeling research. Unfortunately, long training times make
maximum entropy research difficult. We present a novel speedup technique: we
change the form of the model to use classes. Our speedup works by creating two
maximum entropy models, the first of which predicts the class of each word, and
the second of which predicts the word itself. This factoring of the model leads
to fewer non-zero indicator functions, and faster normalization, achieving
speedups of up to a factor of 35 over one of the best previous techniques. It
also results in typically slightly lower perplexities. The same trick can be
used to speed training of other machine learning techniques, e.g. neural
networks, applied to any problem with a large number of outputs, such as
language modeling.
