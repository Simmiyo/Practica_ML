Serialising the ISO SynAF Syntactic Object Model
This paper introduces, an XML format developed to serialise the object model
defined by the ISO Syntactic Annotation Framework SynAF. Based on widespread
best practices we adapt a popular XML format for syntactic annotation,
TigerXML, with additional features to support a variety of syntactic phenomena
including constituent and dependency structures, binding, and different node
types such as compounds or empty elements. We also define interfaces to other
formats and standards including the Morpho-syntactic Annotation Framework MAF
and the ISOCat Data Category Registry. Finally a case study of the German
Treebank TueBa-D/Z is presented, showcasing the handling of constituent
structures, topological fields and coreference annotation in tandem.
