A toolkit for a generative lexicon
In this paper we describe the conception of a software toolkit designed for
the construction, maintenance and collaborative use of a Generative Lexicon. In
order to ease its portability and spreading use, this tool was built with free
and open source products. We eventually tested the toolkit and showed it
filters the adequate form of anaphoric reference to the modifier in endocentric
compounds.
