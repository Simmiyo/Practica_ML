A Morphological Analyzer for Japanese Nouns, Verbs and Adjectives
We present an open source morphological analyzer for Japanese nouns, verbs
and adjectives. The system builds upon the morphological analyzing capabilities
of MeCab to incorporate finer details of classification such as politeness,
tense, mood and voice attributes. We implemented our analyzer in the form of a
finite state transducer using the open source finite state compiler FOMA
toolkit. The source code and tool is available at
