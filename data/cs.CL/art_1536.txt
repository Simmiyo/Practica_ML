Tracking of enriched dialog states for flexible conversational
  information access
Dialog state tracking (DST) is a crucial component in a task-oriented dialog
system for conversational information access. A common practice in current
dialog systems is to define the dialog state by a set of slot-value pairs. Such
representation of dialog states and the slot-filling based DST have been widely
employed, but suffer from three drawbacks. (1) The dialog state can contain
only a single value for a slot, and (2) can contain only users' affirmative
preference over the values for a slot. (3) Current task-based dialog systems
mainly focus on the searching task, while the enquiring task is also very
common in practice. The above observations motivate us to enrich current
representation of dialog states and collect a brand new dialog dataset about
movies, based upon which we build a new DST, called enriched DST (EDST), for
flexible accessing movie information. The EDST supports the searching task, the
enquiring task and their mixed task. We show that the new EDST method not only
achieves good results on Iqiyi dataset, but also outperforms other
state-of-the-art DST methods on the traditional dialog datasets, WOZ2.0 and
DSTC2.
