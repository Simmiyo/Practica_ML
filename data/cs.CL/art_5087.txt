Hate Speech Detection from Code-mixed Hindi-English Tweets Using Deep
  Learning Models
This paper reports an increment to the state-of-the-art in hate speech
detection for English-Hindi code-mixed tweets. We compare three typical deep
learning models using domain-specific embeddings. On experimenting with a
benchmark dataset of English-Hindi code-mixed tweets, we observe that using
domain-specific embeddings results in an improved representation of target
groups, and an improved F-score.
