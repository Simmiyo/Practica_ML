A Semantic Relatedness Measure Based on Combined Encyclopedic,
  Ontological and Collocational Knowledge
We describe a new semantic relatedness measure combining the Wikipedia-based
Explicit Semantic Analysis measure, the WordNet path measure and the mixed
collocation index. Our measure achieves the currently highest results on the
WS-353 test: a Spearman rho coefficient of 0.79 (vs. 0.75 in (Gabrilovich and
Markovitch, 2007)) when applying the measure directly, and a value of 0.87 (vs.
0.78 in (Agirre et al., 2009)) when using the prediction of a polynomial SVM
classifier trained on our measure.
  In the appendix we discuss the adaptation of ESA to 2011 Wikipedia data, as
well as various unsuccessful attempts to enhance ESA by filtering at word,
sentence, and section level.
