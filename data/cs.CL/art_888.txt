INRIASAC: Simple Hypernym Extraction Methods
Given a set of terms from a given domain, how can we structure them into a
taxonomy without manual intervention? This is the task 17 of SemEval 2015. Here
we present our simple taxonomy structuring techniques which, despite their
simplicity, ranked first in this 2015 benchmark. We use large quantities of
text (English Wikipedia) and simple heuristics such as term overlap and
document and sentence co-occurrence to produce hypernym lists. We describe
these techniques and pre-sent an initial evaluation of results.
