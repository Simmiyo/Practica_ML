Data-driven Summarization of Scientific Articles
Data-driven approaches to sequence-to-sequence modelling have been
successfully applied to short text summarization of news articles. Such models
are typically trained on input-summary pairs consisting of only a single or a
few sentences, partially due to limited availability of multi-sentence training
data. Here, we propose to use scientific articles as a new milestone for text
summarization: large-scale training data come almost for free with two types of
high-quality summaries at different levels - the title and the abstract. We
generate two novel multi-sentence summarization datasets from scientific
articles and test the suitability of a wide range of existing extractive and
abstractive neural network-based summarization approaches. Our analysis
demonstrates that scientific papers are suitable for data-driven text
summarization. Our results could serve as valuable benchmarks for scaling
sequence-to-sequence models to very long sequences.
