Joint entity recognition and relation extraction as a multi-head
  selection problem
State-of-the-art models for joint entity recognition and relation extraction
strongly rely on external natural language processing (NLP) tools such as POS
(part-of-speech) taggers and dependency parsers. Thus, the performance of such
joint models depends on the quality of the features obtained from these NLP
tools. However, these features are not always accurate for various languages
and contexts. In this paper, we propose a joint neural model which performs
entity recognition and relation extraction simultaneously, without the need of
any manually extracted features or the use of any external tool. Specifically,
we model the entity recognition task using a CRF (Conditional Random Fields)
layer and the relation extraction task as a multi-head selection problem (i.e.,
potentially identify multiple relations for each entity). We present an
extensive experimental setup, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
using datasets from various contexts (i.e., news, biomedical, real estate) and
languages (i.e., English, Dutch). Our model outperforms the previous neural
models that use automatically extracted features, while it performs within a
reasonable margin of feature-based neural models, or even beats them.
