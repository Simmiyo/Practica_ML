Semantic Unification A sheaf theoretic approach to natural language
Language is contextual and sheaf theory provides a high level mathematical
framework to model contextuality. We show how sheaf theory can model the
contextual nature of natural language and how gluing can be used to provide a
global semantics for a discourse by putting together the local logical
semantics of each sentence within the discourse. We introduce a presheaf
structure corresponding to a basic form of Discourse Representation Structures.
Within this setting, we formulate a notion of semantic unification --- gluing
meanings of parts of a discourse into a coherent whole --- as a form of
sheaf-theoretic gluing. We illustrate this idea with a number of examples where
it can used to represent resolutions of anaphoric references. We also discuss
multivalued gluing, described using a distributions functor, which can be used
to represent situations where multiple gluings are possible, and where we may
need to rank them using quantitative measures.
