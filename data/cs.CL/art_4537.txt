Characterizing the Influence of Features on Reading Difficulty
  Estimation for Non-native Readers
In recent years, the number of people studying English as a second language
(ESL) has surpassed the number of native speakers. Recent work have
demonstrated the success of providing personalized content based on reading
difficulty, such as information retrieval and summarization. However, almost
all prior studies of reading difficulty are designed for native speakers,
rather than non-native readers. In this study, we investigate various features
for ESL readers, by conducting a linear regression to estimate the reading
level of English language sources. This estimation is based not only on the
complexity of lexical and syntactic features, but also several novel concepts,
including the age of word and grammar acquisition from several sources, word
sense from WordNet, and the implicit relation between sentences. By employing
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to select the optimal model, we find that
the combination of the number of words, the age of word acquisition and the
height of the parsing tree generate better results than alternative competing
models. Thus, our results show that proposed second language reading difficulty
estimation outperforms other first language reading difficulty estimations.
