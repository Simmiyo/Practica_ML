Universal, Unsupervised (Rule-Based), Uncovered Sentiment Analysis
We present a novel unsupervised approach for multilingual sentiment analysis
driven by compositional syntax-based rules. On the one hand, we exploit some of
the main advantages of unsupervised algorithms: (1) the interpretability of
their output, in contrast with most supervised models, which behave as a black
box and (2) their robustness across different corpora and domains. On the other
hand, by introducing the concept of compositional operations and exploiting
syntactic information in the form of universal dependencies, we tackle one of
their main drawbacks: their rigidity on data that are structured differently
depending on the language concerned. Experiments show an improvement both over
existing unsupervised methods, and over state-of-the-art supervised models when
evaluating outside their corpus of origin. Experiments also show how the same
compositional operations can be shared across languages. The system is
