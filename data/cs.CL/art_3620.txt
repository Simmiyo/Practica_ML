Organization and Independence or Interdependence? Study of the
  Neurophysiological Dynamics of Syntactic and Semantic Processing
In this article we present a multivariate model for determining the different
syntactic, semantic, and form (surface-structure) processes underlying the
comprehension of simple phrases. This model is applied to EEG signals recorded
during a reading task. The results show a hierarchical precedence of the
neurolinguistic processes : form, then syntactic and lastly semantic processes.
We also found (a) that verbs are at the heart of phrase syntax processing, (b)
an interaction between syntactic movement within the phrase, and semantic
processes derived from a person-centered reference frame. Eigenvectors of the
multivariate model provide electrode-times profiles that separate the
distinctive linguistic processes and/or highlight their interaction. The
accordance of these findings with different linguistic theories are discussed.
