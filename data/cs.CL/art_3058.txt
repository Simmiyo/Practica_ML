Identifying Restaurant Features via Sentiment Analysis on Yelp Reviews
Many people use Yelp to find a good restaurant. Nonetheless, with only an
overall rating for each restaurant, Yelp offers not enough information for
independently judging its various aspects such as environment, service or
flavor. In this paper, we introduced a machine learning based method to
characterize such aspects for particular types of restaurants. The main
approach used in this paper is to use a support vector machine (SVM) model to
decipher the sentiment tendency of each review from word frequency. Word scores
generated from the SVM models are further processed into a polarity index
indicating the significance of each word for special types of restaurant.
Customers overall tend to express more sentiment regarding service. As for the
distinction between different cuisines, results that match the common sense are
obtained: Japanese cuisines are usually fresh, some French cuisines are
overpriced while Italian Restaurants are often famous for their pizzas.
