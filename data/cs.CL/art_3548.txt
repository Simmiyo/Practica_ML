Computer-Assisted Text Analysis for Social Science: Topic Models and
  Beyond
Topic models are a family of statistical-based algorithms to summarize,
explore and index large collections of text documents. After a decade of
research led by computer scientists, topic models have spread to social science
as a new generation of data-driven social scientists have searched for tools to
explore large collections of unstructured text. Recently, social scientists
have contributed to topic model literature with developments in causal
inference and tools for handling the problem of multi-modality. In this paper,
I provide a literature review on the evolution of topic modeling including
extensions for document covariates, methods for evaluation and interpretation,
and advances in interactive visualizations along with each aspect's relevance
and application for social science research.
