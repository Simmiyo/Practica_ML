ClaiRE at SemEval-2018 Task 7 - Extended Version
In this paper we describe our post-evaluation results for SemEval-2018 Task 7
on clas- sification of semantic relations in scientific literature for clean
(subtask 1.1) and noisy data (subtask 1.2). This is an extended ver- sion of
our workshop paper (Hettinger et al., 2018) including further technical details
(Sec- tions 3.2 and 4.3) and changes made to the preprocessing step in the
post-evaluation phase (Section 2.1). Due to these changes Classification of
Relations using Embeddings (ClaiRE) achieved an improved F1 score of 75.11% for
the first subtask and 81.44% for the second.
