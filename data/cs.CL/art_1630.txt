Lexical and Derivational Meaning in Vector-Based Models of
  Relativisation
Sadrzadeh et al (2013) present a compositional distributional analysis of
relative clauses in English in terms of the Frobenius algebraic structure of
finite dimensional vector spaces. The analysis relies on distinct type
assignments and lexical recipes for subject vs object relativisation. The
situation for Dutch is different: because of the verb final nature of Dutch,
relative clauses are ambiguous between a subject vs object relativisation
reading. Using an extended version of Lambek calculus, we present a
compositional distributional framework that accounts for this derivational
ambiguity, and that allows us to give a single meaning recipe for the relative
pronoun reconciling the Frobenius semantics with the demands of Dutch
derivational syntax.
