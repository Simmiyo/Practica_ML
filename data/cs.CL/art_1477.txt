A Deep Neural Architecture for Sentence-level Sentiment Classification
  in Twitter Social Networking
This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework including a
lexicon-based approach for sentence-level prediction of sentiment label
distribution. We propose to first apply semantic rules and then use a Deep
Convolutional Neural Network (DeepCNN) for character-level embeddings in order
to increase information for word-level embedding. After that, a Bidirectional
Long Short-Term Memory Network (Bi-LSTM) produces a sentence-wide feature
representation from the word-level embedding. We evaluate our approach on three
Twitter sentiment classification datasets. Experimental results show that our
model can improve the classification accuracy of sentence-level sentiment
analysis in Twitter social networking.
