Hybrid approach for transliteration of Algerian arabizi: a primary study
A hybrid approach for the transliteration of Algerian Arabizi: A primary
study In this paper, we present a hybrid approach for the transliteration of
the Algerian Arabizi. We define a set of rules enable us the passage from
Arabizi to Arabic. Through these rules, we generate a set of candidates for the
transliteration of each Arabizi word into arabic. Then, we extract the best
candidate. This approach was evaluated by using three test corpora, and the
obtained results show an improvement of the precision score which is equal to
75.11% for the best result. These results allow us to verify that our approach
is very competitive comparing to others works that treat Arabizi
transliteration in general.
