From narrative descriptions to MedDRA: automagically encoding adverse
  drug reactions
The collection of narrative spontaneous reports is an irreplaceable source
for the prompt detection of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs): qualified
domain experts manually revise a huge amount of narrative descriptions and then
encode texts according to MedDRA standard terminology. The manual annotation of
narrative documents with medical terminology is a subtle and expensive task,
since the number of reports is growing up day-by-day. MagiCoder, a Natural
Language Processing algorithm, is proposed for the automatic encoding of
free-text descriptions into MedDRA terms. MagiCoder procedure is efficient in
terms of computational complexity (in particular, it is linear in the size of
the narrative input and the terminology). We tested it on a large dataset of
about 4500 manually revised reports, by performing an automated comparison
between human and MagiCoder revisions. For the current base version of
MagiCoder, we measured: on short descriptions, an average recall of $86\%$ and
an average precision of $88\%$; on medium-long descriptions (up to 255
characters), an average recall of $64\%$ and an average precision of $63\%$.
From a practical point of view, MagiCoder reduces the time required for
encoding ADR reports. Pharmacologists have simply to review and validate the
MagiCoder terms proposed by the application, instead of choosing the right
terms among the 70K low level terms of MedDRA. Such improvement in the
efficiency of pharmacologists' work has a relevant impact also on the quality
of the subsequent data analysis. We developed MagiCoder for the Italian
pharmacovigilance language. However, our proposal is based on a general
approach, not depending on the considered language nor the term dictionary.
