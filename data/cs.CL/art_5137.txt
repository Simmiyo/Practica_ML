Speaker Diarization With Lexical Information
This work presents a novel approach to leverage lexical information for
speaker diarization. We introduce a speaker diarization system that can
directly integrate lexical as well as acoustic information into a speaker
clustering process. Thus, we propose an adjacency matrix integration technique
to integrate word level speaker turn probabilities with speaker embeddings in a
comprehensive way. Our proposed method works without any reference transcript.
Words, and word boundary information are provided by an ASR system. We show
that our proposed method improves a baseline speaker diarization system solely
based on speaker embeddings, achieving a meaningful improvement on the CALLHOME
American English Speech dataset.
