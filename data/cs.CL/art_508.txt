Statistical Function Tagging and Grammatical Relations of Myanmar
  Sentences
This paper describes a context free grammar (CFG) based grammatical relations
for Myanmar sentences which combine corpus-based function tagging system. Part
of the challenge of statistical function tagging for Myanmar sentences comes
from the fact that Myanmar has free-phrase-order and a complex morphological
system. Function tagging is a pre-processing step to show grammatical relations
of Myanmar sentences. In the task of function tagging, which tags the function
of Myanmar sentences with correct segmentation, POS (part-of-speech) tagging
and chunking information, we use Naive Bayesian theory to disambiguate the
possible function tags of a word. We apply context free grammar (CFG) to find
out the grammatical relations of the function tags. We also create a functional
annotated tagged corpus for Myanmar and propose the grammar rules for Myanmar
sentences. Experiments show that our analysis achieves a good result with
simple sentences and complex sentences.
