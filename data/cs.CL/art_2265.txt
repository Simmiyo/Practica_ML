emLam -- a Hungarian Language Modeling baseline
This paper aims to make up for the lack of documented baselines for Hungarian
language modeling. Various approaches are evaluated on three publicly available
Hungarian corpora. Perplexity values comparable to models of similar-sized
English corpora are reported. A new, freely downloadable Hungar- ian benchmark
corpus is introduced.
