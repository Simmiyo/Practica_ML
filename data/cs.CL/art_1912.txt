Query-Focused Opinion Summarization for User-Generated Content
We present a submodular function-based framework for query-focused opinion
summarization. Within our framework, relevance ordering produced by a
statistical ranker, and information coverage with respect to topic distribution
and diverse viewpoints are both encoded as submodular functions. Dispersion
functions are utilized to minimize the redundancy. We are the first to evaluate
different metrics of text similarity for submodularity-based summarization
methods. By experimenting on community QA and blog summarization, we show that
our system outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both automatic evaluation
and human evaluation. A human evaluation task is conducted on Amazon Mechanical
Turk with scale, and shows that our systems are able to generate summaries of
high overall quality and information diversity.
