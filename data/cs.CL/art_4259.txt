Chinese Poetry Generation with Flexible Styles
Research has shown that sequence-to-sequence neural models, particularly
those with the attention mechanism, can successfully generate classical Chinese
poems. However, neural models are not capable of generating poems that match
specific styles, such as the impulsive style of Li Bai, a famous poet in the
Tang Dynasty. This work proposes a memory-augmented neural model to enable the
generation of style-specific poetry. The key idea is a memory structure that
stores how poems with a desired style were generated by humans, and uses
similar fragments to adjust the generation. We demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm generates poems with flexible styles, including styles of a
particular era and an individual poet.
