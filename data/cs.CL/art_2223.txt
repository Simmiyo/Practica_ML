Fuzzy Based Implicit Sentiment Analysis on Quantitative Sentences
With the rapid growth of social media on the web, emotional polarity
computation has become a flourishing frontier in the text mining community.
However, it is challenging to understand the latest trends and summarize the
state or general opinions about products due to the big diversity and size of
social media data and this creates the need of automated and real time opinion
extraction and mining. On the other hand, the bulk of current research has been
devoted to study the subjective sentences which contain opinion keywords and
limited work has been reported for objective statements that imply sentiment.
In this paper, fuzzy based knowledge engineering model has been developed for
sentiment classification of special group of such sentences including the
change or deviation from desired range or value. Drug reviews are the rich
source of such statements. Therefore, in this research, some experiments were
carried out on patient's reviews on several different cholesterol lowering
drugs to determine their sentiment polarity. The main conclusion through this
study is, in order to increase the accuracy level of existing drug opinion
mining systems, objective sentences which imply opinion should be taken into
account. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model obtains
over 72 percent F1 value.
