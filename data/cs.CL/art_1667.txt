MotàMot project: conversion of a French-Khmer published dictionary for
  building a multilingual lexical system
Economic issues related to the information processing techniques are very
important. The development of such technologies is a major asset for developing
countries like Cambodia and Laos, and emerging ones like Vietnam, Malaysia and
Thailand. The MotAMot project aims to computerize an under-resourced language:
Khmer, spoken mainly in Cambodia. The main goal of the project is the
development of a multilingual lexical system targeted for Khmer. The
macrostructure is a pivot one with each word sense of each language linked to a
pivot axi. The microstructure comes from a simplification of the explanatory
and combinatory dictionary. The lexical system has been initialized with data
coming mainly from the conversion of the French-Khmer bilingual dictionary of
Denis Richer from Word to XML format. The French part was completed with
pronunciation and parts-of-speech coming from the FeM French-english-Malay
dictionary. The Khmer headwords noted in IPA in the Richer dictionary were
converted to Khmer writing with OpenFST, a finite state transducer tool. The
resulting resource is available online for lookup, editing, download and remote
programming via a REST API on a Jibiki platform.
