Combining neural and knowledge-based approaches to Named Entity
  Recognition in Polish
Named entity recognition (NER) is one of the tasks in natural language
processing that can greatly benefit from the use of external knowledge sources.
We propose a named entity recognition framework composed of knowledge-based
feature extractors and a deep learning model including contextual word
embeddings, long short-term memory (LSTM) layers and conditional random fields
(CRF) inference layer. We use an entity linking module to integrate our system
with Wikipedia. The combination of effective neural architecture and external
resources allows us to obtain state-of-the-art results on recognition of Polish
proper names. We evaluate our model on data from PolEval 2018 NER challenge on
which it outperforms other methods, reducing the error rate by 22.4% compared
to the winning solution. Our work shows that combining neural NER model and
entity linking model with a knowledge base is more effective in recognizing
named entities than using NER model alone.
