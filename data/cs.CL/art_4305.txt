UH-PRHLT at SemEval-2016 Task 3: Combining Lexical and Semantic-based
  Features for Community Question Answering
In this work we describe the system built for the three English subtasks of
the SemEval 2016 Task 3 by the Department of Computer Science of the University
of Houston (UH) and the Pattern Recognition and Human Language Technology
(PRHLT) research center - Universitat Polit`ecnica de Val`encia: UH-PRHLT. Our
system represents instances by using both lexical and semantic-based similarity
measures between text pairs. Our semantic features include the use of
distributed representations of words, knowledge graphs generated with the
BabelNet multilingual semantic network, and the FrameNet lexical database.
Experimental results outperform the random and Google search engine baselines
in the three English subtasks. Our approach obtained the highest results of
subtask B compared to the other task participants.
