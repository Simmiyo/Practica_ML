DepAnn - An Annotation Tool for Dependency Treebanks
DepAnn is an interactive annotation tool for dependency treebanks, providing
both graphical and text-based annotation interfaces. The tool is aimed for
semi-automatic creation of treebanks. It aids the manual inspection and
correction of automatically created parses, making the annotation process
faster and less error-prone. A novel feature of the tool is that it enables the
user to view outputs from several parsers as the basis for creating the final
tree to be saved to the treebank. DepAnn uses TIGER-XML, an XML-based general
encoding format for both, representing the parser outputs and saving the
annotated treebank. The tool includes an automatic consistency checker for
sentence structures. In addition, the tool enables users to build structures
manually, add comments on the annotations, modify the tagsets, and mark
sentences for further revision.
