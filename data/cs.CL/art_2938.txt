A Simple LSTM model for Transition-based Dependency Parsing
We present a simple LSTM-based transition-based dependency parser. Our model
is composed of a single LSTM hidden layer replacing the hidden layer in the
usual feed-forward network architecture. We also propose a new initialization
method that uses the pre-trained weights from a feed-forward neural network to
initialize our LSTM-based model. We also show that using dropout on the input
layer has a positive effect on performance. Our final parser achieves a 93.06%
unlabeled and 91.01% labeled attachment score on the Penn Treebank. We
additionally replace LSTMs with GRUs and Elman units in our model and explore
the effectiveness of our initialization method on individual gates constituting
all three types of RNN units.
