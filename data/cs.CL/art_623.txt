Competency Tracking for English as a Second or Foreign Language Learners
My system utilizes the outcomes feature found in Moodle and other learning
content management systems (LCMSs) to keep track of where students are in terms
of what language competencies they have mastered and the competencies they need
to get where they want to go. These competencies are based on the Common
European Framework for (English) Language Learning. This data can be available
for everyone involved with a given student's progress (e.g. educators, parents,
supervisors and the students themselves). A given student's record of past
accomplishments can also be meshed with those of his classmates. Not only are a
student's competencies easily seen and tracked, educators can view competencies
of a group of students that were achieved prior to enrollment in the class.
This should make curriculum decision making easier and more efficient for
educators.
