Detecting and assessing contextual change in diachronic text documents
  using context volatility
Terms in diachronic text corpora may exhibit a high degree of semantic
dynamics that is only partially captured by the common notion of semantic
change. The new measure of context volatility that we propose models the degree
by which terms change context in a text collection over time. The computation
of context volatility for a word relies on the significance-values of its
co-occurrent terms and the corresponding co-occurrence ranks in sequential time
spans. We define a baseline and present an efficient computational approach in
order to overcome problems related to computational issues in the data
structure. Results are evaluated both, on synthetic documents that are used to
simulate contextual changes, and a real example based on British newspaper
texts.
