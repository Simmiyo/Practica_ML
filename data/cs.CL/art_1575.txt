Unsupervised Morphological Expansion of Small Datasets for Improving
  Word Embeddings
We present a language independent, unsupervised method for building word
embeddings using morphological expansion of text. Our model handles the problem
of data sparsity and yields improved word embeddings by relying on training
word embeddings on artificially generated sentences. We evaluate our method
using small sized training sets on eleven test sets for the word similarity
task across seven languages. Further, for English, we evaluated the impacts of
our approach using a large training set on three standard test sets. Our method
improved results across all languages.
