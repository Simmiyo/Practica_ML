Deep Learning Based Natural Language Processing for End to End Speech
  Translation
Deep Learning methods employ multiple processing layers to learn hierarchial
representations of data. They have already been deployed in a humongous number
of applications and have produced state-of-the-art results. Recently with the
growth in processing power of computers to be able to do high dimensional
tensor calculations, Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications have been
given a significant boost in terms of efficiency as well as accuracy. In this
paper, we will take a look at various signal processing techniques and then
application of them to produce a speech-to-text system using Deep Recurrent
Neural Networks.
