MAG: A Multilingual, Knowledge-base Agnostic and Deterministic Entity
  Linking Approach
Entity linking has recently been the subject of a significant body of
research. Currently, the best performing approaches rely on trained
mono-lingual models. Porting these approaches to other languages is
consequently a difficult endeavor as it requires corresponding training data
and retraining of the models. We address this drawback by presenting a novel
multilingual, knowledge-based agnostic and deterministic approach to entity
linking, dubbed MAG. MAG is based on a combination of context-based retrieval
on structured knowledge bases and graph algorithms. We evaluate MAG on 23 data
sets and in 7 languages. Our results show that the best approach trained on
English datasets (PBOH) achieves a micro F-measure that is up to 4 times worse
on datasets in other languages. MAG, on the other hand, achieves
state-of-the-art performance on English datasets and reaches a micro F-measure
that is up to 0.6 higher than that of PBOH on non-English languages.
