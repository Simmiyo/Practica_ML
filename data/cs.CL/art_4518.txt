Graphene: A Context-Preserving Open Information Extraction System
We introduce Graphene, an Open IE system whose goal is to generate accurate,
meaningful and complete propositions that may facilitate a variety of
downstream semantic applications. For this purpose, we transform syntactically
complex input sentences into clean, compact structures in the form of core
facts and accompanying contexts, while identifying the rhetorical relations
that hold between them in order to maintain their semantic relationship. In
that way, we preserve the context of the relational tuples extracted from a
source sentence, generating a novel lightweight semantic representation for
Open IE that enhances the expressiveness of the extracted propositions.
