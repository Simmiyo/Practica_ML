MADARi: A Web Interface for Joint Arabic Morphological Annotation and
  Spelling Correction
In this paper, we introduce MADARi, a joint morphological annotation and
spelling correction system for texts in Standard and Dialectal Arabic. The
MADARi framework provides intuitive interfaces for annotating text and managing
the annotation process of a large number of sizable documents. Morphological
annotation includes indicating, for a word, in context, its baseword, clitics,
part-of-speech, lemma, gloss, and dialect identification. MADARi has a suite of
utilities to help with annotator productivity. For example, annotators are
provided with pre-computed analyses to assist them in their task and reduce the
amount of work needed to complete it. MADARi also allows annotators to query a
morphological analyzer for a list of possible analyses in multiple dialects or
look up previously submitted analyses. The MADARi management interface enables
a lead annotator to easily manage and organize the whole annotation process
remotely and concurrently. We describe the motivation, design and
implementation of this interface; and we present details from a user study
working with this system.
