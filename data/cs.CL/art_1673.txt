An HMM Based Named Entity Recognition System for Indian Languages: The
  JU System at ICON 2013
This paper reports about our work in the ICON 2013 NLP TOOLS CONTEST on Named
Entity Recognition. We submitted runs for Bengali, English, Hindi, Marathi,
Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu. A statistical HMM (Hidden Markov Models) based model
has been used to implement our system. The system has been trained and tested
on the NLP TOOLS CONTEST: ICON 2013 datasets. Our system obtains F-measures of
0.8599, 0.7704, 0.7520, 0.4289, 0.5455, 0.4466, and 0.4003 for Bengali,
English, Hindi, Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu respectively.
