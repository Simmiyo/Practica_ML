Anusaaraka: Overcoming the Language Barrier in India
The anusaaraka system makes text in one Indian language accessible in another
Indian language. In the anusaaraka approach, the load is so divided between man
and computer that the language load is taken by the machine, and the
interpretation of the text is left to the man. The machine presents an image of
the source text in a language close to the target language.In the image, some
constructions of the source language (which do not have equivalents) spill over
to the output. Some special notation is also devised. The user after some
training learns to read and understand the output. Because the Indian languages
are close, the learning time of the output language is short, and is expected
to be around 2 weeks.
  The output can also be post-edited by a trained user to make it grammatically
correct in the target language. Style can also be changed, if necessary. Thus,
in this scenario, it can function as a human assisted translation system.
  Currently, anusaarakas are being built from Telugu, Kannada, Marathi, Bengali
and Punjabi to Hindi. They can be built for all Indian languages in the near
future. Everybody must pitch in to build such systems connecting all Indian
languages, using the free software model.
