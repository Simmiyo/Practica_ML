An Empirical Analysis of the Correlation of Syntax and Prosody
The relation of syntax and prosody (the syntax--prosody interface) has been
an active area of research, mostly in linguistics and typically studied under
controlled conditions. More recently, prosody has also been successfully used
in the data-based training of syntax parsers. However, there is a gap between
the controlled and detailed study of the individual effects between syntax and
prosody and the large-scale application of prosody in syntactic parsing with
only a shallow analysis of the respective influences. In this paper, we close
the gap by investigating the significance of correlations of prosodic
realization with specific syntactic functions using linear mixed effects models
in a very large corpus of read-out German encyclopedic texts. Using this
corpus, we are able to analyze prosodic structuring performed by a diverse set
of speakers while they try to optimize factual content delivery. After
normalization by speaker, we obtain significant effects, e.g. confirming that
the subject function, as compared to the object function, has a positive effect
on pitch and duration of a word, but a negative effect on loudness.
