Language Identification of Bengali-English Code-Mixed data using
  Character & Phonetic based LSTM Models
Language identification of social media text still remains a challenging task
due to properties like code-mixing and inconsistent phonetic transliterations.
In this paper, we present a supervised learning approach for language
identification at the word level of low resource Bengali-English code-mixed
data taken from social media. We employ two methods of word encoding, namely
character based and root phone based to train our deep LSTM models. Utilizing
these two models we created two ensemble models using stacking and threshold
technique which gave 91.78% and 92.35% accuracies respectively on our testing
data.
