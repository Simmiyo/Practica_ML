Extracting a bilingual semantic grammar from FrameNet-annotated corpora
We present the creation of an English-Swedish FrameNet-based grammar in
Grammatical Framework. The aim of this research is to make existing framenets
computationally accessible for multilingual natural language applications via a
common semantic grammar API, and to facilitate the porting of such grammar to
other languages. In this paper, we describe the abstract syntax of the semantic
grammar while focusing on its automatic extraction possibilities. We have
extracted a shared abstract syntax from ~58,500 annotated sentences in Berkeley
FrameNet (BFN) and ~3,500 annotated sentences in Swedish FrameNet (SweFN). The
abstract syntax defines 769 frame-specific valence patterns that cover 77.8%
examples in BFN and 74.9% in SweFN belonging to the shared set of 471 frames.
As a side result, we provide a unified method for comparing semantic and
syntactic valence patterns across framenets.
