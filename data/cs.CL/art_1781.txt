Detecting state of aggression in sentences using CNN
In this article we study verbal expression of aggression and its detection
using machine learning and neural networks methods. We test our results using
our corpora of messages from anonymous imageboards. We also compare Random
forest classifier with convolutional neural network for "Movie reviews with one
sentence per review" corpus.
