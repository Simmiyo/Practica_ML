Corpora Preparation and Stopword List Generation for Arabic data in
  Social Network
This paper proposes a methodology to prepare corpora in Arabic language from
online social network (OSN) and review site for Sentiment Analysis (SA) task.
The paper also proposes a methodology for generating a stopword list from the
prepared corpora. The aim of the paper is to investigate the effect of removing
stopwords on the SA task. The problem is that the stopwords lists generated
before were on Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) which is not the common language
used in OSN. We have generated a stopword list of Egyptian dialect and a
corpus-based list to be used with the OSN corpora. We compare the efficiency of
text classification when using the generated lists along with previously
generated lists of MSA and combining the Egyptian dialect list with the MSA
list. The text classification was performed using Na\"ive Bayes and Decision
Tree classifiers and two feature selection approaches, unigrams and bigram. The
experiments show that the general lists containing the Egyptian dialects words
give better performance than using lists of MSA stopwords only.
