Rule-weighted and terminal-weighted context-free grammars have identical
  expressivity
Two formalisms, both based on context-free grammars, have recently been
proposed as a basis for a non-uniform random generation of combinatorial
objects. The former, introduced by Denise et al, associates weights with
letters, while the latter, recently explored by Weinberg et al in the context
of random generation, associates weights to transitions. In this short note, we
use a simple modification of the Greibach Normal Form transformation algorithm,
due to Blum and Koch, to show the equivalent expressivities, in term of their
induced distributions, of these two formalisms.
