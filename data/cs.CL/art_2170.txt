Evaluating Automatic Speech Recognition Systems in Comparison With Human
  Perception Results Using Distinctive Feature Measures
This paper describes methods for evaluating automatic speech recognition
(ASR) systems in comparison with human perception results, using measures
derived from linguistic distinctive features. Error patterns in terms of
manner, place and voicing are presented, along with an examination of confusion
matrices via a distinctive-feature-distance metric. These evaluation methods
contrast with conventional performance criteria that focus on the phone or word
level, and are intended to provide a more detailed profile of ASR system
performance,as well as a means for direct comparison with human perception
results at the sub-phonemic level.
