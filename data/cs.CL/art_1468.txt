JaTeCS an open-source JAva TExt Categorization System
JaTeCS is an open source Java library that supports research on automatic
text categorization and other related problems, such as ordinal regression and
quantification, which are of special interest in opinion mining applications.
It covers all the steps of an experimental activity, from reading the corpus to
the evaluation of the experimental results. As JaTeCS is focused on text as the
main input data, it provides the user with many text-dedicated tools, e.g.:
data readers for many formats, including the most commonly used text corpora
and lexical resources, natural language processing tools, multi-language
support, methods for feature selection and weighting, the implementation of
many machine learning algorithms as well as wrappers for well-known external
software (e.g., SVM_light) which enable their full control from code. JaTeCS
support its expansion by abstracting through interfaces many of the typical
tools and procedures used in text processing tasks. The library also provides a
number of "template" implementations of typical experimental setups (e.g.,
train-test, k-fold validation, grid-search optimization, randomized runs) which
enable fast realization of experiments just by connecting the templates with
data readers, learning algorithms and evaluation measures.
