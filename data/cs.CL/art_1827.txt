Automatic TM Cleaning through MT and POS Tagging: Autodesk's Submission
  to the NLP4TM 2016 Shared Task
We describe a machine learning based method to identify incorrect entries in
translation memories. It extends previous work by Barbu (2015) through
incorporating recall-based machine translation and part-of-speech-tagging
features. Our system ranked first in the Binary Classification (II) task for
two out of three language pairs: English-Italian and English-Spanish.
