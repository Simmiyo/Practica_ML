Unsupervised Part-of-Speech Induction
Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging is an old and fundamental task in natural
language processing. While supervised POS taggers have shown promising
accuracy, it is not always feasible to use supervised methods due to lack of
labeled data. In this project, we attempt to unsurprisingly induce POS tags by
iteratively looking for a recurring pattern of words through a hierarchical
agglomerative clustering process. Our approach shows promising results when
compared to the tagging results of the state-of-the-art unsupervised POS
taggers.
