Evaluation of Hindi to Punjabi Machine Translation System
Machine Translation in India is relatively young. The earliest efforts date
from the late 80s and early 90s. The success of every system is judged from its
evaluation experimental results. Number of machine translation systems has been
started for development but to the best of author knowledge, no high quality
system has been completed which can be used in real applications. Recently,
Punjabi University, Patiala, India has developed Punjabi to Hindi Machine
translation system with high accuracy of about 92%. Both the systems i.e.
system under question and developed system are between same closely related
languages. Thus, this paper presents the evaluation results of Hindi to Punjabi
machine translation system. It makes sense to use same evaluation criteria as
that of Punjabi to Hindi Punjabi Machine Translation System. After evaluation,
the accuracy of the system is found to be about 95%.
