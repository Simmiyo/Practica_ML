Using of heterogeneous corpora for training of an ASR system
The paper summarizes the development of the LVCSR system built as a part of
the Pashto speech-translation system at the SCALE (Summer Camp for Applied
Language Exploration) 2015 workshop on "Speech-to-text-translation for
low-resource languages". The Pashto language was chosen as a good "proxy"
low-resource language, exhibiting multiple phenomena which make the
speech-recognition and and speech-to-text-translation systems development hard.
  Even when the amount of data is seemingly sufficient, given the fact that the
data originates from multiple sources, the preliminary experiments reveal that
there is little to no benefit in merging (concatenating) the corpora and more
elaborate ways of making use of all of the data must be worked out.
  This paper concentrates only on the LVCSR part and presents a range of
different techniques that were found to be useful in order to benefit from
multiple different corpora
