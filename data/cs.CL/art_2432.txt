A Sentence Simplification System for Improving Relation Extraction
In this demo paper, we present a text simplification approach that is
directed at improving the performance of state-of-the-art Open Relation
Extraction (RE) systems. As syntactically complex sentences often pose a
challenge for current Open RE approaches, we have developed a simplification
framework that performs a pre-processing step by taking a single sentence as
input and using a set of syntactic-based transformation rules to create a
textual input that is easier to process for subsequently applied Open RE
systems.
