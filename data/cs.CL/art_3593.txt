Who framed Roger Reindeer? De-censorship of Facebook posts by snippet
  classification
This paper considers online news censorship and it concentrates on censorship
of identities. Obfuscating identities may occur for disparate reasons, from
military to judiciary ones. In the majority of cases, this happens to protect
individuals from being identified and persecuted by hostile people. However,
being the collaborative web characterised by a redundancy of information, it is
not unusual that the same fact is reported by multiple sources, which may not
apply the same restriction policies in terms of censorship. Also, the proven
aptitude of social network users to disclose personal information leads to the
phenomenon that comments to news can reveal the data withheld in the news
itself. This gives us a mean to figure out who the subject of the censored news
is. We propose an adaptation of a text analysis approach to unveil censored
identities. The approach is tested on a synthesised scenario, which however
resembles a real use case. Leveraging a text analysis based on a context
classifier trained over snippets from posts and comments of Facebook pages, we
achieve promising results. Despite the quite constrained settings in which we
operate -- such as considering only snippets of very short length -- our system
successfully detects the censored name, choosing among 10 different candidate
names, in more than 50\% of the investigated cases. This outperforms the
results of two reference baselines. The findings reported in this paper, other
than being supported by a thorough experimental methodology and interesting on
their own, also pave the way for further investigation on the insidious issues
of censorship on the web.
