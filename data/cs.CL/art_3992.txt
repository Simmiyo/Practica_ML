OpenNMT: Neural Machine Translation Toolkit
OpenNMT is an open-source toolkit for neural machine translation (NMT). The
system prioritizes efficiency, modularity, and extensibility with the goal of
supporting NMT research into model architectures, feature representations, and
source modalities, while maintaining competitive performance and reasonable
training requirements. The toolkit consists of modeling and translation
support, as well as detailed pedagogical documentation about the underlying
techniques. OpenNMT has been used in several production MT systems, modified
for numerous research papers, and is implemented across several deep learning
frameworks.
