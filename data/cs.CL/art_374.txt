Non-Parametric Bayesian Areal Linguistics
We describe a statistical model over linguistic areas and phylogeny.
  Our model recovers known areas and identifies a plausible hierarchy of areal
features. The use of areas improves genetic reconstruction of languages both
qualitatively and quantitatively according to a variety of metrics. We model
linguistic areas by a Pitman-Yor process and linguistic phylogeny by Kingman's
coalescent.
