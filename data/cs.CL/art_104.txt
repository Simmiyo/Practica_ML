Language identification of controlled systems: Modelling, control and
  anomaly detection
Formal language techniques have been used in the past to study autonomous
dynamical systems. However, for controlled systems, new features are needed to
distinguish between information generated by the system and input control. We
show how the modelling framework for controlled dynamical systems leads
naturally to a formulation in terms of context-dependent grammars. A learning
algorithm is proposed for on-line generation of the grammar productions, this
formulation being then used for modelling, control and anomaly detection.
Practical applications are described for electromechanical drives. Grammatical
interpolation techniques yield accurate results and the pattern detection
capabilities of the language-based formulation makes it a promising technique
for the early detection of anomalies or faulty behaviour.
