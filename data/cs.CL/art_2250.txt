Deep Neural Networks for Czech Multi-label Document Classification
This paper is focused on automatic multi-label document classification of
Czech text documents. The current approaches usually use some pre-processing
which can have negative impact (loss of information, additional implementation
work, etc). Therefore, we would like to omit it and use deep neural networks
that learn from simple features. This choice was motivated by their successful
usage in many other machine learning fields. Two different networks are
compared: the first one is a standard multi-layer perceptron, while the second
one is a popular convolutional network. The experiments on a Czech newspaper
corpus show that both networks significantly outperform baseline method which
uses a rich set of features with maximum entropy classifier. We have also shown
that convolutional network gives the best results.
