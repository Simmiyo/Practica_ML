Requirements of Text Processing Lexicons
As text processing systems expand in scope, they will require ever larger
lexicons along with a parsing capability for discriminating among many senses
of a word. Existing systems do not incorporate such subtleties in meaning for
their lexicons. Ordinary dictionaries contain such information, but are largely
untapped. When the contents of dictionaries are scrutinized, they reveal many
requirements that must be satisfied in representing meaning and in developing
semantic parsers. These requirements were identified in research designed to
find primitive verb concepts. The requirements are outlined and general
procedures for satisfying them through the use of ordinary dictionaries are
described, illustrated by building frames for and examining the definitions of
"change" and its uses as a hypernym in other definitions.
