Entrainment profiles: Comparison by gender, role, and feature set
We examine prosodic entrainment in cooperative game dialogs for new feature
sets describing register, pitch accent shape, and rhythmic aspects of
utterances. For these as well as for established features we present
entrainment profiles to detect within- and across-dialog entrainment by the
speakers' gender and role in the game. It turned out, that feature sets undergo
entrainment in different quantitative and qualitative ways, which can partly be
attributed to their different functions. Furthermore, interactions between
speaker gender and role (describer vs. follower) suggest gender-dependent
strategies in cooperative solution-oriented interactions: female describers
entrain most, male describers least. Our data suggests a slight advantage of
the latter strategy on task success.
