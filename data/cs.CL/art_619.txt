A framework for (under)specifying dependency syntax without overloading
  annotators
We introduce a framework for lightweight dependency syntax annotation. Our
formalism builds upon the typical representation for unlabeled dependencies,
permitting a simple notation and annotation workflow. Moreover, the formalism
encourages annotators to underspecify parts of the syntax if doing so would
streamline the annotation process. We demonstrate the efficacy of this
annotation on three languages and develop algorithms to evaluate and compare
underspecified annotations.
