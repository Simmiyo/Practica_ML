Real Multi-Sense or Pseudo Multi-Sense: An Approach to Improve Word
  Representation
Previous researches have shown that learning multiple representations for
polysemous words can improve the performance of word embeddings on many tasks.
However, this leads to another problem. Several vectors of a word may actually
point to the same meaning, namely pseudo multi-sense. In this paper, we
introduce the concept of pseudo multi-sense, and then propose an algorithm to
detect such cases. With the consideration of the detected pseudo multi-sense
cases, we try to refine the existing word embeddings to eliminate the influence
of pseudo multi-sense. Moreover, we apply our algorithm on previous released
multi-sense word embeddings and tested it on artificial word similarity tasks
and the analogy task. The result of the experiments shows that diminishing
pseudo multi-sense can improve the quality of word representations. Thus, our
method is actually an efficient way to reduce linguistic complexity.
