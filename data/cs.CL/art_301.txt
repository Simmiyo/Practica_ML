Building a resource for studying translation shifts
This paper describes an interdisciplinary approach which brings together the
fields of corpus linguistics and translation studies. It presents ongoing work
on the creation of a corpus resource in which translation shifts are explicitly
annotated. Translation shifts denote departures from formal correspondence
between source and target text, i.e. deviations that have occurred during the
translation process. A resource in which such shifts are annotated in a
systematic way will make it possible to study those phenomena that need to be
addressed if machine translation output is to resemble human translation. The
resource described in this paper contains English source texts (parliamentary
proceedings) and their German translations. The shift annotation is based on
predicate-argument structures and proceeds in two steps: first, predicates and
their arguments are annotated monolingually in a straightforward manner. Then,
the corresponding English and German predicates and arguments are aligned with
each other. Whenever a shift - mainly grammatical or semantic -has occurred,
the alignment is tagged accordingly.
