Determination of the Internet Anonymity Influence on the Level of
  Aggression and Usage of Obscene Lexis
This article deals with the analysis of the semantic content of the anonymous
Russian-speaking forum 2ch.hk, different verbal means of expressing of the
emotional state of aggression are revealed for this site, and aggression is
classified by its directions. The lexis of different Russian-and English-
speaking anonymous forums (2ch.hk and iichan.hk, 4chan.org) and public
community "MDK" of the Russian-speaking social network VK is analyzed and
compared with the Open Corpus of the Russian language (Opencorpora.org and
Brown corpus). The analysis shows that anonymity has no influence on the amount
of invective items usage. The effectiveness of moderation was shown for
anonymous forums. It was established that Russian obscene lexis was used to
express the emotional state of aggression only in 60.4% of cases for 2ch.hk.
These preliminary results show that the Russian obscene lexis on the Internet
does not have direct dependence on the emotional state of aggression.
