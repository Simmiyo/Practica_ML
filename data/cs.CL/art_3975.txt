Connecting Distant Entities with Induction through Conditional Random
  Fields for Named Entity Recognition: Precursor-Induced CRF
This paper presents a method of designing specific high-order dependency
factor on the linear chain conditional random fields (CRFs) for named entity
recognition (NER). Named entities tend to be separated from each other by
multiple outside tokens in a text, and thus the first-order CRF, as well as the
second-order CRF, may innately lose transition information between distant
named entities. The proposed design uses outside label in NER as a transmission
medium of precedent entity information on the CRF. Then, empirical results
apparently demonstrate that it is possible to exploit long-distance label
dependency in the original first-order linear chain CRF structure upon NER
while reducing computational loss rather than in the second-order CRF.
