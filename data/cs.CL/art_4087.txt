ISO-Standard Domain-Independent Dialogue Act Tagging for Conversational
  Agents
Dialogue Act (DA) tagging is crucial for spoken language understanding
systems, as it provides a general representation of speakers' intents, not
bound to a particular dialogue system. Unfortunately, publicly available data
sets with DA annotation are all based on different annotation schemes and thus
incompatible with each other. Moreover, their schemes often do not cover all
aspects necessary for open-domain human-machine interaction. In this paper, we
propose a methodology to map several publicly available corpora to a subset of
the ISO standard, in order to create a large task-independent training corpus
for DA classification. We show the feasibility of using this corpus to train a
domain-independent DA tagger testing it on out-of-domain conversational data,
and argue the importance of training on multiple corpora to achieve robustness
across different DA categories.
