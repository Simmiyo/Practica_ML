Towards Accurate Deceptive Opinion Spam Detection based on Word
  Order-preserving CNN
Nowadays, deep learning has been widely used. In natural language learning,
the analysis of complex semantics has been achieved because of its high degree
of flexibility. The deceptive opinions detection is an important application
area in deep learning model, and related mechanisms have been given attention
and researched. On-line opinions are quite short, varied types and content. In
order to effectively identify deceptive opinions, we need to comprehensively
study the characteristics of deceptive opinions, and explore novel
characteristics besides the textual semantics and emotional polarity that have
been widely used in text analysis. The detection mechanism based on deep
learning has better self-adaptability and can effectively identify all kinds of
deceptive opinions. In this paper, we optimize the convolution neural network
model by embedding the word order characteristics in its convolution layer and
pooling layer, which makes convolution neural network more suitable for various
text classification and deceptive opinions detection. The TensorFlow-based
experiments demonstrate that the detection mechanism proposed in this paper
achieve more accurate deceptive opinion detection results.
