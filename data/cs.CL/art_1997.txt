Synthetic Language Generation and Model Validation in BEAST2
Generating synthetic languages aids in the testing and validation of future
computational linguistic models and methods. This thesis extends the BEAST2
phylogenetic framework to add linguistic sequence generation under multiple
models. The new plugin is then used to test the effects of the phenomena of
word borrowing on the inference process under two widely used phylolinguistic
models.
