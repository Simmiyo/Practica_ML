ANN-based Innovative Segmentation Method for Handwritten text in
  Assamese
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) s has widely been used for recognition of
optically scanned character, which partially emulates human thinking in the
domain of the Artificial Intelligence. But prior to recognition, it is
necessary to segment the character from the text to sentences, words etc.
Segmentation of words into individual letters has been one of the major
problems in handwriting recognition. Despite several successful works all over
the work, development of such tools in specific languages is still an ongoing
process especially in the Indian context. This work explores the application of
ANN as an aid to segmentation of handwritten characters in Assamese- an
important language in the North Eastern part of India. The work explores the
performance difference obtained in applying an ANN-based dynamic segmentation
algorithm compared to projection- based static segmentation. The algorithm
involves, first training of an ANN with individual handwritten characters
recorded from different individuals. Handwritten sentences are separated out
from text using a static segmentation method. From the segmented line,
individual characters are separated out by first over segmenting the entire
line. Each of the segments thus obtained, next, is fed to the trained ANN. The
point of segmentation at which the ANN recognizes a segment or a combination of
several segments to be similar to a handwritten character, a segmentation
boundary for the character is assumed to exist and segmentation performed. The
segmented character is next compared to the best available match and the
segmentation boundary confirmed.
