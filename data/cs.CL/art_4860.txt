UMONS Submission for WMT18 Multimodal Translation Task
This paper describes the UMONS solution for the Multimodal Machine
Translation Task presented at the third conference on machine translation
(WMT18). We explore a novel architecture, called deepGRU, based on recent
findings in the related task of Neural Image Captioning (NIC). The models
presented in the following sections lead to the best METEOR translation score
for both constrained (English, image) -> German and (English, image) -> French
sub-tasks.
