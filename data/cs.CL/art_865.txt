Rehabilitation of Count-based Models for Word Vector Representations
Recent works on word representations mostly rely on predictive models.
Distributed word representations (aka word embeddings) are trained to optimally
predict the contexts in which the corresponding words tend to appear. Such
models have succeeded in capturing word similarties as well as semantic and
syntactic regularities. Instead, we aim at reviving interest in a model based
on counts. We present a systematic study of the use of the Hellinger distance
to extract semantic representations from the word co-occurence statistics of
large text corpora. We show that this distance gives good performance on word
similarity and analogy tasks, with a proper type and size of context, and a
dimensionality reduction based on a stochastic low-rank approximation. Besides
being both simple and intuitive, this method also provides an encoding function
which can be used to infer unseen words or phrases. This becomes a clear
advantage compared to predictive models which must train these new words.
