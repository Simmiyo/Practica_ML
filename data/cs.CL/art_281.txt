A Bimachine Compiler for Ranked Tagging Rules
This paper describes a novel method of compiling ranked tagging rules into a
deterministic finite-state device called a bimachine. The rules are formulated
in the framework of regular rewrite operations and allow unrestricted regular
expressions in both left and right rule contexts. The compiler is illustrated
by an application within a speech synthesis system.
