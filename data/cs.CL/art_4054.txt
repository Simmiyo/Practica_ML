An Exploration of Unreliable News Classification in Brazil and The U.S
The propagation of unreliable information is on the rise in many places
around the world. This expansion is facilitated by the rapid spread of
information and anonymity granted by the Internet. The spread of unreliable
information is a wellstudied issue and it is associated with negative social
impacts. In a previous work, we have identified significant differences in the
structure of news articles from reliable and unreliable sources in the US
media. Our goal in this work was to explore such differences in the Brazilian
media. We found significant features in two data sets: one with Brazilian news
in Portuguese and another one with US news in English. Our results show that
features related to the writing style were prominent in both data sets and,
despite the language difference, some features have a universal behavior, being
significant to both US and Brazilian news articles. Finally, we combined both
data sets and used the universal features to build a machine learning
classifier to predict the source type of a news article as reliable or
unreliable.
