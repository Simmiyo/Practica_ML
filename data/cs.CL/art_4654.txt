literature, there are numerous approaches proposed for automatic sentiment
analysis for different language contexts. Each language has its own properties

presents a comprehensive survey of existing Arabic sentiment analysis studies,
and covers the various approaches and techniques proposed in the literature.
Moreover, we highlight the main difficulties and challenges of Arabic sentiment
analysis, and the proposed techniques in literature to overcome these barriers.
