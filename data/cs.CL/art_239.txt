An Algorithm for Aligning Sentences in Bilingual Corpora Using Lexical
  Information
In this paper we describe an algorithm for aligning sentences with their
translations in a bilingual corpus using lexical information of the languages.
Existing efficient algorithms ignore word identities and consider only the
sentence lengths (Brown, 1991; Gale and Church, 1993). For a sentence in the
source language text, the proposed algorithm picks the most likely translation
from the target language text using lexical information and certain heuristics.
It does not do statistical analysis using sentence lengths. The algorithm is
language independent. It also aids in detecting addition and deletion of text
in translations. The algorithm gives comparable results with the existing
algorithms in most of the cases while it does better in cases where statistical
algorithms do not give good results.
