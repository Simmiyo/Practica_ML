Unsupervised Sense-Aware Hypernymy Extraction
In this paper, we show how unsupervised sense representations can be used to
improve hypernymy extraction. We present a method for extracting disambiguated
hypernymy relationships that propagates hypernyms to sets of synonyms
(synsets), constructs embeddings for these sets, and establishes sense-aware
relationships between matching synsets. Evaluation on two gold standard
datasets for English and Russian shows that the method successfully recognizes
hypernymy relationships that cannot be found with standard Hearst patterns and
Wiktionary datasets for the respective languages.
