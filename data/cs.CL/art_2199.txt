Stateology: State-Level Interactive Charting of Language, Feelings, and
  Values
People's personality and motivations are manifest in their everyday language
usage. With the emergence of social media, ample examples of such usage are
procurable. In this paper, we aim to analyze the vocabulary used by close to
200,000 Blogger users in the U.S. with the purpose of geographically portraying
various demographic, linguistic, and psychological dimensions at the state
level. We give a description of a web-based tool for viewing maps that depict
various characteristics of the social media users as derived from this large
blog dataset of over two billion words.
