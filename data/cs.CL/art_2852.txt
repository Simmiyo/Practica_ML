Referenceless Quality Estimation for Natural Language Generation
Traditional automatic evaluation measures for natural language generation
(NLG) use costly human-authored references to estimate the quality of a system
output. In this paper, we propose a referenceless quality estimation (QE)
approach based on recurrent neural networks, which predicts a quality score for
a NLG system output by comparing it to the source meaning representation only.
Our method outperforms traditional metrics and a constant baseline in most
respects; we also show that synthetic data helps to increase correlation
results by 21% compared to the base system. Our results are comparable to
results obtained in similar QE tasks despite the more challenging setting.
