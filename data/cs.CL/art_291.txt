Thematic Annotation: extracting concepts out of documents
Contrarily to standard approaches to topic annotation, the technique used in
this work does not centrally rely on some sort of -- possibly statistical --
keyword extraction. In fact, the proposed annotation algorithm uses a large
scale semantic database -- the EDR Electronic Dictionary -- that provides a
concept hierarchy based on hyponym and hypernym relations. This concept
hierarchy is used to generate a synthetic representation of the document by
aggregating the words present in topically homogeneous document segments into a
set of concepts best preserving the document's content.
  This new extraction technique uses an unexplored approach to topic selection.
Instead of using semantic similarity measures based on a semantic resource, the
later is processed to extract the part of the conceptual hierarchy relevant to
the document content. Then this conceptual hierarchy is searched to extract the
most relevant set of concepts to represent the topics discussed in the
document. Notice that this algorithm is able to extract generic concepts that
are not directly present in the document.
