Construction of a Japanese Word Similarity Dataset
An evaluation of distributed word representation is generally conducted using
a word similarity task and/or a word analogy task. There are many datasets
readily available for these tasks in English. However, evaluating distributed
representation in languages that do not have such resources (e.g., Japanese) is
difficult. Therefore, as a first step toward evaluating distributed
representations in Japanese, we constructed a Japanese word similarity dataset.
To the best of our knowledge, our dataset is the first resource that can be
used to evaluate distributed representations in Japanese. Moreover, our dataset
contains various parts of speech and includes rare words in addition to common
words.
