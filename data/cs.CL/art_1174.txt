Observing Trends in Automated Multilingual Media Analysis
Any large organisation, be it public or private, monitors the media for
information to keep abreast of developments in their field of interest, and
usually also to become aware of positive or negative opinions expressed towards
them. At least for the written media, computer programs have become very
efficient at helping the human analysts significantly in their monitoring task
by gathering media reports, analysing them, detecting trends and - in some
cases - even to issue early warnings or to make predictions of likely future
developments. We present here trend recognition-related functionality of the
Europe Media Monitor (EMM) system, which was developed by the European
Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) for public administrations in the
European Union (EU) and beyond. EMM performs large-scale media analysis in up
to seventy languages and recognises various types of trends, some of them
combining information from news articles written in different languages and
from social media posts. EMM also lets users explore the huge amount of
multilingual media data through interactive maps and graphs, allowing them to
examine the data from various view points and according to multiple criteria. A
lot of EMM's functionality is accessibly freely over the internet or via apps
for hand-held devices.
