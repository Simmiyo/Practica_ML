Recognition and translation Arabic-French of Named Entities: case of the
  Sport places
The recognition of Arabic Named Entities (NE) is a problem in different
domains of Natural Language Processing (NLP) like automatic translation.
Indeed, NE translation allows the access to multilingual in-formation. This
translation doesn't always lead to expected result especially when NE contains
a person name. For this reason and in order to ameliorate translation, we can
transliterate some part of NE. In this context, we propose a method that
integrates translation and transliteration together. We used the linguis-tic
NooJ platform that is based on local grammars and transducers. In this paper,
we focus on sport domain. We will firstly suggest a refinement of the
typological model presented at the MUC Conferences we will describe the
integration of an Arabic transliteration module into translation system.
Finally, we will detail our method and give the results of the evaluation.
