Presenting a New Dataset for the Timeline Generation Problem
The timeline generation task summarises an entity's biography by selecting
stories representing key events from a large pool of relevant documents. This
paper addresses the lack of a standard dataset and evaluative methodology for
the problem. We present and make publicly available a new dataset of 18,793
news articles covering 39 entities. For each entity, we provide a gold standard
timeline and a set of entity-related articles. We propose ROUGE as an
evaluation metric and validate our dataset by showing that top Google results
outperform straw-man baselines.
