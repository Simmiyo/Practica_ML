Articulation rate in Swedish child-directed speech increases as a
  function of the age of the child even when surprisal is controlled for
In earlier work, we have shown that articulation rate in Swedish
child-directed speech (CDS) increases as a function of the age of the child,
even when utterance length and differences in articulation rate between
subjects are controlled for. In this paper we show on utterance level in
spontaneous Swedish speech that i) for the youngest children, articulation rate
in CDS is lower than in adult-directed speech (ADS), ii) there is a significant
negative correlation between articulation rate and surprisal (the negative log
probability) in ADS, and iii) the increase in articulation rate in Swedish CDS
as a function of the age of the child holds, even when surprisal along with
utterance length and differences in articulation rate between speakers are
controlled for. These results indicate that adults adjust their articulation
rate to make it fit the linguistic capacity of the child.
