Extracting Sentiment Attitudes From Analytical Texts
In this paper we present the RuSentRel corpus including analytical texts in
the sphere of international relations. For each document we annotated
sentiments from the author to mentioned named entities, and sentiments of
relations between mentioned entities. In the current experiments, we considered
the problem of extracting sentiment relations between entities for the whole
documents as a three-class machine learning task. We experimented with
conventional machine-learning methods (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest).
