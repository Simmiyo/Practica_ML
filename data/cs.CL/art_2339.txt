Parent Oriented Teacher Selection Causes Language Diversity
An evolutionary model for emergence of diversity in language is developed. We
investigated the effects of two real life observations, namely, people prefer
people that they communicate with well, and people interact with people that
are physically close to each other. Clearly these groups are relatively small
compared to the entire population. We restrict selection of the teachers from
such small groups, called imitation sets, around parents. Then the child learns
language from a teacher selected within the imitation set of her parent. As a
result, there are subcommunities with their own languages developed. Within
subcommunity comprehension is found to be high. The number of languages is
related to the relative size of imitation set by a power law.
