Towards Structural Natural Language Formalization: Mapping Discourse to
  Controlled Natural Language
The author describes a conceptual study towards mapping grounded natural
language discourse representation structures to instances of controlled
language statements. This can be achieved via a pipeline of preexisting state
of the art technologies, namely natural language syntax to semantic discourse
mapping, and a reduction of the latter to controlled language discourse, given
a set of previously learnt reduction rules. Concludingly a description on
evaluation, potential and limitations for ontology-based reasoning is
presented.
