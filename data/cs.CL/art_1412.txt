Prosodic Event Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks with
  Context Information
This paper demonstrates the potential of convolutional neural networks (CNN)
for detecting and classifying prosodic events on words, specifically pitch
accents and phrase boundary tones, from frame-based acoustic features. Typical
approaches use not only feature representations of the word in question but
also its surrounding context. We show that adding position features indicating
the current word benefits the CNN. In addition, this paper discusses the
generalization from a speaker-dependent modelling approach to a
speaker-independent setup. The proposed method is simple and efficient and
yields strong results not only in speaker-dependent but also
speaker-independent cases.
