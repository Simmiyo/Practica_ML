An Anthological Review of Research Utilizing MontyLingua, a Python-Based
  End-to-End Text Processor
MontyLingua, an integral part of ConceptNet which is currently the largest
commonsense knowledge base, is an English text processor developed using Python
programming language in MIT Media Lab. The main feature of MontyLingua is the
coverage for all aspects of English text processing from raw input text to
semantic meanings and summary generation, yet each component in MontyLingua is
loosely-coupled to each other at the architectural and code level, which
enabled individual components to be used independently or substituted. However,
there has been no review exploring the role of MontyLingua in recent research
work utilizing it. This paper aims to review the use of and roles played by
MontyLingua and its components in research work published in 19 articles
between October 2004 and August 2006. We had observed a diversified use of
MontyLingua in many different areas, both generic and domain-specific. Although
the use of text summarizing component had not been observe, we are optimistic
that it will have a crucial role in managing the current trend of information
overload in future research.
