A Formal Framework for Linguistic Annotation
`Linguistic annotation' covers any descriptive or analytic notations applied
to raw language data. The basic data may be in the form of time functions --
audio, video and/or physiological recordings -- or it may be textual. The added
notations may include transcriptions of all sorts (from phonetic features to
discourse structures), part-of-speech and sense tagging, syntactic analysis,
`named entity' identification, co-reference annotation, and so on. While there
are several ongoing efforts to provide formats and tools for such annotations
and to publish annotated linguistic databases, the lack of widely accepted
standards is becoming a critical problem. Proposed standards, to the extent
they exist, have focussed on file formats. This paper focuses instead on the
logical structure of linguistic annotations. We survey a wide variety of
existing annotation formats and demonstrate a common conceptual core, the
annotation graph. This provides a formal framework for constructing,
maintaining and searching linguistic annotations, while remaining consistent
with many alternative data structures and file formats.
