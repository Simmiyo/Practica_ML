Interfacing Constraint-Based Grammars and Generation Algorithms
Constraint-based grammars can, in principle, serve as the major linguistic
knowledge source for both parsing and generation. Surface generation starts
from input semantics representations that may vary across grammars. For many
declarative grammars, the concept of derivation implicitly built in is that of
parsing. They may thus not be interpretable by a generation algorithm. We show
that linguistically plausible semantic analyses can cause severe problems for
semantic-head-driven approaches for generation (SHDG). We use SeReal, a variant
of SHDG and the DISCO grammar of German as our source of examples. We propose a
new, general approach that explicitly accounts for the interface between the
grammar and the generation algorithm by adding a control-oriented layer to the
linguistic knowledge base that reorganizes the semantics in a way suitable for
generation.
