A System for Automated Image Editing from Natural Language Commands
This work presents the task of modifying images in an image editing program
using natural language written commands. We utilize a corpus of over 6000 image
edit text requests to alter real world images collected via crowdsourcing. A
novel framework composed of actions and entities to map a user's natural
language request to executable commands in an image editing program is
described. We resolve previously labeled annotator disagreement through a
voting process and complete annotation of the corpus. We experimented with
different machine learning models and found that the LSTM, the SVM, and the
bidirectional LSTM-CRF joint models are the best to detect image editing
actions and associated entities in a given utterance.
