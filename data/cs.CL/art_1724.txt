Political Speech Generation
In this report we present a system that can generate political speeches for a
desired political party. Furthermore, the system allows to specify whether a
speech should hold a supportive or opposing opinion. The system relies on a
combination of several state-of-the-art NLP methods which are discussed in this
report. These include n-grams, Justeson & Katz POS tag filter, recurrent neural
networks, and latent Dirichlet allocation. Sequences of words are generated
based on probabilities obtained from two underlying models: A language model
takes care of the grammatical correctness while a topic model aims for textual
consistency. Both models were trained on the Convote dataset which contains
transcripts from US congressional floor debates. Furthermore, we present a
manual and an automated approach to evaluate the quality of generated speeches.
In an experimental evaluation generated speeches have shown very high quality
in terms of grammatical correctness and sentence transitions.
