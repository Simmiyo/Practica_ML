A hybrid formalism to parse Sign Languages
Sign Language (SL) linguistic is dependent on the expensive task of
annotating. Some automation is already available for low-level information (eg.
body part tracking) and the lexical level has shown significant progresses. The
syntactic level lacks annotated corpora as well as complete and consistent
models. This article presents a solution for the automatic annotation of SL
syntactic elements. It exposes a formalism able to represent both
constituency-based and dependency-based models. The first enable the
representation the structures one may want to annotate, the second aims at
fulfilling the holes of the first. A parser is presented and used to conduct
two experiments on the solution. One experiment is on a real corpus, the other
is on a synthetic corpus.
