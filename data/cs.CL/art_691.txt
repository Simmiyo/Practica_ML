Semantic Types, Lexical Sorts and Classifiers
We propose a cognitively and linguistically motivated set of sorts for
lexical semantics in a compositional setting: the classifiers in languages that
do have such pronouns. These sorts are needed to include lexical considerations
in a semantical analyser such as Boxer or Grail. Indeed, all proposed lexical
extensions of usual Montague semantics to model restriction of selection,
felicitous and infelicitous copredication require a rich and refined type
system whose base types are the lexical sorts, the basis of the many-sorted
logic in which semantical representations of sentences are stated. However,
none of those approaches define precisely the actual base types or sorts to be
used in the lexicon. In this article, we shall discuss some of the options
commonly adopted by researchers in formal lexical semantics, and defend the
view that classifiers in the languages which have such pronouns are an
appealing solution, both linguistically and cognitively motivated.
