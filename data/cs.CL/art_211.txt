Ellogon: A New Text Engineering Platform
This paper presents Ellogon, a multi-lingual, cross-platform, general-purpose
text engineering environment. Ellogon was designed in order to aid both
researchers in natural language processing, as well as companies that produce
language engineering systems for the end-user. Ellogon provides a powerful
TIPSTER-based infrastructure for managing, storing and exchanging textual data,
embedding and managing text processing components as well as visualising
textual data and their associated linguistic information. Among its key
features are full Unicode support, an extensive multi-lingual graphical user
interface, its modular architecture and the reduced hardware requirements.
