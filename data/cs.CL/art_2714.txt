Geospatial Semantics
Geospatial semantics is a broad field that involves a variety of research
areas. The term semantics refers to the meaning of things, and is in contrast
with the term syntactics. Accordingly, studies on geospatial semantics usually
focus on understanding the meaning of geographic entities as well as their
counterparts in the cognitive and digital world, such as cognitive geographic
concepts and digital gazetteers. Geospatial semantics can also facilitate the
design of geographic information systems (GIS) by enhancing the
interoperability of distributed systems and developing more intelligent
interfaces for user interactions. During the past years, a lot of research has
been conducted, approaching geospatial semantics from different perspectives,
using a variety of methods, and targeting different problems. Meanwhile, the
arrival of big geo data, especially the large amount of unstructured text data
on the Web, and the fast development of natural language processing methods
enable new research directions in geospatial semantics. This chapter,
therefore, provides a systematic review on the existing geospatial semantic
research. Six major research areas are identified and discussed, including
semantic interoperability, digital gazetteers, geographic information
retrieval, geospatial Semantic Web, place semantics, and cognitive geographic
concepts.
