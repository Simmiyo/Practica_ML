Multilingual Cross-domain Perspectives on Online Hate Speech
In this report, we present a study of eight corpora of online hate speech, by
demonstrating the NLP techniques that we used to collect and analyze the
jihadist, extremist, racist, and sexist content. Analysis of the multilingual
corpora shows that the different contexts share certain characteristics in
their hateful rhetoric. To expose the main features, we have focused on text
classification, text profiling, keyword and collocation extraction, along with
manual annotation and qualitative study.
