Evaluation of Computational Grammar Formalisms for Indian Languages
Natural Language Parsing has been the most prominent research area since the
genesis of Natural Language Processing. Probabilistic Parsers are being
developed to make the process of parser development much easier, accurate and
fast. In Indian context, identification of which Computational Grammar
Formalism is to be used is still a question which needs to be answered. In this
paper we focus on this problem and try to analyze different formalisms for
Indian languages.
