All-in-one: Multi-task Learning for Rumour Verification
Automatic resolution of rumours is a challenging task that can be broken down
into smaller components that make up a pipeline, including rumour detection,
rumour tracking and stance classification, leading to the final outcome of
determining the veracity of a rumour. In previous work, these steps in the
process of rumour verification have been developed as separate components where
the output of one feeds into the next. We propose a multi-task learning
approach that allows joint training of the main and auxiliary tasks, improving
the performance of rumour verification. We examine the connection between the
dataset properties and the outcomes of the multi-task learning models used.
