Unsupervised authorship attribution
We describe a technique for attributing parts of a written text to a set of
unknown authors. Nothing is assumed to be known a priori about the writing
styles of potential authors. We use multiple independent clusterings of an
input text to identify parts that are similar and dissimilar to one another. We
describe algorithms necessary to combine the multiple clusterings into a
meaningful output. We show results of the application of the technique on texts
having multiple writing styles.
