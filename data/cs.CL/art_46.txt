Selective Magic HPSG Parsing
We propose a parser for constraint-logic grammars implementing HPSG that
combines the advantages of dynamic bottom-up and advanced top-down control. The
parser allows the user to apply magic compilation to specific constraints in a
grammar which as a result can be processed dynamically in a bottom-up and
goal-directed fashion. State of the art top-down processing techniques are used
to deal with the remaining constraints. We discuss various aspects concerning
the implementation of the parser as part of a grammar development system.
