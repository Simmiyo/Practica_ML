Non-Projective Dependency Parsing with Non-Local Transitions
We present a novel transition system, based on the Covington non-projective
parser, introducing non-local transitions that can directly create arcs
involving nodes to the left of the current focus positions. This avoids the
need for long sequences of No-Arc transitions to create long-distance arcs,
thus alleviating error propagation. The resulting parser outperforms the
original version and achieves the best accuracy on the Stanford Dependencies
conversion of the Penn Treebank among greedy transition-based algorithms.
