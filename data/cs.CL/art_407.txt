Speech Recognition by Machine, A Review
This paper presents a brief survey on Automatic Speech Recognition and
discusses the major themes and advances made in the past 60 years of research,
so as to provide a technological perspective and an appreciation of the
fundamental progress that has been accomplished in this important area of
speech communication. After years of research and development the accuracy of
automatic speech recognition remains one of the important research challenges
(e.g., variations of the context, speakers, and environment).The design of
Speech Recognition system requires careful attentions to the following issues:
Definition of various types of speech classes, speech representation, feature
extraction techniques, speech classifiers, database and performance evaluation.
The problems that are existing in ASR and the various techniques to solve these
problems constructed by various research workers have been presented in a
chronological order. Hence authors hope that this work shall be a contribution
in the area of speech recognition. The objective of this review paper is to
summarize and compare some of the well known methods used in various stages of
speech recognition system and identify research topic and applications which
are at the forefront of this exciting and challenging field.
