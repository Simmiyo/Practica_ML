Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis Using a Two-Step Neural Network
  Architecture
The World Wide Web holds a wealth of information in the form of unstructured
texts such as customer reviews for products, events and more. By extracting and
analyzing the expressed opinions in customer reviews in a fine-grained way,
valuable opportunities and insights for customers and businesses can be gained.
We propose a neural network based system to address the task of Aspect-Based
Sentiment Analysis to compete in Task 2 of the ESWC-2016 Challenge on Semantic
Sentiment Analysis. Our proposed architecture divides the task in two subtasks:
aspect term extraction and aspect-specific sentiment extraction. This approach
is flexible in that it allows to address each subtask independently. As a first
step, a recurrent neural network is used to extract aspects from a text by
framing the problem as a sequence labeling task. In a second step, a recurrent
network processes each extracted aspect with respect to its context and
predicts a sentiment label. The system uses pretrained semantic word embedding
features which we experimentally enhance with semantic knowledge extracted from
WordNet. Further features extracted from SenticNet prove to be beneficial for
the extraction of sentiment labels. As the best performing system in its
category, our proposed system proves to be an effective approach for the
Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis.
