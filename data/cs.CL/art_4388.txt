Paraphrase Thought: Sentence Embedding Module Imitating Human Language
  Recognition
Sentence embedding is an important research topic in natural language
processing. It is essential to generate a good embedding vector that fully
reflects the semantic meaning of a sentence in order to achieve an enhanced
performance for various natural language processing tasks, such as machine
translation and document classification. Thus far, various sentence embedding
models have been proposed, and their feasibility has been demonstrated through
good performances on tasks following embedding, such as sentiment analysis and
sentence classification. However, because the performances of sentence
classification and sentiment analysis can be enhanced by using a simple
sentence representation method, it is not sufficient to claim that these models
fully reflect the meanings of sentences based on good performances for such
tasks. In this paper, inspired by human language recognition, we propose the
following concept of semantic coherence, which should be satisfied for a good
sentence embedding method: similar sentences should be located close to each
other in the embedding space. Then, we propose the Paraphrase-Thought
(P-thought) model to pursue semantic coherence as much as possible.
Experimental results on two paraphrase identification datasets (MS COCO and STS
benchmark) show that the P-thought models outperform the benchmarked sentence
embedding methods.
