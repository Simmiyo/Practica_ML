Fully Automated Fact Checking Using External Sources
Given the constantly growing proliferation of false claims online in recent
years, there has been also a growing research interest in automatically
distinguishing false rumors from factually true claims. Here, we propose a
general-purpose framework for fully-automatic fact checking using external
sources, tapping the potential of the entire Web as a knowledge source to
confirm or reject a claim. Our framework uses a deep neural network with LSTM
text encoding to combine semantic kernels with task-specific embeddings that
encode a claim together with pieces of potentially-relevant text fragments from
the Web, taking the source reliability into account. The evaluation results
show good performance on two different tasks and datasets: (i) rumor detection
and (ii) fact checking of the answers to a question in community question
answering forums.
