Did you take the pill? - Detecting Personal Intake of Medicine from
  Twitter
Mining social media messages such as tweets, articles, and Facebook posts for
health and drug related information has received significant interest in
pharmacovigilance research. Social media sites (e.g., Twitter), have been used
for monitoring drug abuse, adverse reactions of drug usage and analyzing
expression of sentiments related to drugs. Most of these studies are based on
aggregated results from a large population rather than specific sets of
individuals. In order to conduct studies at an individual level or specific
cohorts, identifying posts mentioning intake of medicine by the user is
necessary. Towards this objective we develop a classifier for identifying
mentions of personal intake of medicine in tweets. We train a stacked ensemble
of shallow convolutional neural network (CNN) models on an annotated dataset.
We use random search for tuning the hyper-parameters of the CNN models and
present an ensemble of best models for the prediction task. Our system produces
state-of-the-art result, with a micro-averaged F-score of 0.693. We believe
that the developed classifier has direct uses in the areas of psychology,
health informatics, pharmacovigilance and affective computing for tracking
moods, emotions and sentiments of patients expressing intake of medicine in
social media.
