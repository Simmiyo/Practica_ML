An English-Hindi Code-Mixed Corpus: Stance Annotation and Baseline
  System
Social media has become one of the main channels for peo- ple to communicate
and share their views with the society. We can often detect from these views
whether the person is in favor, against or neu- tral towards a given topic.
These opinions from social media are very useful for various companies. We
present a new dataset that consists of 3545 English-Hindi code-mixed tweets
with opinion towards Demoneti- sation that was implemented in India in 2016
which was followed by a large countrywide debate. We present a baseline
supervised classification system for stance detection developed using the same
dataset that uses various machine learning techniques to achieve an accuracy of
58.7% on 10-fold cross validation.
