Computational Models of Tutor Feedback in Language Acquisition
This paper investigates the role of tutor feedback in language learning using
computational models. We compare two dominant paradigms in language learning:
interactive learning and cross-situational learning - which differ primarily in
the role of social feedback such as gaze or pointing. We analyze the
relationship between these two paradigms and propose a new mixed paradigm that
combines the two paradigms and allows to test algorithms in experiments that
combine no feedback and social feedback. To deal with mixed feedback
experiments, we develop new algorithms and show how they perform with respect
to traditional knn and prototype approaches.
