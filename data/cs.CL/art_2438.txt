BanglaLekha-Isolated: A Comprehensive Bangla Handwritten Character
  Dataset
Bangla handwriting recognition is becoming a very important issue nowadays.
It is potentially a very important task specially for Bangla speaking
population of Bangladesh and West Bengal. By keeping that in our mind we are
introducing a comprehensive Bangla handwritten character dataset named
BanglaLekha-Isolated. This dataset contains Bangla handwritten numerals, basic
characters and compound characters. This dataset was collected from multiple
geographical location within Bangladesh and includes sample collected from a
variety of aged groups. This dataset can also be used for other classification
problems i.e: gender, age, district. This is the largest dataset on Bangla
handwritten characters yet.
