Multi-Task Neural Models for Translating Between Styles Within and
  Across Languages
Generating natural language requires conveying content in an appropriate
style. We explore two related tasks on generating text of varying formality:
monolingual formality transfer and formality-sensitive machine translation. We
propose to solve these tasks jointly using multi-task learning, and show that
our models achieve state-of-the-art performance for formality transfer and are
able to perform formality-sensitive translation without being explicitly
trained on style-annotated translation examples.
