Representation Mapping: A Novel Approach to Generate High-Quality
  Multi-Lingual Emotion Lexicons
In the past years, sentiment analysis has increasingly shifted attention to
representational frameworks more expressive than semantic polarity (being
positive, negative or neutral). However, these richer formats (like Basic
Emotions or Valence-Arousal-Dominance, and variants therefrom), rooted in
psychological research, tend to proliferate the number of representation
schemes for emotion encoding. Thus, a large amount of representationally
incompatible emotion lexicons has been developed by various research groups
adopting one or the other emotion representation format. As a consequence, the
reusability of these resources decreases as does the comparability of systems
using them. In this paper, we propose to solve this dilemma by methods and
tools which map different representation formats onto each other for the sake
of mutual compatibility and interoperability of language resources. We present
the first large-scale investigation of such representation mappings for four
typologically diverse languages and find evidence that our approach produces
(near-)gold quality emotion lexicons, even in cross-lingual settings. Finally,
we use our models to create new lexicons for eight typologically diverse
languages.
