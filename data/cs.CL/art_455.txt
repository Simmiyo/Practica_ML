A statistical learning algorithm for word segmentation
In natural speech, the speaker does not pause between words, yet a human
listener somehow perceives this continuous stream of phonemes as a series of
distinct words. The detection of boundaries between spoken words is an instance
of a general capability of the human neocortex to remember and to recognize
recurring sequences. This paper describes a computer algorithm that is designed
to solve the problem of locating word boundaries in blocks of English text from
which the spaces have been removed. This problem avoids the complexities of
speech processing but requires similar capabilities for detecting recurring
sequences. The algorithm relies entirely on statistical relationships between
letters in the input stream to infer the locations of word boundaries. A
Viterbi trellis is used to simultaneously evaluate a set of hypothetical
segmentations of a block of adjacent words. This technique improves accuracy
but incurs a small latency between the arrival of letters in the input stream
and the sending of words to the output stream. The source code for a C++
version of this algorithm is presented in an appendix.
