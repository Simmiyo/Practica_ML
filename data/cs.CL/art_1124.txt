Morpho-syntactic Lexicon Generation Using Graph-based Semi-supervised
  Learning
Morpho-syntactic lexicons provide information about the morphological and
syntactic roles of words in a language. Such lexicons are not available for all
languages and even when available, their coverage can be limited. We present a
graph-based semi-supervised learning method that uses the morphological,
syntactic and semantic relations between words to automatically construct wide
coverage lexicons from small seed sets. Our method is language-independent, and
we show that we can expand a 1000 word seed lexicon to more than 100 times its
size with high quality for 11 languages. In addition, the automatically created
lexicons provide features that improve performance in two downstream tasks:
morphological tagging and dependency parsing.
