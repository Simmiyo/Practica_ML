An Iterative Transfer Learning Based Ensemble Technique for Automatic
  Short Answer Grading
Automatic short answer grading (ASAG) techniques are designed to
automatically assess short answers to questions in natural language, having a
length of a few words to a few sentences. Supervised ASAG techniques have been
demonstrated to be effective but suffer from a couple of key practical
limitations. They are greatly reliant on instructor provided model answers and
need labeled training data in the form of graded student answers for every
assessment task. To overcome these, in this paper, we introduce an ASAG
technique with two novel features. We propose an iterative technique on an
ensemble of (a) a text classifier of student answers and (b) a classifier using
numeric features derived from various similarity measures with respect to model
answers. Second, we employ canonical correlation analysis based transfer
learning on a common feature representation to build the classifier ensemble
for questions having no labelled data. The proposed technique handsomely beats
all winning supervised entries on the SCIENTSBANK dataset from the Student
Response Analysis task of SemEval 2013. Additionally, we demonstrate
generalizability and benefits of the proposed technique through evaluation on
multiple ASAG datasets from different subject topics and standards.
