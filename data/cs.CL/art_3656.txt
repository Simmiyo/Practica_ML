Distribution-based Prediction of the Degree of Grammaticalization for
  German Prepositions
We test the hypothesis that the degree of grammaticalization of German
prepositions correlates with their corpus-based contextual dispersion measured
by word entropy. We find that there is indeed a moderate correlation for
entropy, but a stronger correlation for frequency and number of context types.
