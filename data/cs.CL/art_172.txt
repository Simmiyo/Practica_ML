Modeling informational novelty in a conversational system with a hybrid
  statistical and grammar-based approach to natural language generation
We present a hybrid statistical and grammar-based system for surface natural
language generation (NLG) that uses grammar rules, conditions on using those
grammar rules, and corpus statistics to determine the word order. We also
describe how this surface NLG module is implemented in a prototype
conversational system, and how it attempts to model informational novelty by
varying the word order. Using a combination of rules and statistical
information, the conversational system expresses the novel information
differently than the given information, based on the run-time dialog state. We
also discuss our plans for evaluating the generation strategy.
