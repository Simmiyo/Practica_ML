Fine Grained Citation Span for References in Wikipedia
\emph{Verifiability} is one of the core editing principles in Wikipedia,
editors being encouraged to provide citations for the added content. For a
Wikipedia article, determining the \emph{citation span} of a citation, i.e.
what content is covered by a citation, is important as it helps decide for
which content citations are still missing.
  We are the first to address the problem of determining the \emph{citation
span} in Wikipedia articles. We approach this problem by classifying which
textual fragments in an article are covered by a citation. We propose a
sequence classification approach where for a paragraph and a citation, we
determine the citation span at a fine-grained level.
  We provide a thorough experimental evaluation and compare our approach
against baselines adopted from the scientific domain, where we show improvement
for all evaluation metrics.
