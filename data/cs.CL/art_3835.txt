The risk of sub-optimal use of Open Source NLP Software: UKB is
  inadvertently state-of-the-art in knowledge-based WSD
UKB is an open source collection of programs for performing, among other
tasks, knowledge-based Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD). Since it was released
in 2009 it has been often used out-of-the-box in sub-optimal settings. We show
that nine years later it is the state-of-the-art on knowledge-based WSD. This
case shows the pitfalls of releasing open source NLP software without optimal
default settings and precise instructions for reproducibility.
