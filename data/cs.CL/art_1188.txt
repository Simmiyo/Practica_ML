Predicate Gradual Logic and Linguistics
There are several major proposals for treating donkey anaphora such as
discourse representation theory and the likes, or E-Type theories and the
likes. Every one of them works well for a set of specific examples that they
use to demonstrate validity of their approaches. As I show in this paper,
however, they are not very generalisable and do not account for essentially the
same problem that they remedy when it manifests in other examples. I propose
another logical approach. I develoop logic that extends a recent, propositional
gradual logic, and show that it can treat donkey anaphora generally. I also
identify and address a problem around the modern convention on existential
import. Furthermore, I show that Aristotle's syllogisms and conversion are
realisable in this logic.
