A World of Difference: Divergent Word Interpretations among People
Divergent word usages reflect differences among people. In this paper, we
present a novel angle for studying word usage divergence -- word
interpretations. We propose an approach that quantifies semantic differences in
interpretations among different groups of people. The effectiveness of our
approach is validated by quantitative evaluations. Experiment results indicate
that divergences in word interpretations exist. We further apply the approach
to two well studied types of differences between people -- gender and region.
The detected words with divergent interpretations reveal the unique features of
specific groups of people. For gender, we discover that certain different
interests, social attitudes, and characters between males and females are
reflected in their divergent interpretations of many words. For region, we find
that specific interpretations of certain words reveal the geographical and
cultural features of different regions.
