Adpositional Supersenses for Mandarin Chinese
This study adapts Semantic Network of Adposition and Case Supersenses (SNACS)
annotation to Mandarin Chinese and demonstrates that the same supersense
categories are appropriate for Chinese adposition semantics. We annotated 15
chapters of The Little Prince, with high interannotator agreement. The parallel
corpus gives insight into differences in construal between the two languages'
adpositions, namely a number of construals that are frequent in Chinese but
rare or unattested in the English corpus. The annotated corpus can further
support automatic disambiguation of adpositions in Chinese, and the common
inventory of supersenses between the two languages can potentially serve
cross-linguistic tasks such as machine translation.
