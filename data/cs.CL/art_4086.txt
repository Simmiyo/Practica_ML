Challenges of language technologies for the indigenous languages of the
  Americas
Indigenous languages of the American continent are highly diverse. However,
they have received little attention from the technological perspective. In this
paper, we review the research, the digital resources and the available NLP
systems that focus on these languages. We present the main challenges and
research questions that arise when distant languages and low-resource scenarios
are faced. We would like to encourage NLP research in linguistically rich and
diverse areas like the Americas.
