Nematus: a Toolkit for Neural Machine Translation
We present Nematus, a toolkit for Neural Machine Translation. The toolkit
prioritizes high translation accuracy, usability, and extensibility. Nematus
has been used to build top-performing submissions to shared translation tasks
at WMT and IWSLT, and has been used to train systems for production
environments.
