A Survey of Named Entity Recognition in Assamese and other Indian
  Languages
Named Entity Recognition is always important when dealing with major Natural
Language Processing tasks such as information extraction, question-answering,
machine translation, document summarization etc so in this paper we put forward
a survey of Named Entities in Indian Languages with particular reference to
Assamese. There are various rule-based and machine learning approaches
available for Named Entity Recognition. At the very first of the paper we give
an idea of the available approaches for Named Entity Recognition and then we
discuss about the related research in this field. Assamese like other Indian
languages is agglutinative and suffers from lack of appropriate resources as
Named Entity Recognition requires large data sets, gazetteer list, dictionary
etc and some useful feature like capitalization as found in English cannot be
found in Assamese. Apart from this we also describe some of the issues faced in
Assamese while doing Named Entity Recognition.
