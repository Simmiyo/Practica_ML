CogALex-V Shared Task: ROOT18
In this paper, we describe ROOT 18, a classifier using the scores of several
unsupervised distributional measures as features to discriminate between
semantically related and unrelated words, and then to classify the related
pairs according to their semantic relation (i.e. synonymy, antonymy, hypernymy,
part-whole meronymy). Our classifier participated in the CogALex-V Shared Task,
showing a solid performance on the first subtask, but a poor performance on the
second subtask. The low scores reported on the second subtask suggest that
distributional measures are not sufficient to discriminate between multiple
semantic relations at once.
