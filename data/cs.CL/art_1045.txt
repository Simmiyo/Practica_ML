Sentiment Uncertainty and Spam in Twitter Streams and Its Implications
  for General Purpose Realtime Sentiment Analysis
State of the art benchmarks for Twitter Sentiment Analysis do not consider
the fact that for more than half of the tweets from the public stream a
distinct sentiment cannot be chosen. This paper provides a new perspective on
Twitter Sentiment Analysis by highlighting the necessity of explicitly
incorporating uncertainty. Moreover, a dataset of high quality to evaluate
solutions for this new problem is introduced and made publicly available.
