Exploring Language Similarities with Dimensionality Reduction Technique
In recent years several novel models were developed to process natural
language, development of accurate language translation systems have helped us
overcome geographical barriers and communicate ideas effectively. These models
are developed mostly for a few languages that are widely used while other
languages are ignored. Most of the languages that are spoken share lexical,
syntactic and sematic similarity with several other languages and knowing this
can help us leverage the existing model to build more specific and accurate
models that can be used for other languages, so here I have explored the idea
of representing several known popular languages in a lower dimension such that
their similarities can be visualized using simple 2 dimensional plots. This can
even help us understand newly discovered languages that may not share its
vocabulary with any of the existing languages.
