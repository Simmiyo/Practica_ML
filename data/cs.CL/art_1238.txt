Scalable Machine Translation in Memory Constrained Environments
Machine translation is the discipline concerned with developing automated
tools for translating from one human language to another. Statistical machine
translation (SMT) is the dominant paradigm in this field. In SMT, translations
are generated by means of statistical models whose parameters are learned from
bilingual data. Scalability is a key concern in SMT, as one would like to make
use of as much data as possible to train better translation systems.
  In recent years, mobile devices with adequate computing power have become
widely available. Despite being very successful, mobile applications relying on
NLP systems continue to follow a client-server architecture, which is of
limited use because access to internet is often limited and expensive. The goal
of this dissertation is to show how to construct a scalable machine translation
system that can operate with the limited resources available on a mobile
device.
  The main challenge for porting translation systems on mobile devices is
memory usage. The amount of memory available on a mobile device is far less
than what is typically available on the server side of a client-server
application. In this thesis, we investigate alternatives for the two components
which prevent standard translation systems from working on mobile devices due
to high memory usage. We show that once these standard components are replaced
with our proposed alternatives, we obtain a scalable translation system that
can work on a device with limited memory.
