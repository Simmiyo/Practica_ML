Combine CRF and MMSEG to Boost Chinese Word Segmentation in Social Media
In this paper, we propose a joint algorithm for the word segmentation on
Chinese social media. Previous work mainly focus on word segmentation for plain
Chinese text, in order to develop a Chinese social media processing tool, we
need to take the main features of social media into account, whose grammatical
structure is not rigorous, and the tendency of using colloquial and Internet
terms makes the existing Chinese-processing tools inefficient to obtain good
performance on social media.
  In our approach, we combine CRF and MMSEG algorithm and extend features of
traditional CRF algorithm to train the model for word segmentation, We use
Internet lexicon in order to improve the performance of our model on Chinese
social media. Our experimental result on Sina Weibo shows that our approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art model.
