Deformable Stacked Structure for Named Entity Recognition
Neural architecture for named entity recognition has achieved great success
in the field of natural language processing. Currently, the dominating
architecture consists of a bi-directional recurrent neural network (RNN) as the
encoder and a conditional random field (CRF) as the decoder. In this paper, we
propose a deformable stacked structure for named entity recognition, in which
the connections between two adjacent layers are dynamically established. We
evaluate the deformable stacked structure by adapting it to different layers.
Our model achieves the state-of-the-art performances on the OntoNotes dataset.
