Did William Shakespeare and Thomas Kyd Write Edward III?
William Shakespeare is believed to be a significant author in the anonymous
play, The Reign of King Edward III, published in 1596. However, recently,
Thomas Kyd, has been suggested as the primary author. Using a neurolinguistics
approach to authorship identification we use a four-feature technique, RPAS, to
convert the 19 scenes in Edward III into a multi-dimensional vector. Three
complementary analytical techniques are applied to cluster the data and reduce
single technique bias before an alternate method, seriation, is used to measure
the distances between clusters and test the strength of the connections. We
find the multivariate techniques robust and are able to allocate up to 14
scenes to Thomas Kyd, and further question if scenes long believed to be
Shakespeare's are not his.
