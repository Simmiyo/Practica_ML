Domain-Specific Sentiment Word Extraction by Seed Expansion and Pattern
  Generation
This paper focuses on the automatic extraction of domain-specific sentiment
word (DSSW), which is a fundamental subtask of sentiment analysis. Most
previous work utilizes manual patterns for this task. However, the performance
of those methods highly relies on the labelled patterns or selected seeds. In
order to overcome the above problem, this paper presents an automatic framework
to detect large-scale domain-specific patterns for DSSW extraction. To this
end, sentiment seeds are extracted from massive dataset of user comments.
Subsequently, these sentiment seeds are expanded by synonyms using a
bootstrapping mechanism. Simultaneously, a synonymy graph is built and the
graph propagation algorithm is applied on the built synonymy graph. Afterwards,
syntactic and sequential relations between target words and high-ranked
sentiment words are extracted automatically to construct large-scale patterns,
which are further used to extracte DSSWs. The experimental results in three
domains reveal the effectiveness of our method.
