An Algorithm Based on Empirical Methods, for Text-to-Tuneful-Speech
  Synthesis of Sanskrit Verse
The rendering of Sanskrit poetry from text to speech is a problem that has
not been solved before. One reason may be the complications in the language
itself. We present unique algorithms based on extensive empirical analysis, to
synthesize speech from a given text input of Sanskrit verses. Using a
pre-recorded audio units database which is itself tremendously reduced in size
compared to the colossal size that would otherwise be required, the algorithms
work on producing the best possible, tunefully rendered chanting of the given
verse. His would enable the visually impaired and those with reading
disabilities to easily access the contents of Sanskrit verses otherwise
available only in writing.
