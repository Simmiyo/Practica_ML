Hybrid Approach to English-Hindi Name Entity Transliteration
Machine translation (MT) research in Indian languages is still in its
infancy. Not much work has been done in proper transliteration of name entities
in this domain. In this paper we address this issue. We have used English-Hindi
language pair for our experiments and have used a hybrid approach. At first we
have processed English words using a rule based approach which extracts
individual phonemes from the words and then we have applied statistical
approach which converts the English into its equivalent Hindi phoneme and in
turn the corresponding Hindi word. Through this approach we have attained
83.40% accuracy.
