Post-Editing Error Correction Algorithm for Speech Recognition using
  Bing Spelling Suggestion
ASR short for Automatic Speech Recognition is the process of converting a
spoken speech into text that can be manipulated by a computer. Although ASR has
several applications, it is still erroneous and imprecise especially if used in
a harsh surrounding wherein the input speech is of low quality. This paper
proposes a post-editing ASR error correction method and algorithm based on
Bing's online spelling suggestion. In this approach, the ASR recognized output
text is spell-checked using Bing's spelling suggestion technology to detect and
correct misrecognized words. More specifically, the proposed algorithm breaks
down the ASR output text into several word-tokens that are submitted as search
queries to Bing search engine. A returned spelling suggestion implies that a
query is misspelled; and thus it is replaced by the suggested correction;
otherwise, no correction is performed and the algorithm continues with the next
token until all tokens get validated. Experiments carried out on various
speeches in different languages indicated a successful decrease in the number
of ASR errors and an improvement in the overall error correction rate. Future
research can improve upon the proposed algorithm so much so that it can be
parallelized to take advantage of multiprocessor computers.
