Stance and Sentiment in Tweets
We can often detect from a person's utterances whether he/she is in favor of
or against a given target entity -- their stance towards the target. However, a
person may express the same stance towards a target by using negative or
positive language. Here for the first time we present a dataset of
tweet--target pairs annotated for both stance and sentiment. The targets may or
may not be referred to in the tweets, and they may or may not be the target of
opinion in the tweets. Partitions of this dataset were used as training and
test sets in a SemEval-2016 shared task competition. We propose a simple stance
detection system that outperforms submissions from all 19 teams that
participated in the shared task. Additionally, access to both stance and
sentiment annotations allows us to explore several research questions. We show
that while knowing the sentiment expressed by a tweet is beneficial for stance
classification, it alone is not sufficient. Finally, we use additional
unlabeled data through distant supervision techniques and word embeddings to
further improve stance classification.
