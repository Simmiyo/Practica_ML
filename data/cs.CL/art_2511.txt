Baselines and test data for cross-lingual inference
The recent years have seen a revival of interest in textual entailment,
sparked by i) the emergence of powerful deep neural network learners for
natural language processing and ii) the timely development of large-scale
evaluation datasets such as SNLI. Recast as natural language inference, the
problem now amounts to detecting the relation between pairs of statements: they
either contradict or entail one another, or they are mutually neutral. Current
research in natural language inference is effectively exclusive to English. In
this paper, we propose to advance the research in SNLI-style natural language
inference toward multilingual evaluation. To that end, we provide test data for
four major languages: Arabic, French, Spanish, and Russian. We experiment with
a set of baselines. Our systems are based on cross-lingual word embeddings and
machine translation. While our best system scores an average accuracy of just
over 75%, we focus largely on enabling further research in multilingual
inference.
