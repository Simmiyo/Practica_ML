Three New Methods for Evaluating Reference Resolution
Reference resolution on extended texts (several thousand references) cannot
be evaluated manually. An evaluation algorithm has been proposed for the MUC
tests, using equivalence classes for the coreference relation. However, we show
here that this algorithm is too indulgent, yielding good scores even for poor
resolution strategies. We elaborate on the same formalism to propose two new
evaluation algorithms, comparing them first with the MUC algorithm and giving
then results on a variety of examples. A third algorithm using only
distributional comparison of equivalence classes is finally described; it
assesses the relative importance of the recall vs. precision errors.
