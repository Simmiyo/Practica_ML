Predicting Disease-Gene Associations using Cross-Document Graph-based
  Features
In the context of personalized medicine, text mining methods pose an
interesting option for identifying disease-gene associations, as they can be
used to generate novel links between diseases and genes which may complement
knowledge from structured databases. The most straightforward approach to
extract such links from text is to rely on a simple assumption postulating an
association between all genes and diseases that co-occur within the same
document. However, this approach (i) tends to yield a number of spurious
associations, (ii) does not capture different relevant types of associations,
and (iii) is incapable of aggregating knowledge that is spread across
documents. Thus, we propose an approach in which disease-gene co-occurrences
and gene-gene interactions are represented in an RDF graph. A machine
learning-based classifier is trained that incorporates features extracted from
the graph to separate disease-gene pairs into valid disease-gene associations
and spurious ones. On the manually curated Genetic Testing Registry, our
approach yields a 30 points increase in F1 score over a plain co-occurrence
baseline.
