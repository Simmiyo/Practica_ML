A Trolling Hierarchy in Social Media and A Conditional Random Field For
  Trolling Detection
An-ever increasing number of social media websites, electronic newspapers and
Internet forums allow visitors to leave comments for others to read and
interact. This exchange is not free from participants with malicious
intentions, which do not contribute with the written conversation. Among
different communities users adopt strategies to handle such users. In this
paper we present a comprehensive categorization of the trolling phenomena
resource, inspired by politeness research and propose a model that jointly
predicts four crucial aspects of trolling: intention, interpretation, intention
disclosure and response strategy. Finally, we present a new annotated dataset
containing excerpts of conversations involving trolls and the interactions with
other users that we hope will be a useful resource for the research community.
