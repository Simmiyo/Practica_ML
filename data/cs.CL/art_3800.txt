Russian word sense induction by clustering averaged word embeddings
The paper reports our participation in the shared task on word sense
induction and disambiguation for the Russian language (RUSSE-2018). Our team
was ranked 2nd for the wiki-wiki dataset (containing mostly homonyms) and 5th
for the bts-rnc and active-dict datasets (containing mostly polysemous words)
among all 19 participants.
  The method we employed was extremely naive. It implied representing contexts
of ambiguous words as averaged word embedding vectors, using off-the-shelf
pre-trained distributional models. Then, these vector representations were
clustered with mainstream clustering techniques, thus producing the groups
corresponding to the ambiguous word senses. As a side result, we show that word
embedding models trained on small but balanced corpora can be superior to those
trained on large but noisy data - not only in intrinsic evaluation, but also in
downstream tasks like word sense induction.
