Correction of Errors in a Modality Corpus Used for Machine Translation
  by Using Machine-learning Method
We performed corpus correction on a modality corpus for machine translation
by using such machine-learning methods as the maximum-entropy method. We thus
constructed a high-quality modality corpus based on corpus correction. We
compared several kinds of methods for corpus correction in our experiments and
developed a good method for corpus correction.
