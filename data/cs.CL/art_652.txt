DGT-TM: A freely Available Translation Memory in 22 Languages
The European Commission's (EC) Directorate General for Translation, together
with the EC's Joint Research Centre, is making available a large translation
memory (TM; i.e. sentences and their professionally produced translations)
covering twenty-two official European Union (EU) languages and their 231
language pairs. Such a resource is typically used by translation professionals
in combination with TM software to improve speed and consistency of their
translations. However, this resource has also many uses for translation studies
and for language technology applications, including Statistical Machine
Translation (SMT), terminology extraction, Named Entity Recognition (NER),
multilingual classification and clustering, and many more. In this reference
paper for DGT-TM, we introduce this new resource, provide statistics regarding
its size, and explain how it was produced and how to use it.
