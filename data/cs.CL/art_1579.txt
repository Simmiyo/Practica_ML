Crowdsourcing Question-Answer Meaning Representations
We introduce Question-Answer Meaning Representations (QAMRs), which represent
the predicate-argument structure of a sentence as a set of question-answer
pairs. We also develop a crowdsourcing scheme to show that QAMRs can be labeled
with very little training, and gather a dataset with over 5,000 sentences and
100,000 questions. A detailed qualitative analysis demonstrates that the
crowd-generated question-answer pairs cover the vast majority of
predicate-argument relationships in existing datasets (including PropBank,
NomBank, QA-SRL, and AMR) along with many previously under-resourced ones,
including implicit arguments and relations. The QAMR data and annotation code
is made publicly available to enable future work on how best to model these
complex phenomena.
