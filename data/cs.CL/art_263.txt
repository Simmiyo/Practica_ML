A Cross-media Retrieval System for Lecture Videos
We propose a cross-media lecture-on-demand system, in which users can
selectively view specific segments of lecture videos by submitting text
queries. Users can easily formulate queries by using the textbook associated
with a target lecture, even if they cannot come up with effective keywords. Our
system extracts the audio track from a target lecture video, generates a
transcription by large vocabulary continuous speech recognition, and produces a
text index. Experimental results showed that by adapting speech recognition to
the topic of the lecture, the recognition accuracy increased and the retrieval
accuracy was comparable with that obtained by human transcription.
