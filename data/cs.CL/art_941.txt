CCG Parsing and Multiword Expressions
This thesis presents a study about the integration of information about
Multiword Expressions (MWEs) into parsing with Combinatory Categorial Grammar
(CCG). We build on previous work which has shown the benefit of adding
information about MWEs to syntactic parsing by implementing a similar pipeline
with CCG parsing. More specifically, we collapse MWEs to one token in training
and test data in CCGbank, a corpus which contains sentences annotated with CCG
derivations. Our collapsing algorithm however can only deal with MWEs when they
form a constituent in the data which is one of the limitations of our approach.
  We study the effect of collapsing training and test data. A parsing effect
can be obtained if collapsed data help the parser in its decisions and a
training effect can be obtained if training on the collapsed data improves
results. We also collapse the gold standard and show that our model
significantly outperforms the baseline model on our gold standard, which
indicates that there is a training effect. We show that the baseline model
performs significantly better on our gold standard when the data are collapsed
before parsing than when the data are collapsed after parsing which indicates
that there is a parsing effect. We show that these results can lead to improved
performance on the non-collapsed standard benchmark although we fail to show
that it does so significantly. We conclude that despite the limited settings,
there are noticeable improvements from using MWEs in parsing. We discuss ways
in which the incorporation of MWEs into parsing can be improved and hypothesize
that this will lead to more substantial results.
  We finally show that turning the MWE recognition part of the pipeline into an
experimental part is a useful thing to do as we obtain different results with
different recognizers.
