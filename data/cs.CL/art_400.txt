A Discourse-based Approach in Text-based Machine Translation
This paper presents a theoretical research based approach to ellipsis
resolution in machine translation. The formula of discourse is applied in order
to resolve ellipses. The validity of the discourse formula is analyzed by
applying it to the real world text, i.e., newspaper fragments. The source text
is converted into mono-sentential discourses where complex discourses require
further dissection either directly into primitive discourses or first into
compound discourses and later into primitive ones. The procedure of dissection
needs further improvement, i.e., discovering as many primitive discourse forms
as possible. An attempt has been made to investigate new primitive discourses
or patterns from the given text.
