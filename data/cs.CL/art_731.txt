Machine Learning of Phonologically Conditioned Noun Declensions For
  Tamil Morphological Generators
This paper presents machine learning solutions to a practical problem of
Natural Language Generation (NLG), particularly the word formation in
agglutinative languages like Tamil, in a supervised manner. The morphological
generator is an important component of Natural Language Processing in
Artificial Intelligence. It generates word forms given a root and affixes. The
morphophonemic changes like addition, deletion, alternation etc., occur when
two or more morphemes or words joined together. The Sandhi rules should be
explicitly specified in the rule based morphological analyzers and generators.
In machine learning framework, these rules can be learned automatically by the
system from the training samples and subsequently be applied for new inputs. In
this paper we proposed the machine learning models which learn the
morphophonemic rules for noun declensions from the given training data. These
models are trained to learn sandhi rules using various learning algorithms and
the performance of those algorithms are presented. From this we conclude that
machine learning of morphological processing such as word form generation can
be successfully learned in a supervised manner, without explicit description of
rules. The performance of Decision trees and Bayesian machine learning
algorithms on noun declensions are discussed.
