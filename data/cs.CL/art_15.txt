Translating near-synonyms: Possibilities and preferences in the
  interlingua
This paper argues that an interlingual representation must explicitly
represent some parts of the meaning of a situation as possibilities (or
preferences), not as necessary or definite components of meaning (or
constraints). Possibilities enable the analysis and generation of nuance,
something required for faithful translation. Furthermore, the representation of
the meaning of words, especially of near-synonyms, is crucial, because it
specifies which nuances words can convey in which contexts.
