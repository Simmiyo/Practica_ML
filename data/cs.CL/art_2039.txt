Authorship clustering using multi-headed recurrent neural networks
A recurrent neural network that has been trained to separately model the
language of several documents by unknown authors is used to measure similarity
between the documents. It is able to find clues of common authorship even when
the documents are very short and about disparate topics. While it is easy to
make statistically significant predictions regarding authorship, it is
difficult to group documents into definite clusters with high accuracy.
