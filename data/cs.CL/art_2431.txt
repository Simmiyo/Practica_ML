Question Answering from Unstructured Text by Retrieval and Comprehension
Open domain Question Answering (QA) systems must interact with external
knowledge sources, such as web pages, to find relevant information. Information
sources like Wikipedia, however, are not well structured and difficult to
utilize in comparison with Knowledge Bases (KBs). In this work we present a
two-step approach to question answering from unstructured text, consisting of a
retrieval step and a comprehension step. For comprehension, we present an RNN
based attention model with a novel mixture mechanism for selecting answers from
either retrieved articles or a fixed vocabulary. For retrieval we introduce a
hand-crafted model and a neural model for ranking relevant articles. We achieve
state-of-the-art performance on W IKI M OVIES dataset, reducing the error by
40%. Our experimental results further demonstrate the importance of each of the
introduced components.
