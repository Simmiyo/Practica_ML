Neural and Statistical Methods for Leveraging Meta-information in
  Machine Translation
In this paper, we discuss different methods which use meta information and
richer context that may accompany source language input to improve machine
translation quality. We focus on category information of input text as meta
information, but the proposed methods can be extended to all textual and
non-textual meta information that might be available for the input text or
automatically predicted using the text content. The main novelty of this work
is to use state-of-the-art neural network methods to tackle this problem within
a statistical machine translation (SMT) framework. We observe translation
quality improvements up to 3% in terms of BLEU score in some text categories.
