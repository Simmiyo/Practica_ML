Modeling Trolling in Social Media Conversations
Social media websites, electronic newspapers and Internet forums allow
visitors to leave comments for others to read and interact. This exchange is
not free from participants with malicious intentions, who troll others by
positing messages that are intended to be provocative, offensive, or menacing.
With the goal of facilitating the computational modeling of trolling, we
propose a trolling categorization that is novel in the sense that it allows
comment-based analysis from both the trolls' and the responders' perspectives,
characterizing these two perspectives using four aspects, namely, the troll's
intention and his intention disclosure, as well as the responder's
interpretation of the troll's intention and her response strategy. Using this
categorization, we annotate and release a dataset containing excerpts of Reddit
conversations involving suspected trolls and their interactions with other
users. Finally, we identify the difficult-to-classify cases in our corpus and
suggest potential solutions for them.
