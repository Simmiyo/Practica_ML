Fighting with the Sparsity of Synonymy Dictionaries
Graph-based synset induction methods, such as MaxMax and Watset, induce
synsets by performing a global clustering of a synonymy graph. However, such
methods are sensitive to the structure of the input synonymy graph: sparseness
of the input dictionary can substantially reduce the quality of the extracted
synsets. In this paper, we propose two different approaches designed to
alleviate the incompleteness of the input dictionaries. The first one performs
a pre-processing of the graph by adding missing edges, while the second one
performs a post-processing by merging similar synset clusters. We evaluate
these approaches on two datasets for the Russian language and discuss their
impact on the performance of synset induction methods. Finally, we perform an
extensive error analysis of each approach and discuss prominent alternative
methods for coping with the problem of the sparsity of the synonymy
dictionaries.
