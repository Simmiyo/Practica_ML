Machine Translation of Low-Resource Spoken Dialects: Strategies for
  Normalizing Swiss German
The goal of this work is to design a machine translation (MT) system for a
low-resource family of dialects, collectively known as Swiss German, which are
widely spoken in Switzerland but seldom written. We collected a significant
number of parallel written resources to start with, up to a total of about 60k
words. Moreover, we identified several other promising data sources for Swiss
German. Then, we designed and compared three strategies for normalizing Swiss
German input in order to address the regional diversity. We found that
character-based neural MT was the best solution for text normalization. In
combination with phrase-based statistical MT, our solution reached 36% BLEU
score when translating from the Bernese dialect. This value, however, decreases
as the testing data becomes more remote from the training one, geographically
and topically. These resources and normalization techniques are a first step
towards full MT of Swiss German dialects.
