Statistical Machine Translation for Indian Languages: Mission Hindi 2
This paper presents Centre for Development of Advanced Computing Mumbai's
(CDACM) submission to NLP Tools Contest on Statistical Machine Translation in
Indian Languages (ILSMT) 2015 (collocated with ICON 2015). The aim of the
contest was to collectively explore the effectiveness of Statistical Machine
Translation (SMT) while translating within Indian languages and between English
and Indian languages. In this paper, we report our work on all five language
pairs, namely Bengali-Hindi (\bnhi), Marathi-Hindi (\mrhi), Tamil-Hindi
(\tahi), Telugu-Hindi (\tehi), and English-Hindi (\enhi) for Health, Tourism,
and General domains. We have used suffix separation, compound splitting and
preordering prior to SMT training and testing.
