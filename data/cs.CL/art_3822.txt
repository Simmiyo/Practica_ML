SlugNERDS: A Named Entity Recognition Tool for Open Domain Dialogue
  Systems
In dialogue systems, the tasks of named entity recognition (NER) and named
entity linking (NEL) are vital preprocessing steps for understanding user
intent, especially in open domain interaction where we cannot rely on
domain-specific inference. UCSC's effort as one of the funded teams in the 2017
Amazon Alexa Prize Contest has yielded Slugbot, an open domain social bot,
aimed at casual conversation. We discovered several challenges specifically
associated with both NER and NEL when building Slugbot, such as that the NE
labels are too coarse-grained or the entity types are not linked to a useful
ontology. Moreover, we have discovered that traditional approaches do not
perform well in our context: even systems designed to operate on tweets or
other social media data do not work well in dialogue systems. In this paper, we
introduce Slugbot's Named Entity Recognition for dialogue Systems (SlugNERDS),
a NER and NEL tool which is optimized to address these issues. We describe two
new resources that we are building as part of this work: SlugEntityDB and
SchemaActuator. We believe these resources will be useful for the research
community.
