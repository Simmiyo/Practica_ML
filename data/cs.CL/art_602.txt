Automatic Detection of Non-deverbal Event Nouns for Quick Lexicon
  Production
In this work we present the results of our experimental work on the
develop-ment of lexical class-based lexica by automatic means. The objective is
to as-sess the use of linguistic lexical-class based information as a feature
selection methodology for the use of classifiers in quick lexical development.
The results show that the approach can help in re-ducing the human effort
required in the development of language resources sig-nificantly.
