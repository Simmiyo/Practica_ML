Dataset Construction via Attention for Aspect Term Extraction with
  Distant Supervision
Aspect Term Extraction (ATE) detects opinionated aspect terms in sentences or
text spans, with the end goal of performing aspect-based sentiment analysis.
The small amount of available datasets for supervised ATE and the fact that
they cover only a few domains raise the need for exploiting other data sources
in new and creative ways. Publicly available review corpora contain a plethora
of opinionated aspect terms and cover a larger domain spectrum. In this paper,
we first propose a method for using such review corpora for creating a new
dataset for ATE. Our method relies on an attention mechanism to select
sentences that have a high likelihood of containing actual opinionated aspects.
We thus improve the quality of the extracted aspects. We then use the
constructed dataset to train a model and perform ATE with distant supervision.
By evaluating on human annotated datasets, we prove that our method achieves a
significantly improved performance over various unsupervised and supervised
baselines. Finally, we prove that sentence selection matters when it comes to
creating new datasets for ATE. Specifically, we show that, using a set of
selected sentences leads to higher ATE performance compared to using the whole
sentence set.
