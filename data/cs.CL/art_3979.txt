UG18 at SemEval-2018 Task 1: Generating Additional Training Data for
  Predicting Emotion Intensity in Spanish
The present study describes our submission to SemEval 2018 Task 1: Affect in
Tweets. Our Spanish-only approach aimed to demonstrate that it is beneficial to
automatically generate additional training data by (i) translating training
data from other languages and (ii) applying a semi-supervised learning method.
We find strong support for both approaches, with those models outperforming our
regular models in all subtasks. However, creating a stepwise ensemble of
different models as opposed to simply averaging did not result in an increase
in performance. We placed second (EI-Reg), second (EI-Oc), fourth (V-Reg) and
fifth (V-Oc) in the four Spanish subtasks we participated in.
