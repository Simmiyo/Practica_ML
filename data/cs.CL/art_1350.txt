Improving Reliability of Word Similarity Evaluation by Redesigning
  Annotation Task and Performance Measure
We suggest a new method for creating and using gold-standard datasets for
word similarity evaluation. Our goal is to improve the reliability of the
evaluation, and we do this by redesigning the annotation task to achieve higher
inter-rater agreement, and by defining a performance measure which takes the
reliability of each annotation decision in the dataset into account.
