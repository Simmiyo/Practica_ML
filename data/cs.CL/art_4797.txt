An Incremental Iterated Response Model of Pragmatics
Recent Iterated Response (IR) models of pragmatics conceptualize language use
as a recursive process in which agents reason about each other to increase
communicative efficiency. These models are generally defined over complete
utterances. However, there is substantial evidence that pragmatic reasoning
takes place incrementally during production and comprehension. We address this
with an incremental IR model. We compare the incremental and global versions
using computational simulations, and we assess the incremental model against
existing experimental data and in the TUNA corpus for referring expression
generation, showing that the model can capture phenomena out of reach of global
versions.
