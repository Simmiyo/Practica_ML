Prefix Probabilities from Stochastic Tree Adjoining Grammars
Language models for speech recognition typically use a probability model of
the form Pr(a_n | a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n-1}). Stochastic grammars, on the other
hand, are typically used to assign structure to utterances. A language model of
the above form is constructed from such grammars by computing the prefix
probability Sum_{w in Sigma*} Pr(a_1 ... a_n w), where w represents all
possible terminations of the prefix a_1 ... a_n. The main result in this paper
is an algorithm to compute such prefix probabilities given a stochastic Tree
Adjoining Grammar (TAG). The algorithm achieves the required computation in
O(n^6) time. The probability of subderivations that do not derive any words in
the prefix, but contribute structurally to its derivation, are precomputed to
achieve termination. This algorithm enables existing corpus-based estimation
techniques for stochastic TAGs to be used for language modelling.
