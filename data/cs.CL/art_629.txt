Clustering Algorithm for Gujarati Language
Natural language processing area is still under research. But now a day it is
on platform for worldwide researchers. Natural language processing includes
analyzing the language based on its structure and then tagging of each word
appropriately with its grammar base. Here we have 50,000 tagged words set and
we try to cluster those Gujarati words based on proposed algorithm, we have
defined our own algorithm for processing. Many clustering techniques are
available Ex. Single linkage, complete, linkage,average linkage, Hear no of
clusters to be formed are not known, so it is all depends on the type of data
set provided . Clustering is preprocess for stemming . Stemming is the process
where root is extracted from its word. Ex. cats= cat+S, meaning. Cat: Noun and
plural form.
