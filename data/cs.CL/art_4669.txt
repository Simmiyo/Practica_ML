Towards JointUD: Part-of-speech Tagging and Lemmatization using
  Recurrent Neural Networks
This paper describes our submission to CoNLL 2018 UD Shared Task. We have
extended an LSTM-based neural network designed for sequence tagging to
additionally generate character-level sequences. The network was jointly
trained to produce lemmas, part-of-speech tags and morphological features.
Sentence segmentation, tokenization and dependency parsing were handled by
UDPipe 1.2 baseline. The results demonstrate the viability of the proposed
multitask architecture, although its performance still remains far from
state-of-the-art.
