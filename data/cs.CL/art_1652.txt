D-Bees: A Novel Method Inspired by Bee Colony Optimization for Solving
  Word Sense Disambiguation
Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is a problem in the field of computational
linguistics given as finding the intended sense of a word (or a set of words)
when it is activated within a certain context. WSD was recently addressed as a
combinatorial optimization problem in which the goal is to find a sequence of
senses that maximize the semantic relatedness among the target words. In this
article, a novel algorithm for solving the WSD problem called D-Bees is
proposed which is inspired by bee colony optimization (BCO)where artificial bee
agents collaborate to solve the problem. The D-Bees algorithm is evaluated on a
standard dataset (SemEval 2007 coarse-grained English all-words task corpus)and
is compared to simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, and two ant colony
optimization techniques (ACO). It will be observed that the BCO and ACO
approaches are on par.
