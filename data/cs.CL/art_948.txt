Representing Meaning with a Combination of Logical and Distributional
  Models
NLP tasks differ in the semantic information they require, and at this time
no single se- mantic representation fulfills all requirements. Logic-based
representations characterize sentence structure, but do not capture the graded
aspect of meaning. Distributional models give graded similarity ratings for
words and phrases, but do not capture sentence structure in the same detail as
logic-based approaches. So it has been argued that the two are complementary.
We adopt a hybrid approach that combines logic-based and distributional
semantics through probabilistic logic inference in Markov Logic Networks
(MLNs). In this paper, we focus on the three components of a practical system
integrating logical and distributional models: 1) Parsing and task
representation is the logic-based part where input problems are represented in
probabilistic logic. This is quite different from representing them in standard
first-order logic. 2) For knowledge base construction we form weighted
inference rules. We integrate and compare distributional information with other
sources, notably WordNet and an existing paraphrase collection. In particular,
we use our system to evaluate distributional lexical entailment approaches. We
use a variant of Robinson resolution to determine the necessary inference
rules. More sources can easily be added by mapping them to logical rules; our
system learns a resource-specific weight that corrects for scaling differences
between resources. 3) In discussing probabilistic inference, we show how to
solve the inference problems efficiently. To evaluate our approach, we use the
task of textual entailment (RTE), which can utilize the strengths of both
logic-based and distributional representations. In particular we focus on the
SICK dataset, where we achieve state-of-the-art results.
