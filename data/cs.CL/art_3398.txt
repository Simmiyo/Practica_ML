Improving Retrieval Modeling Using Cross Convolution Networks And Multi
  Frequency Word Embedding
To build a satisfying chatbot that has the ability of managing a
goal-oriented multi-turn dialogue, accurate modeling of human conversation is
crucial. In this paper we concentrate on the task of response selection for
multi-turn human-computer conversation with a given context. Previous
approaches show weakness in capturing information of rare keywords that appear
in either or both context and correct response, and struggle with long input
sequences. We propose Cross Convolution Network (CCN) and Multi Frequency word
embedding to address both problems. We train several models using the Ubuntu
Dialogue dataset which is the largest freely available multi-turn based
dialogue corpus. We further build an ensemble model by averaging predictions of
multiple models. We achieve a new state-of-the-art on this dataset with
considerable improvements compared to previous best results.
