Multilingual lexicon design tool and database management system for MT
The paper presents the design and development of English-Lithuanian-English
dictionarylexicon tool and lexicon database management system for MT. The
system is oriented to support two main requirements: to be open to the user and
to describe much more attributes of speech parts as a regular dictionary that
are required for the MT. Programming language Java and database management
system MySql is used to implement the designing tool and lexicon database
respectively. This solution allows easily deploying this system in the
Internet. The system is able to run on various OS such as: Windows, Linux, Mac
and other OS where Java Virtual Machine is supported. Since the modern lexicon
database managing system is used, it is not a problem accessing the same
database for several users.
