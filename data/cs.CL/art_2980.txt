Leveraging Discourse Information Effectively for Authorship Attribution
We explore techniques to maximize the effectiveness of discourse information
in the task of authorship attribution. We present a novel method to embed
discourse features in a Convolutional Neural Network text classifier, which
achieves a state-of-the-art result by a substantial margin. We empirically
investigate several featurization methods to understand the conditions under
which discourse features contribute non-trivial performance gains, and analyze
discourse embeddings.
