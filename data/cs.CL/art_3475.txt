Hate Speech Detection: A Solved Problem? The Challenging Case of Long
  Tail on Twitter
In recent years, the increasing propagation of hate speech on social media
and the urgent need for effective counter-measures have drawn significant
investment from governments, companies, and researchers. A large number of
methods have been developed for automated hate speech detection online. This
aims to classify textual content into non-hate or hate speech, in which case
the method may also identify the targeting characteristics (i.e., types of
hate, such as race, and religion) in the hate speech. However, we notice
significant difference between the performance of the two (i.e., non-hate v.s.
hate). In this work, we argue for a focus on the latter problem for practical
reasons. We show that it is a much more challenging task, as our analysis of
the language in the typical datasets shows that hate speech lacks unique,
discriminative features and therefore is found in the 'long tail' in a dataset
that is difficult to discover. We then propose Deep Neural Network structures
serving as feature extractors that are particularly effective for capturing the
semantics of hate speech. Our methods are evaluated on the largest collection
of hate speech datasets based on Twitter, and are shown to be able to
outperform the best performing method by up to 5 percentage points in
macro-average F1, or 8 percentage points in the more challenging case of
identifying hateful content.
