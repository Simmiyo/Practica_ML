A Flexible Shallow Approach to Text Generation
In order to support the efficient development of NL generation systems, two
orthogonal methods are currently pursued with emphasis: (1) reusable, general,
and linguistically motivated surface realization components, and (2) simple,
task-oriented template-based techniques. In this paper we argue that, from an
application-oriented perspective, the benefits of both are still limited. In
order to improve this situation, we suggest and evaluate shallow generation
methods associated with increased flexibility. We advise a close connection
between domain-motivated and linguistic ontologies that supports the quick
adaptation to new tasks and domains, rather than the reuse of general
resources. Our method is especially designed for generating reports with
limited linguistic variations.
