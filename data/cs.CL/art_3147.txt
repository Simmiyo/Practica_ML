BKTreebank: Building a Vietnamese Dependency Treebank
Dependency treebank is an important resource in any language. In this paper,
we present our work on building BKTreebank, a dependency treebank for
Vietnamese. Important points on designing POS tagset, dependency relations, and
annotation guidelines are discussed. We describe experiments on POS tagging and
dependency parsing on the treebank. Experimental results show that the treebank
is a useful resource for Vietnamese language processing.
