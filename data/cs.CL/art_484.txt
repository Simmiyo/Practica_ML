Data formats for phonological corpora
The goal of the present chapter is to explore the possibility of providing
the research (but also the industrial) community that commonly uses spoken
corpora with a stable portfolio of well-documented standardised formats that
allow a high re-use rate of annotated spoken resources and, as a consequence,
better interoperability across tools used to produce or exploit such resources.
