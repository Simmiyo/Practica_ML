Exploiting Sublanguage and Domain Characteristics in a Bootstrapping
  Approach to Lexicon and Ontology Creation
It is very costly to build up lexical resources and domain ontologies.
Especially when confronted with a new application domain lexical gaps and a
poor coverage of domain concepts are a problem for the successful exploitation
of natural language document analysis systems that need and exploit such
knowledge sources. In this paper we report about ongoing experiments with
`bootstrapping techniques' for lexicon and ontology creation.
