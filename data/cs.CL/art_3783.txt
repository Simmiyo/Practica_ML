Transformation Networks for Target-Oriented Sentiment Classification
Target-oriented sentiment classification aims at classifying sentiment
polarities over individual opinion targets in a sentence. RNN with attention
seems a good fit for the characteristics of this task, and indeed it achieves
the state-of-the-art performance. After re-examining the drawbacks of attention
mechanism and the obstacles that block CNN to perform well in this
classification task, we propose a new model to overcome these issues. Instead
of attention, our model employs a CNN layer to extract salient features from
the transformed word representations originated from a bi-directional RNN
layer. Between the two layers, we propose a component to generate
target-specific representations of words in the sentence, meanwhile incorporate
a mechanism for preserving the original contextual information from the RNN
layer. Experiments show that our model achieves a new state-of-the-art
performance on a few benchmarks.
