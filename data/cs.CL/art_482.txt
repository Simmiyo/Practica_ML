Object-oriented semantics of English in natural language understanding
  system
A new approach to the problem of natural language understanding is proposed.
The knowledge domain under consideration is the social behavior of people.
English sentences are translated into set of predicates of a semantic database,
which describe persons, occupations, organizations, projects, actions, events,
messages, machines, things, animals, location and time of actions, relations
between objects, thoughts, cause-and-effect relations, abstract objects. There
is a knowledge base containing the description of semantics of objects
(functions and structure), actions (motives and causes), and operations.
