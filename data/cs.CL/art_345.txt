Graph Algorithms for Improving Type-Logical Proof Search
Proof nets are a graph theoretical representation of proofs in various
fragments of type-logical grammar. In spite of this basis in graph theory,
there has been relatively little attention to the use of graph theoretic
algorithms for type-logical proof search. In this paper we will look at several
ways in which standard graph theoretic algorithms can be used to restrict the
search space. In particular, we will provide an O(n4) algorithm for selecting
an optimal axiom link at any stage in the proof search as well as a O(kn3)
algorithm for selecting the k best proof candidates.
