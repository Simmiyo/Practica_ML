Preparing Korean Data for the Shared Task on Parsing Morphologically
  Rich Languages
This document gives a brief description of Korean data prepared for the SPMRL
2013 shared task. A total of 27,363 sentences with 350,090 tokens are used for
the shared task. All constituent trees are collected from the KAIST Treebank
and transformed to the Penn Treebank style. All dependency trees are converted
from the transformed constituent trees using heuristics and labeling rules de-
signed specifically for the KAIST Treebank. In addition to the gold-standard
morphological analysis provided by the KAIST Treebank, two sets of automatic
morphological analysis are provided for the shared task, one is generated by
the HanNanum morphological analyzer, and the other is generated by the Sejong
morphological analyzer.
