The Zero Resource Speech Challenge 2017
We describe a new challenge aimed at discovering subword and word units from
raw speech. This challenge is the followup to the Zero Resource Speech
Challenge 2015. It aims at constructing systems that generalize across
languages and adapt to new speakers. The design features and evaluation metrics
of the challenge are presented and the results of seventeen models are
discussed.
