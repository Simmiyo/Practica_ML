Halo: Learning Semantics-Aware Representations for Cross-Lingual
  Information Extraction
Cross-lingual information extraction (CLIE) is an important and challenging
task, especially in low resource scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a training method, called Halo, which enforces the local region of each
hidden state of a neural model to only generate target tokens with the same
semantic structure tag. This simple but powerful technique enables a neural
model to learn semantics-aware representations that are robust to noise,
without introducing any extra parameter, thus yielding better generalization in
both high and low resource settings.
