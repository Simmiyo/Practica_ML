Experiment Segmentation in Scientific Discourse as Clause-level
  Structured Prediction using Recurrent Neural Networks
We propose a deep learning model for identifying structure within experiment
narratives in scientific literature. We take a sequence labeling approach to
this problem, and label clauses within experiment narratives to identify the
different parts of the experiment. Our dataset consists of paragraphs taken
from open access PubMed papers labeled with rhetorical information as a result
of our pilot annotation. Our model is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells that labels clauses. The clause
representations are computed by combining word representations using a novel
attention mechanism that involves a separate RNN. We compare this model against
LSTMs where the input layer has simple or no attention and a feature rich CRF
model. Furthermore, we describe how our work could be useful for information
extraction from scientific literature.
