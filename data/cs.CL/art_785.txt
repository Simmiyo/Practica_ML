Towards an Error Correction Memory to Enhance Technical Texts Authoring
  in LELIE
In this paper, we investigate and experiment the notion of error correction
memory applied to error correction in technical texts. The main purpose is to
induce relatively generic correction patterns associated with more contextual
correction recommendations, based on previously memorized and analyzed
corrections. The notion of error correction memory is developed within the
framework of the LELIE project and illustrated on the case of fuzzy lexical
items, which is a major problem in technical texts.
