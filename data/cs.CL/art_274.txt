A Public Reference Implementation of the RAP Anaphora Resolution
  Algorithm
This paper describes a standalone, publicly-available implementation of the
Resolution of Anaphora Procedure (RAP) given by Lappin and Leass (1994). The
RAP algorithm resolves third person pronouns, lexical anaphors, and identifies
pleonastic pronouns. Our implementation, JavaRAP, fills a current need in
anaphora resolution research by providing a reference implementation that can
be benchmarked against current algorithms. The implementation uses the
standard, publicly available Charniak (2000) parser as input, and generates a
list of anaphora-antecedent pairs as output. Alternately, an in-place
annotation or substitution of the anaphors with their antecedents can be
produced. Evaluation on the MUC-6 co-reference task shows that JavaRAP has an
accuracy of 57.9%, similar to the performance given previously in the
literature (e.g., Preiss 2002).
