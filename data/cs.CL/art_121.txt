Metonymy Interpretation Using X NO Y Examples
We developed on example-based method of metonymy interpretation. One
advantages of this method is that a hand-built database of metonymy is not
necessary because it instead uses examples in the form ``Noun X no Noun Y (Noun
Y of Noun X).'' Another advantage is that we will be able to interpret
newly-coined metonymic sentences by using a new corpus. We experimented with
metonymy interpretation and obtained a precision rate of 66% when using this
method.
