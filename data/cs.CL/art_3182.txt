A Simple Text Analytics Model To Assist Literary Criticism: comparative
  approach and example on James Joyce against Shakespeare and the Bible
Literary analysis, criticism or studies is a largely valued field with
dedicated journals and researchers which remains mostly within the humanities
scope. Text analytics is the computer-aided process of deriving information
from texts. In this article we describe a simple and generic model for
performing literary analysis using text analytics. The method relies on
statistical measures of: 1) token and sentence sizes and 2) Wordnet synset
features. These measures are then used in Principal Component Analysis where
the texts to be analyzed are observed against Shakespeare and the Bible,
regarded as reference literature. The model is validated by analyzing selected
works from James Joyce (1882-1941), one of the most important writers of the
20th century. We discuss the consistency of this approach, the reasons why we
did not use other techniques (e.g. part-of-speech tagging) and the ways by
which the analysis model might be adapted and enhanced.
