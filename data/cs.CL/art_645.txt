Analysing Quality of English-Hindi Machine Translation Engine Outputs
  Using Bayesian Classification
This paper considers the problem for estimating the quality of machine
translation outputs which are independent of human intervention and are
generally addressed using machine learning techniques.There are various
measures through which a machine learns translations quality. Automatic
Evaluation metrics produce good co-relation at corpus level but cannot produce
the same results at the same segment or sentence level. In this paper 16
features are extracted from the input sentences and their translations and a
quality score is obtained based on Bayesian inference produced from training
data.
