Exploring Metaphorical Senses and Word Representations for Identifying
  Metonyms
A metonym is a word with a figurative meaning, similar to a metaphor. Because
metonyms are closely related to metaphors, we apply features that are used
successfully for metaphor recognition to the task of detecting metonyms. On the
ACL SemEval 2007 Task 8 data with gold standard metonym annotations, our system
achieved 86.45% accuracy on the location metonyms. Our code can be found on
GitHub.
