CogALex-V Shared Task: LexNET - Integrated Path-based and Distributional
  Method for the Identification of Semantic Relations
We present a submission to the CogALex 2016 shared task on the corpus-based
identification of semantic relations, using LexNET (Shwartz and Dagan, 2016),
an integrated path-based and distributional method for semantic relation
classification. The reported results in the shared task bring this submission
to the third place on subtask 1 (word relatedness), and the first place on
subtask 2 (semantic relation classification), demonstrating the utility of
integrating the complementary path-based and distributional information sources
in recognizing concrete semantic relations. Combined with a common similarity
measure, LexNET performs fairly good on the word relatedness task (subtask 1).
The relatively low performance of LexNET and all other systems on subtask 2,
however, confirms the difficulty of the semantic relation classification task,
and stresses the need to develop additional methods for this task.
