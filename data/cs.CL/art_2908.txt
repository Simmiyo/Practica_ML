Measuring the Effect of Discourse Relations on Blog Summarization
The work presented in this paper attempts to evaluate and quantify the use of
discourse relations in the context of blog summarization and compare their use
to more traditional and factual texts. Specifically, we measured the usefulness
of 6 discourse relations - namely comparison, contingency, illustration,
attribution, topic-opinion, and attributive for the task of text summarization
from blogs. We have evaluated the effect of each relation using the TAC 2008
opinion summarization dataset and compared them with the results with the DUC
2007 dataset. The results show that in both textual genres, contingency,
comparison, and illustration relations provide a significant improvement on
summarization content; while attribution, topic-opinion, and attributive
relations do not provide a consistent and significant improvement. These
results indicate that, at least for summarization, discourse relations are just
as useful for informal and affective texts as for more traditional news
articles.
