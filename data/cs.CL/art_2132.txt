OC16-CE80: A Chinese-English Mixlingual Database and A Speech
  Recognition Baseline
We present the OC16-CE80 Chinese-English mixlingual speech database which was
released as a main resource for training, development and test for the
Chinese-English mixlingual speech recognition (MixASR-CHEN) challenge on
O-COCOSDA 2016. This database consists of 80 hours of speech signals recorded
from more than 1,400 speakers, where the utterances are in Chinese but each
involves one or several English words. Based on the database and another two
free data resources (THCHS30 and the CMU dictionary), a speech recognition
(ASR) baseline was constructed with the deep neural network-hidden Markov model
(DNN-HMM) hybrid system. We then report the baseline results following the
MixASR-CHEN evaluation rules and demonstrate that OC16-CE80 is a reasonable
data resource for mixlingual research.
