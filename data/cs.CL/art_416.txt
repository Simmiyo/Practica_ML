This document discusses an approach and its rudimentary realization towards
automatic classification of PPs; the topic, that has not received as much
attention in NLP as NPs and VPs. The approach is a rule-based heuristics
outlined in several levels of our research. There are 7 semantic categories of
PPs considered in this document that we are able to classify from an annotated
corpus.
