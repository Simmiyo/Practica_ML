A Character-Word Compositional Neural Language Model for Finnish
Inspired by recent research, we explore ways to model the highly
morphological Finnish language at the level of characters while maintaining the
performance of word-level models. We propose a new
Character-to-Word-to-Character (C2W2C) compositional language model that uses
characters as input and output while still internally processing word level
embeddings. Our preliminary experiments, using the Finnish Europarl V7 corpus,
indicate that C2W2C can respond well to the challenges of morphologically rich
languages such as high out of vocabulary rates, the prediction of novel words,
and growing vocabulary size. Notably, the model is able to correctly score
inflectional forms that are not present in the training data and sample
grammatically and semantically correct Finnish sentences character by
character.
