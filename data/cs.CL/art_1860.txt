Adversarial Deep Averaging Networks for Cross-Lingual Sentiment
  Classification
In recent years great success has been achieved in sentiment classification
for English, thanks in part to the availability of copious annotated resources.
Unfortunately, most languages do not enjoy such an abundance of labeled data.
To tackle the sentiment classification problem in low-resource languages
without adequate annotated data, we propose an Adversarial Deep Averaging
Network (ADAN) to transfer the knowledge learned from labeled data on a
resource-rich source language to low-resource languages where only unlabeled
data exists. ADAN has two discriminative branches: a sentiment classifier and
an adversarial language discriminator. Both branches take input from a shared
feature extractor to learn hidden representations that are simultaneously
indicative for the classification task and invariant across languages.
Experiments on Chinese and Arabic sentiment classification demonstrate that
ADAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems.
