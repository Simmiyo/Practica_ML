Syntagma Lexical Database
This paper discusses the structure of Syntagma's Lexical Database (focused on
Italian). The basic database consists in four tables. Table Forms contains word
inflections, used by the POS-tagger for the identification of input-words.
Forms is related to Lemma. Table Lemma stores all kinds of grammatical features
of words, word-level semantic data and restrictions. In the table Meanings
meaning-related data are stored: definition, examples, domain, and semantic
information. Table Valency contains the argument structure of each meaning,
with syntactic and semantic features for each argument. The extended version of
SLD contains the links to Syntagma's Semantic Net and to the WordNet synsets of
other languages.
