"How May I Help You?": Modeling Twitter Customer Service Conversations
  Using Fine-Grained Dialogue Acts
Given the increasing popularity of customer service dialogue on Twitter,
analysis of conversation data is essential to understand trends in customer and
agent behavior for the purpose of automating customer service interactions. In
this work, we develop a novel taxonomy of fine-grained "dialogue acts"
frequently observed in customer service, showcasing acts that are more suited
to the domain than the more generic existing taxonomies. Using a sequential
SVM-HMM model, we model conversation flow, predicting the dialogue act of a
given turn in real-time. We characterize differences between customer and agent
behavior in Twitter customer service conversations, and investigate the effect
of testing our system on different customer service industries. Finally, we use
a data-driven approach to predict important conversation outcomes: customer
satisfaction, customer frustration, and overall problem resolution. We show
that the type and location of certain dialogue acts in a conversation have a
significant effect on the probability of desirable and undesirable outcomes,
and present actionable rules based on our findings. The patterns and rules we
derive can be used as guidelines for outcome-driven automated customer service
platforms.
