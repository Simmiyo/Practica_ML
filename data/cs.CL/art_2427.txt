Simplifying the Bible and Wikipedia Using Statistical Machine
  Translation
I started this work with the hope of generating a text synthesizer (like a
musical synthesizer) that can imitate certain linguistic styles. Most of the
report focuses on text simplification using statistical machine translation
(SMT) techniques. I applied MOSES to a parallel corpus of the Bible (King James
Version and Easy-to-Read Version) and that of Wikipedia articles (normal and
simplified). I report the importance of the three main components of
SMT---phrase translation, language model, and recording---by changing their
weights and comparing the resulting quality of simplified text in terms of
METEOR and BLEU. Toward the end of the report will be presented some examples
of text "synthesized" into the King James style.
