Investigating the stylistic relevance of adjective and verb simile
  markers
Similes play an important role in literary texts not only as rhetorical
devices and as figures of speech but also because of their evocative power,
their aptness for description and the relative ease with which they can be
combined with other figures of speech (Israel et al. 2004). Detecting all types
of simile constructions in a particular text therefore seems crucial when
analysing the style of an author. Few research studies however have been
dedicated to the study of less prominent simile markers in fictional prose and
their relevance for stylistic studies. The present paper studies the frequency
of adjective and verb simile markers in a corpus of British and French novels
in order to determine which ones are really informative and worth including in
a stylistic analysis. Furthermore, are those adjectives and verb simile markers
used differently in both languages?
