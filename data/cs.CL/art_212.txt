A variable-free dynamic semantics
I propose a variable-free treatment of dynamic semantics. By "dynamic
semantics" I mean analyses of donkey sentences ("Every farmer who owns a donkey
beats it") and other binding and anaphora phenomena in natural language where
meanings of constituents are updates to information states, for instance as
proposed by Groenendijk and Stokhof. By "variable-free" I mean denotational
semantics in which functional combinators replace variable indices and
assignment functions, for instance as advocated by Jacobson.
  The new theory presented here achieves a compositional treatment of dynamic
anaphora that does not involve assignment functions, and separates the
combinatorics of variable-free semantics from the particular linguistic
phenomena it treats. Integrating variable-free semantics and dynamic semantics
gives rise to interactions that make new empirical predictions, for example
"donkey weak crossover" effects.
