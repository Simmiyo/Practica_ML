NRC-Canada at SMM4H Shared Task: Classifying Tweets Mentioning Adverse
  Drug Reactions and Medication Intake
Our team, NRC-Canada, participated in two shared tasks at the AMIA-2017
Workshop on Social Media Mining for Health Applications (SMM4H): Task 1 -
classification of tweets mentioning adverse drug reactions, and Task 2 -
classification of tweets describing personal medication intake. For both tasks,
we trained Support Vector Machine classifiers using a variety of surface-form,
sentiment, and domain-specific features. With nine teams participating in each
task, our submissions ranked first on Task 1 and third on Task 2. Handling
considerable class imbalance proved crucial for Task 1. We applied an
under-sampling technique to reduce class imbalance (from about 1:10 to 1:2).
Standard n-gram features, n-grams generalized over domain terms, as well as
general-domain and domain-specific word embeddings had a substantial impact on
the overall performance in both tasks. On the other hand, including sentiment
lexicon features did not result in any improvement.
