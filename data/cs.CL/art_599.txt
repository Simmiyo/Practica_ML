Automatic lexical semantic classification of nouns
The work we present here addresses cue-based noun classification in English
and Spanish. Its main objective is to automatically acquire lexical semantic
information by classifying nouns into previously known noun lexical classes.
This is achieved by using particular aspects of linguistic contexts as cues
that identify a specific lexical class. Here we concentrate on the task of
identifying such cues and the theoretical background that allows for an
assessment of the complexity of the task. The results show that, despite of the
a-priori complexity of the task, cue-based classification is a useful tool in
the automatic acquisition of lexical semantic classes.
