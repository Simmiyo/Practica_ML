Numeral Understanding in Financial Tweets for Fine-grained Crowd-based
  Forecasting
Numerals that contain much information in financial documents are crucial for
financial decision making. They play different roles in financial analysis
processes. This paper is aimed at understanding the meanings of numerals in
financial tweets for fine-grained crowd-based forecasting. We propose a
taxonomy that classifies the numerals in financial tweets into 7 categories,
and further extend some of these categories into several subcategories. Neural
network-based models with word and character-level encoders are proposed for
7-way classification and 17-way classification. We perform backtest to confirm
the effectiveness of the numeric opinions made by the crowd. This work is the
first attempt to understand numerals in financial social media data, and we
provide the first comparison of fine-grained opinion of individual investors
and analysts based on their forecast price. The numeral corpus used in our
experiments, called FinNum 1.0 , is available for research purposes.
