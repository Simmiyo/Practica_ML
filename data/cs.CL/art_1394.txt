Exploiting Unlabeled Data for Neural Grammatical Error Detection
Identifying and correcting grammatical errors in the text written by
non-native writers has received increasing attention in recent years. Although
a number of annotated corpora have been established to facilitate data-driven
grammatical error detection and correction approaches, they are still limited
in terms of quantity and coverage because human annotation is labor-intensive,
time-consuming, and expensive. In this work, we propose to utilize unlabeled
data to train neural network based grammatical error detection models. The
basic idea is to cast error detection as a binary classification problem and
derive positive and negative training examples from unlabeled data. We
introduce an attention-based neural network to capture long-distance
dependencies that influence the word being detected. Experiments show that the
proposed approach significantly outperforms SVMs and convolutional networks
with fixed-size context window.
