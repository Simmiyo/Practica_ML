Mining and Exploiting Domain-Specific Corpora in the PANACEA Platform
The objective of the PANACEA ICT-2007.2.2 EU project is to build a platform
that automates the stages involved in the acquisition, production, updating and
maintenance of the large language resources required by, among others, MT
systems. The development of a Corpus Acquisition Component (CAC) for extracting
monolingual and bilingual data from the web is one of the most innovative
building blocks of PANACEA. The CAC, which is the first stage in the PANACEA
pipeline for building Language Resources, adopts an efficient and distributed
methodology to crawl for web documents with rich textual content in specific
languages and predefined domains. The CAC includes modules that can acquire
parallel data from sites with in-domain content available in more than one
language. In order to extrinsically evaluate the CAC methodology, we have
conducted several experiments that used crawled parallel corpora for the
identification and extraction of parallel sentences using sentence alignment.
The corpora were then successfully used for domain adaptation of Machine
Translation Systems.
