Extracting Temporal and Causal Relations between Events
Structured information resulting from temporal information processing is
crucial for a variety of natural language processing tasks, for instance to
generate timeline summarization of events from news documents, or to answer
temporal/causal-related questions about some events. In this thesis we present
a framework for an integrated temporal and causal relation extraction system.
We first develop a robust extraction component for each type of relations, i.e.
temporal order and causality. We then combine the two extraction components
into an integrated relation extraction system, CATENA---CAusal and Temporal
relation Extraction from NAtural language texts---, by utilizing the
presumption about event precedence in causality, that causing events must
happened BEFORE resulting events. Several resources and techniques to improve
our relation extraction systems are also discussed, including word embeddings
and training data expansion. Finally, we report our adaptation efforts of
temporal information processing for languages other than English, namely
Italian and Indonesian.
