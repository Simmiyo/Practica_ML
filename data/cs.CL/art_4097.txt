Design Challenges and Misconceptions in Neural Sequence Labeling
We investigate the design challenges of constructing effective and efficient
neural sequence labeling systems, by reproducing twelve neural sequence
labeling models, which include most of the state-of-the-art structures, and
conduct a systematic model comparison on three benchmarks (i.e. NER, Chunking,
and POS tagging). Misconceptions and inconsistent conclusions in existing
literature are examined and clarified under statistical experiments. In the
comparison and analysis process, we reach several practical conclusions which
can be useful to practitioners.
