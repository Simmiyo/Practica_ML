Beam Search Decoding using Manner of Articulation Detection Knowledge
  Derived from Connectionist Temporal Classification
Manner of articulation detection using deep neural networks require a priori
knowledge of the attribute discriminative features or the decent phoneme
alignments. However generating an appropriate phoneme alignment is complex and
its performance depends on the choice of optimal number of senones, Gaussians,
etc. In the first part of our work, we exploit the manner of articulation
detection using connectionist temporal classification (CTC) which doesn't need
any phoneme alignment. Later we modify the state-of-the-art character based
posteriors generated by CTC using the manner of articulation CTC detector. Beam
search decoding is performed on the modified posteriors and it's impact on open
source datasets such as AN4 and LibriSpeech is observed.
