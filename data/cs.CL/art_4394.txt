Syntree2Vec - An algorithm to augment syntactic hierarchy into word
  embeddings
Word embeddings aims to map sense of the words into a lower dimensional
vector space in order to reason over them. Training embeddings on domain
specific data helps express concepts more relevant to their use case but comes
at a cost of accuracy when data is less. Our effort is to minimise this by
infusing syntactic knowledge into the embeddings. We propose a graph based
embedding algorithm inspired from node2vec. Experimental results have shown
that our algorithm improves the syntactic strength and gives robust performance
on meagre data.
