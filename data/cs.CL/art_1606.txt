Acronym Disambiguation: A Domain Independent Approach
Acronyms are omnipresent. They usually express information that is repetitive
and well known. But acronyms can also be ambiguous because there can be
multiple expansions for the same acronym. In this paper, we propose a general
system for acronym disambiguation that can work on any acronym given some
context information. We present methods for retrieving all the possible
expansions of an acronym from Wikipedia and AcronymsFinder.com. We propose to
use these expansions to collect all possible contexts in which these acronyms
are used and then score them using a paragraph embedding technique called
Doc2Vec. This method collectively led to achieving an accuracy of 90.9% in
selecting the correct expansion for given acronym, on a dataset we scraped from
Wikipedia with 707 distinct acronyms and 14,876 disambiguations.
