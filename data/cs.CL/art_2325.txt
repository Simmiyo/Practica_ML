Automated Phrase Mining from Massive Text Corpora
As one of the fundamental tasks in text analysis, phrase mining aims at
extracting quality phrases from a text corpus. Phrase mining is important in
various tasks such as information extraction/retrieval, taxonomy construction,
and topic modeling. Most existing methods rely on complex, trained linguistic
analyzers, and thus likely have unsatisfactory performance on text corpora of
new domains and genres without extra but expensive adaption. Recently, a few
data-driven methods have been developed successfully for extraction of phrases
from massive domain-specific text. However, none of the state-of-the-art models
is fully automated because they require human experts for designing rules or
labeling phrases.
  Since one can easily obtain many quality phrases from public knowledge bases
to a scale that is much larger than that produced by human experts, in this
paper, we propose a novel framework for automated phrase mining, AutoPhrase,
which leverages this large amount of high-quality phrases in an effective way
and achieves better performance compared to limited human labeled phrases. In
addition, we develop a POS-guided phrasal segmentation model, which
incorporates the shallow syntactic information in part-of-speech (POS) tags to
further enhance the performance, when a POS tagger is available. Note that,
AutoPhrase can support any language as long as a general knowledge base (e.g.,
Wikipedia) in that language is available, while benefiting from, but not
requiring, a POS tagger. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the new
method has shown significant improvements in effectiveness on five real-world
datasets across different domains and languages.
