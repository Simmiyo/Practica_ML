Generating Conceptual Metaphors from Proposition Stores
Contemporary research on computational processing of linguistic metaphors is
divided into two main branches: metaphor recognition and metaphor
interpretation. We take a different line of research and present an automated
method for generating conceptual metaphors from linguistic data. Given the
generated conceptual metaphors, we find corresponding linguistic metaphors in
corpora. In this paper, we describe our approach and its evaluation using
English and Russian data.
