Transliteration in Any Language with Surrogate Languages
We introduce a method for transliteration generation that can produce
transliterations in every language. Where previous results are only as
multilingual as Wikipedia, we show how to use training data from Wikipedia as
surrogate training for any language. Thus, the problem becomes one of ranking
Wikipedia languages in order of suitability with respect to a target language.
We introduce several task-specific methods for ranking languages, and show that
our approach is comparable to the oracle ceiling, and even outperforms it in
some cases.
