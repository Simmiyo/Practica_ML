Features of word similarity
In this theoretical note we compare different types of computational models
of word similarity and association in their ability to predict a set of about
900 rating data. Using regression and predictive modeling tools (neural net,
decision tree) the performance of a total of 28 models using different
combinations of both surface and semantic word features is evaluated. The
results present evidence for the hypothesis that word similarity ratings are
based on more than only semantic relatedness. The limited cross-validated
performance of the models asks for the development of psychological process
models of the word similarity rating task.
