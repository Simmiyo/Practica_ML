Sentiment/Subjectivity Analysis Survey for Languages other than English
Subjective and sentiment analysis have gained considerable attention
recently. Most of the resources and systems built so far are done for English.
The need for designing systems for other languages is increasing. This paper
surveys different ways used for building systems for subjective and sentiment
analysis for languages other than English. There are three different types of
systems used for building these systems. The first (and the best) one is the
language specific systems. The second type of systems involves reusing or
transferring sentiment resources from English to the target language. The third
type of methods is based on using language independent methods. The paper
presents a separate section devoted to Arabic sentiment analysis.
