Cross-lingual Semantic Parsing
We introduce the task of cross-lingual semantic parsing: mapping content
provided in a source language into a meaning representation based on a target
language. We present: (1) a meaning representation designed to allow systems to
target varying levels of structural complexity (shallow to deep analysis), (2)
an evaluation metric to measure the similarity between system output and
reference meaning representations, (3) an end-to-end model with a novel copy
mechanism that supports intrasentential coreference, and (4) an evaluation
dataset where experiments show our model outperforms strong baselines by at
least 1.18 F1 score.
