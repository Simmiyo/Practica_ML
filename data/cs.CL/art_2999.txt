Human Associations Help to Detect Conventionalized Multiword Expressions
In this paper we show that if we want to obtain human evidence about
conventionalization of some phrases, we should ask native speakers about
associations they have to a given phrase and its component words. We have shown
that if component words of a phrase have each other as frequent associations,
then this phrase can be considered as conventionalized. Another type of
conventionalized phrases can be revealed using two factors: low entropy of
phrase associations and low intersection of component word and phrase
associations. The association experiments were performed for the Russian
language.
