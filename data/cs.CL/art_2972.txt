Optimizing for Measure of Performance in Max-Margin Parsing
Many statistical learning problems in the area of natural language processing
including sequence tagging, sequence segmentation and syntactic parsing has
been successfully approached by means of structured prediction methods. An
appealing property of the corresponding discriminative learning algorithms is
their ability to integrate the loss function of interest directly into the
optimization process, which potentially can increase the resulting performance
accuracy. Here, we demonstrate on the example of constituency parsing how to
optimize for F1-score in the max-margin framework of structural SVM. In
particular, the optimization is with respect to the original (not binarized)
trees.
