Deep Learning applied to NLP
Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) are typically associated with Computer
Vision. CNNs are responsible for major breakthroughs in Image Classification
and are the core of most Computer Vision systems today. More recently CNNs have
been applied to problems in Natural Language Processing and gotten some
interesting results. In this paper, we will try to explain the basics of CNNs,
its different variations and how they have been applied to NLP.
