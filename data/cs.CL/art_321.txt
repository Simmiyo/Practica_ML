On the role of autocorrelations in texts
The task of finding a criterion allowing to distinguish a text from an
arbitrary set of words is rather relevant in itself, for instance, in the
aspect of development of means for internet-content indexing or separating
signals and noise in communication channels. The Zipf law is currently
considered to be the most reliable criterion of this kind [3]. At any rate,
conventional stochastic word sets do not meet this law. The present paper deals
with one of possible criteria based on the determination of the degree of data
compression.
