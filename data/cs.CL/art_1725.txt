Implicit Distortion and Fertility Models for Attention-based
  Encoder-Decoder NMT Model
Neural machine translation has shown very promising results lately. Most NMT
models follow the encoder-decoder framework. To make encoder-decoder models
more flexible, attention mechanism was introduced to machine translation and
also other tasks like speech recognition and image captioning. We observe that
the quality of translation by attention-based encoder-decoder can be
significantly damaged when the alignment is incorrect. We attribute these
problems to the lack of distortion and fertility models. Aiming to resolve
these problems, we propose new variations of attention-based encoder-decoder
and compare them with other models on machine translation. Our proposed method
achieved an improvement of 2 BLEU points over the original attention-based
encoder-decoder.
