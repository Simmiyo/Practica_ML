Phonetic based SoundEx & ShapeEx algorithm for Sindhi Spell Checker
  System
This paper presents a novel combinational phonetic algorithm for Sindhi
Language, to be used in developing Sindhi Spell Checker which has yet not been
developed prior to this work. The compound textual forms and glyphs of Sindhi
language presents a substantial challenge for developing Sindhi spell checker
system and generating similar suggestion list for misspelled words. In order to
implement such a system, phonetic based Sindhi language rules and patterns must
be considered into account for increasing the accuracy and efficiency. The
proposed system is developed with a blend between Phonetic based SoundEx
algorithm and ShapeEx algorithm for pattern or glyph matching, generating
accurate and efficient suggestion list for incorrect or misspelled Sindhi
words. A table of phonetically similar sounding Sindhi characters for SoundEx
algorithm is also generated along with another table containing similar glyph
or shape based character groups for ShapeEx algorithm. Both these are first
ever attempt of any such type of categorization and representation for Sindhi
Language.
