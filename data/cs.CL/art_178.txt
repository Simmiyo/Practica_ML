Applying Natural Language Generation to Indicative Summarization
The task of creating indicative summaries that help a searcher decide whether
to read a particular document is a difficult task. This paper examines the
indicative summarization task from a generation perspective, by first analyzing
its required content via published guidelines and corpus analysis. We show how
these summaries can be factored into a set of document features, and how an
implemented content planner uses the topicality document feature to create
indicative multidocument query-based summaries.
