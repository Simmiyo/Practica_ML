A Corpus of Deep Argumentative Structures as an Explanation to
  Argumentative Relations
In this paper, we compose a new task for deep argumentative structure
analysis that goes beyond shallow discourse structure analysis. The idea is
that argumentative relations can reasonably be represented with a small set of
predefined patterns. For example, using value judgment and bipolar causality,
we can explain a support relation between two argumentative segments as
follows: Segment 1 states that something is good, and Segment 2 states that it
is good because it promotes something good when it happens. We are motivated by
the following questions: (i) how do we formulate the task?, (ii) can a
reasonable pattern set be created?, and (iii) do the patterns work? To examine
the task feasibility, we conduct a three-stage, detailed annotation study using
357 argumentative relations from the argumentative microtext corpus, a small,
but highly reliable corpus. We report the coverage of explanations captured by
our patterns on a test set composed of 270 relations. Our coverage result of
74.6% indicates that argumentative relations can reasonably be explained by our
small pattern set. Our agreement result of 85.9% shows that a reasonable
inter-annotator agreement can be achieved. To assist with future work in
computational argumentation, the annotated corpus is made publicly available.
