An Empirical Evaluation of doc2vec with Practical Insights into Document
  Embedding Generation
Recently, Le and Mikolov (2014) proposed doc2vec as an extension to word2vec
(Mikolov et al., 2013a) to learn document-level embeddings. Despite promising
results in the original paper, others have struggled to reproduce those
results. This paper presents a rigorous empirical evaluation of doc2vec over
two tasks. We compare doc2vec to two baselines and two state-of-the-art
document embedding methodologies. We found that doc2vec performs robustly when
using models trained on large external corpora, and can be further improved by
using pre-trained word embeddings. We also provide recommendations on
hyper-parameter settings for general purpose applications, and release source
code to induce document embeddings using our trained doc2vec models.
