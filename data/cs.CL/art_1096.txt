A Multilingual FrameNet-based Grammar and Lexicon for Controlled Natural
  Language
Berkeley FrameNet is a lexico-semantic resource for English based on the
theory of frame semantics. It has been exploited in a range of natural language
processing applications and has inspired the development of framenets for many
languages. We present a methodological approach to the extraction and
generation of a computational multilingual FrameNet-based grammar and lexicon.
The approach leverages FrameNet-annotated corpora to automatically extract a
set of cross-lingual semantico-syntactic valence patterns. Based on data from
Berkeley FrameNet and Swedish FrameNet, the proposed approach has been
implemented in Grammatical Framework (GF), a categorial grammar formalism
specialized for multilingual grammars. The implementation of the grammar and
lexicon is supported by the design of FrameNet, providing a frame semantic
abstraction layer, an interlingual semantic API (application programming
interface), over the interlingual syntactic API already provided by GF Resource
Grammar Library. The evaluation of the acquired grammar and lexicon shows the
feasibility of the approach. Additionally, we illustrate how the FrameNet-based
grammar and lexicon are exploited in two distinct multilingual controlled
natural language applications. The produced resources are available under an
open source license.
