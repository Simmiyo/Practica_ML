Towards Neural Machine Translation with Partially Aligned Corpora
While neural machine translation (NMT) has become the new paradigm, the
parameter optimization requires large-scale parallel data which is scarce in
many domains and language pairs. In this paper, we address a new translation
scenario in which there only exists monolingual corpora and phrase pairs. We
propose a new method towards translation with partially aligned sentence pairs
which are derived from the phrase pairs and monolingual corpora. To make full
use of the partially aligned corpora, we adapt the conventional NMT training
method in two aspects. On one hand, different generation strategies are
designed for aligned and unaligned target words. On the other hand, a different
objective function is designed to model the partially aligned parts. The
experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve a relatively good result in
such a translation scenario, and tiny bitexts can boost translation quality to
a large extent.
