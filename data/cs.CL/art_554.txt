Appropriate Nouns with Obligatory Modifiers
The notion of appropriate sequence as introduced by Z. Harris provides a
powerful syntactic way of analysing the detailed meaning of various sentences,
including ambiguous ones. In an adjectival sentence like 'The leather was
yellow', the introduction of an appropriate noun, here 'colour', specifies
which quality the adjective describes. In some other adjectival sentences with
an appropriate noun, that noun plays the same part as 'colour' and seems to be
relevant to the description of the adjective. These appropriate nouns can
usually be used in elementary sentences like 'The leather had some colour', but
in many cases they have a more or less obligatory modifier. For example, you
can hardly mention that an object has a colour without qualifying that colour
at all. About 300 French nouns are appropriate in at least one adjectival
sentence and have an obligatory modifier. They enter in a number of sentence
structures related by several syntactic transformations. The appropriateness of
the noun and the fact that the modifier is obligatory are reflected in these
transformations. The description of these syntactic phenomena provides a basis
for a classification of these nouns. It also concerns the lexical properties of
thousands of predicative adjectives, and in particular the relations between
the sentence without the noun : 'The leather was yellow' and the adjectival
sentence with the noun : 'The colour of the leather was yellow'.
