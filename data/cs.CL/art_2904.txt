CLaC @ QATS: Quality Assessment for Text Simplification
This paper describes our approach to the 2016 QATS quality assessment shared
task. We trained three independent Random Forest classifiers in order to assess
the quality of the simplified texts in terms of grammaticality, meaning
preservation and simplicity. We used the language model of Google-Ngram as
feature to predict the grammaticality. Meaning preservation is predicted using
two complementary approaches based on word embedding and WordNet synonyms. A
wider range of features including TF-IDF, sentence length and frequency of cue
phrases are used to evaluate the simplicity aspect. Overall, the accuracy of
the system ranges from 33.33% for the overall aspect to 58.73% for
grammaticality.
