Event Representation through Semantic Roles: Evaluation of Coverage
Semantic role theory is a widely used approach for event representation. Yet,
there are multiple indications that semantic role paradigm is necessary but not
sufficient to cover all elements of event structure. We conducted an analysis
of semantic role representation for events to provide an empirical evidence of
insufficiency. The consequence of that is a hybrid role-scalar approach. The
results are considered as preliminary in investigation of semantic roles
coverage for event representation.
