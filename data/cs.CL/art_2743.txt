Detecting Intentional Lexical Ambiguity in English Puns
The article describes a model of automatic analysis of puns, where a word is
intentionally used in two meanings at the same time (the target word). We
employ Roget's Thesaurus to discover two groups of words which, in a pun, form
around two abstract bits of meaning (semes). They become a semantic vector,
based on which an SVM classifier learns to recognize puns, reaching a score
0.73 for F-measure. We apply several rule-based methods to locate intentionally
ambiguous (target) words, based on structural and semantic criteria. It appears
that the structural criterion is more effective, although it possibly
characterizes only the tested dataset. The results we get correlate with the
results of other teams at SemEval-2017 competition (Task 7 Detection and
Interpretation of English Puns) considering effects of using supervised
learning models and word statistics.
