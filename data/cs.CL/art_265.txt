Application Architecture for Spoken Language Resources in Organisational
  Settings
Special technologies need to be used to take advantage of, and overcome, the
challenges associated with acquiring, transforming, storing, processing, and
distributing spoken language resources in organisations. This paper introduces
an application architecture consisting of tools and supporting utilities for
indexing and transcription, and describes how these tools, together with
downstream processing and distribution systems, can be integrated into a
workflow. Two sample applications for this architecture are outlined- the
analysis of decision-making processes in organisations and the deployment of
systems development methods by designers in the field.
