IIIDYT at SemEval-2018 Task 3: Irony detection in English tweets
In this paper we introduce our system for the task of Irony detection in
English tweets, a part of SemEval 2018. We propose representation learning
approach that relies on a multi-layered bidirectional LSTM, without using
external features that provide additional semantic information. Although our
model is able to outperform the baseline in the validation set, our results
show limited generalization power over the test set. Given the limited size of
the dataset, we think the usage of more pre-training schemes would greatly
improve the obtained results.
