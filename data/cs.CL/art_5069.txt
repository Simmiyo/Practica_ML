Product Title Refinement via Multi-Modal Generative Adversarial Learning
Nowadays, an increasing number of customers are in favor of using E-commerce
Apps to browse and purchase products. Since merchants are usually inclined to
employ redundant and over-informative product titles to attract customers'
attention, it is of great importance to concisely display short product titles
on limited screen of cell phones. Previous researchers mainly consider textual
information of long product titles and lack of human-like view during training
and evaluation procedure. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Modal Generative
Adversarial Network (MM-GAN) for short product title generation, which
innovatively incorporates image information, attribute tags from the product
and the textual information from original long titles. MM-GAN treats short
titles generation as a reinforcement learning process, where the generated
titles are evaluated by the discriminator in a human-like view.
