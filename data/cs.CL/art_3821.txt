The Evolution of Popularity and Images of Characters in Marvel Cinematic
  Universe Fanfictions
This analysis proposes a new topic model to study the yearly trends in Marvel
Cinematic Universe fanfictions on three levels: character popularity, character
images/topics, and vocabulary pattern of topics. It is found that character
appearances in fanfictions have become more diverse over the years thanks to
constant introduction of new characters in feature films, and in the case of
Captain America, multi-dimensional character development is well-received by
the fanfiction world.
