Investigating Linguistic Pattern Ordering in Hierarchical Natural
  Language Generation
Natural language generation (NLG) is a critical component in spoken dialogue
system, which can be divided into two phases: (1) sentence planning: deciding
the overall sentence structure, (2) surface realization: determining specific
word forms and flattening the sentence structure into a string. With the rise
of deep learning, most modern NLG models are based on a sequence-to-sequence
(seq2seq) model, which basically contains an encoder-decoder structure; these
NLG models generate sentences from scratch by jointly optimizing sentence
planning and surface realization. However, such simple encoder-decoder
architecture usually fail to generate complex and long sentences, because the
decoder has difficulty learning all grammar and diction knowledge well. This
paper introduces an NLG model with a hierarchical attentional decoder, where
the hierarchy focuses on leveraging linguistic knowledge in a specific order.
The experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the
traditional seq2seq model with a smaller model size, and the design of the
hierarchical attentional decoder can be applied to various NLG systems.
Furthermore, different generation strategies based on linguistic patterns are
investigated and analyzed in order to guide future NLG research work.
