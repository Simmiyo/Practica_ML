Towards a General-Purpose Linguistic Annotation Backend
Language documentation is inherently a time-intensive process; transcription,
glossing, and corpus management consume a significant portion of documentary
linguists' work. Advances in natural language processing can help to accelerate
this work, using the linguists' past decisions as training material, but
questions remain about how to prioritize human involvement. In this extended
abstract, we describe the beginnings of a new project that will attempt to ease
this language documentation process through the use of natural language
processing (NLP) technology. It is based on (1) methods to adapt NLP tools to
new languages, based on recent advances in massively multilingual neural
networks, and (2) backend APIs and interfaces that allow linguists to upload
their data. We then describe our current progress on two fronts: automatic
phoneme transcription, and glossing. Finally, we briefly describe our future
directions.
