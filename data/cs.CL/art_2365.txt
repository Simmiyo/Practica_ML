Critical Survey of the Freely Available Arabic Corpora
The availability of corpora is a major factor in building natural language
processing applications. However, the costs of acquiring corpora can prevent
some researchers from going further in their endeavours. The ease of access to
freely available corpora is urgent needed in the NLP research community
especially for language such as Arabic. Currently, there is not easy was to
access to a comprehensive and updated list of freely available Arabic corpora.
We present in this paper, the results of a recent survey conducted to identify
the list of the freely available Arabic corpora and language resources. Our
preliminary results showed an initial list of 66 sources. We presents our
findings in the various categories studied and we provided the direct links to
get the data when possible.
