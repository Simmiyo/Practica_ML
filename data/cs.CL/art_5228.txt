Machine Translation: A Literature Review
Machine translation (MT) plays an important role in benefiting linguists,
sociologists, computer scientists, etc. by processing natural language to
translate it into some other natural language. And this demand has grown
exponentially over past couple of years, considering the enormous exchange of
information between different regions with different regional languages.
Machine Translation poses numerous challenges, some of which are: a) Not all
words in one language has equivalent word in another language b) Two given
languages may have completely different structures c) Words can have more than
one meaning. Owing to these challenges, along with many others, MT has been
active area of research for more than five decades. Numerous methods have been
proposed in the past which either aim at improving the quality of the
translations generated by them, or study the robustness of these systems by
measuring their performance on many different languages. In this literature
review, we discuss statistical approaches (in particular word-based and
phrase-based) and neural approaches which have gained widespread prominence
owing to their state-of-the-art results across multiple major languages.
