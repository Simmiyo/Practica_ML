Domain Aware Neural Dialog System
We investigate the task of building a domain aware chat system which
generates intelligent responses in a conversation comprising of different
domains. The domain, in this case, is the topic or theme of the conversation.
To achieve this, we present DOM-Seq2Seq, a domain aware neural network model
based on the novel technique of using domain-targeted sequence-to-sequence
models (Sutskever et al., 2014) and a domain classifier. The model captures
features from current utterance and domains of the previous utterances to
facilitate the formation of relevant responses. We evaluate our model on
automatic metrics and compare our performance with the Seq2Seq model.
