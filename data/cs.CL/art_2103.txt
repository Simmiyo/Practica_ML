Generating Politically-Relevant Event Data
Automatically generated political event data is an important part of the
social science data ecosystem. The approaches for generating this data, though,
have remained largely the same for two decades. During this time, the field of
computational linguistics has progressed tremendously. This paper presents an
overview of political event data, including methods and ontologies, and a set
of experiments to determine the applicability of deep neural networks to the
extraction of political events from news text.
