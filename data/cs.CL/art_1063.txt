Controlled Experiments for Word Embeddings
An experimental approach to studying the properties of word embeddings is
proposed. Controlled experiments, achieved through modifications of the
training corpus, permit the demonstration of direct relations between word
properties and word vector direction and length. The approach is demonstrated
using the word2vec CBOW model with experiments that independently vary word
frequency and word co-occurrence noise. The experiments reveal that word vector
length depends more or less linearly on both word frequency and the level of
noise in the co-occurrence distribution of the word. The coefficients of
linearity depend upon the word. The special point in feature space, defined by
the (artificial) word with pure noise in its co-occurrence distribution, is
found to be small but non-zero.
