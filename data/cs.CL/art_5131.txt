Strategy of the Negative Sampling for Training Retrieval-Based Dialogue
  Systems
The article describes the new approach for quality improvement of automated
dialogue systems for customer support service. Analysis produced in the paper
demonstrates the dependency of the quality of the retrieval-based dialogue
system quality on the choice of negative responses. The proposed approach
implies choosing the negative samples according to the distribution of
responses in the train set. In this implementation the negative samples are
randomly chosen from the original response distribution and from the
"artificial" distribution of negative responses, such as uniform distribution
or the distribution obtained by transformation of the original one. The results
obtained for the implemented systems and reported in this paper confirm the
significant improvement of automated dialogue systems quality in case of using
the negative responses from transformed distribution.
