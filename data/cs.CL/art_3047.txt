Improving Language Modelling with Noise-contrastive estimation
Neural language models do not scale well when the vocabulary is large.
Noise-contrastive estimation (NCE) is a sampling-based method that allows for
fast learning with large vocabularies. Although NCE has shown promising
performance in neural machine translation, it was considered to be an
unsuccessful approach for language modelling. A sufficient investigation of the
hyperparameters in the NCE-based neural language models was also missing. In
this paper, we showed that NCE can be a successful approach in neural language
modelling when the hyperparameters of a neural network are tuned appropriately.
We introduced the 'search-then-converge' learning rate schedule for NCE and
designed a heuristic that specifies how to use this schedule. The impact of the
other important hyperparameters, such as the dropout rate and the weight
initialisation range, was also demonstrated. We showed that appropriate tuning
of NCE-based neural language models outperforms the state-of-the-art
single-model methods on a popular benchmark.
