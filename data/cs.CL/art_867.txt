Computational Model to Generate Case-Inflected Forms of Masculine Nouns
  for Word Search in Sanskrit E-Text
The problem of word search in Sanskrit is inseparable from complexities that
include those caused by euphonic conjunctions and case-inflections. The
case-inflectional forms of a noun normally number 24 owing to the fact that in
Sanskrit there are eight cases and three numbers-singular, dual and plural. The
traditional method of generating these inflectional forms is rather elaborate
owing to the fact that there are differences in the forms generated between
even very similar words and there are subtle nuances involved. Further, it
would be a cumbersome exercise to generate and search for 24 forms of a word
during a word search in a large text, using the currently available
case-inflectional form generators. This study presents a new approach to
generating case-inflectional forms that is simpler to compute. Further, an
optimized model that is sufficient for generating only those word forms that
are required in a word search and is more than 80% efficient compared to the
complete case-inflectional forms generator, is presented in this study for the
first time.
