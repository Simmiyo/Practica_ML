Linguistic Legal Concept Extraction in Portuguese
This work investigates legal concepts and their expression in Portuguese,
concentrating on the "Order of Attorneys of Brazil" Bar exam. Using a corpus
formed by a collection of multiple-choice questions, three norms related to the
Ethics part of the OAB exam, language resources (Princeton WordNet and
OpenWordNet-PT) and tools (AntConc and Freeling), we began to investigate the
concepts and words missing from our repertory of concepts and words in
Portuguese, the knowledge base OpenWordNet-PT. We add these concepts and words
to OpenWordNet-PT and hence obtain a representation of these texts that is
"contained" in the lexical knowledge base.
