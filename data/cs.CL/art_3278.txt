A Gap-Based Framework for Chinese Word Segmentation via Very Deep
  Convolutional Networks
Most previous approaches to Chinese word segmentation can be roughly
classified into character-based and word-based methods. The former regards this
task as a sequence-labeling problem, while the latter directly segments
character sequence into words. However, if we consider segmenting a given
sentence, the most intuitive idea is to predict whether to segment for each gap
between two consecutive characters, which in comparison makes previous
approaches seem too complex. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a gap-based
framework to implement this intuitive idea. Moreover, very deep convolutional
neural networks, namely, ResNets and DenseNets, are exploited in our
experiments. Results show that our approach outperforms the best
character-based and word-based methods on 5 benchmarks, without any further
post-processing module (e.g. Conditional Random Fields) nor beam search.
