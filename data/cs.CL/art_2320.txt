The Parallel Meaning Bank: Towards a Multilingual Corpus of Translations
  Annotated with Compositional Meaning Representations
The Parallel Meaning Bank is a corpus of translations annotated with shared,
formal meaning representations comprising over 11 million words divided over
four languages (English, German, Italian, and Dutch). Our approach is based on
cross-lingual projection: automatically produced (and manually corrected)
semantic annotations for English sentences are mapped onto their word-aligned
translations, assuming that the translations are meaning-preserving. The
semantic annotation consists of five main steps: (i) segmentation of the text
in sentences and lexical items; (ii) syntactic parsing with Combinatory
Categorial Grammar; (iii) universal semantic tagging; (iv) symbolization; and
(v) compositional semantic analysis based on Discourse Representation Theory.
These steps are performed using statistical models trained in a semi-supervised
manner. The employed annotation models are all language-neutral. Our first
results are promising.
