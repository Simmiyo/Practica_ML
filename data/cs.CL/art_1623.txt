Identifying Patterns of Associated-Conditions through Topic Models of
  Electronic Medical Records
Multiple adverse health conditions co-occurring in a patient are typically
associated with poor prognosis and increased office or hospital visits.
Developing methods to identify patterns of co-occurring conditions can assist
in diagnosis. Thus identifying patterns of associations among co-occurring
conditions is of growing interest. In this paper, we report preliminary results
from a data-driven study, in which we apply a machine learning method, namely,
topic modeling, to electronic medical records, aiming to identify patterns of
associated conditions. Specifically, we use the well established latent
dirichlet allocation, a method based on the idea that documents can be modeled
as a mixture of latent topics, where each topic is a distribution over words.
In our study, we adapt the LDA model to identify latent topics in patients'
EMRs. We evaluate the performance of our method both qualitatively, and show
that the obtained topics indeed align well with distinct medical phenomena
characterized by co-occurring conditions.
