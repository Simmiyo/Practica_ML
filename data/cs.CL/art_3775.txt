Exploring Emoji Usage and Prediction Through a Temporal Variation Lens
The frequent use of Emojis on social media platforms has created a new form
of multimodal social interaction. Developing methods for the study and
representation of emoji semantics helps to improve future multimodal
communication systems. In this paper, we explore the usage and semantics of
emojis over time. We compare emoji embeddings trained on a corpus of different
seasons and show that some emojis are used differently depending on the time of
the year. Moreover, we propose a method to take into account the time
information for emoji prediction systems, outperforming state-of-the-art
systems. We show that, using the time information, the accuracy of some emojis
can be significantly improved.
