Calculating Probabilities Simplifies Word Learning
Children can use the statistical regularities of their environment to learn
word meanings, a mechanism known as cross-situational learning. We take a
computational approach to investigate how the information present during each
observation in a cross-situational framework can affect the overall acquisition
of word meanings. We do so by formulating various in-the-moment learning
mechanisms that are sensitive to different statistics of the environment, such
as counts and conditional probabilities. Each mechanism introduces a unique
source of competition or mutual exclusivity bias to the model; the mechanism
that maximally uses the model's knowledge of word meanings performs the best.
Moreover, the gap between this mechanism and others is amplified in more
challenging learning scenarios, such as learning from few examples.
