Topic Identification for Speech without ASR
Modern topic identification (topic ID) systems for speech use automatic
speech recognition (ASR) to produce speech transcripts, and perform supervised
classification on such ASR outputs. However, under resource-limited conditions,
the manually transcribed speech required to develop standard ASR systems can be
severely limited or unavailable. In this paper, we investigate alternative
unsupervised solutions to obtaining tokenizations of speech in terms of a
vocabulary of automatically discovered word-like or phoneme-like units, without
depending on the supervised training of ASR systems. Moreover, using automatic
phoneme-like tokenizations, we demonstrate that a convolutional neural network
based framework for learning spoken document representations provides
competitive performance compared to a standard bag-of-words representation, as
evidenced by comprehensive topic ID evaluations on both single-label and
multi-label classification tasks.
