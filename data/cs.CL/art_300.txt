Foundations of Modern Language Resource Archives
A number of serious reasons will convince an increasing amount of researchers
to store their relevant material in centers which we will call "language
resource archives". They combine the duty of taking care of long-term
preservation as well as the task to give access to their material to different
user groups. Access here is meant in the sense that an active interaction with
the data will be made possible to support the integration of new data, new
versions or commentaries of all sort. Modern Language Resource Archives will
have to adhere to a number of basic principles to fulfill all requirements and
they will have to be involved in federations to create joint language resource
domains making it even more simple for the researchers to access the data. This
paper makes an attempt to formulate the essential pillars language resource
archives have to adhere to.
