Arc-Standard Spinal Parsing with Stack-LSTMs
We present a neural transition-based parser for spinal trees, a dependency
representation of constituent trees. The parser uses Stack-LSTMs that compose
constituent nodes with dependency-based derivations. In experiments, we show
that this model adapts to different styles of dependency relations, but this
choice has little effect for predicting constituent structure, suggesting that
LSTMs induce useful states by themselves.
