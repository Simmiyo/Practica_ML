Can Prosody Aid the Automatic Classification of Dialog Acts in
  Conversational Speech?
Identifying whether an utterance is a statement, question, greeting, and so
forth is integral to effective automatic understanding of natural dialog.
Little is known, however, about how such dialog acts (DAs) can be automatically
classified in truly natural conversation. This study asks whether current
approaches, which use mainly word information, could be improved by adding
prosodic information. The study is based on more than 1000 conversations from
the Switchboard corpus. DAs were hand-annotated, and prosodic features
(duration, pause, F0, energy, and speaking rate) were automatically extracted
for each DA. In training, decision trees based on these features were inferred;
trees were then applied to unseen test data to evaluate performance.
Performance was evaluated for prosody models alone, and after combining the
prosody models with word information -- either from true words or from the
output of an automatic speech recognizer. For an overall classification task,
as well as three subtasks, prosody made significant contributions to
classification. Feature-specific analyses further revealed that although
canonical features (such as F0 for questions) were important, less obvious
features could compensate if canonical features were removed. Finally, in each
task, integrating the prosodic model with a DA-specific statistical language
model improved performance over that of the language model alone, especially
for the case of recognized words. Results suggest that DAs are redundantly
marked in natural conversation, and that a variety of automatically extractable
prosodic features could aid dialog processing in speech applications.
