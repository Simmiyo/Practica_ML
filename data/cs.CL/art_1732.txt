Hierarchical Latent Word Clustering
This paper presents a new Bayesian non-parametric model by extending the
usage of Hierarchical Dirichlet Allocation to extract tree structured word
clusters from text data. The inference algorithm of the model collects words in
a cluster if they share similar distribution over documents. In our
experiments, we observed meaningful hierarchical structures on NIPS corpus and
radiology reports collected from public repositories.
