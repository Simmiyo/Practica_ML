Learning opacity in Stratal Maximum Entropy Grammar
Opaque phonological patterns are sometimes claimed to be difficult to learn;
specific hypotheses have been advanced about the relative difficulty of
particular kinds of opaque processes (Kiparsky 1971, 1973), and the kind of
data that will be helpful in learning an opaque pattern (Kiparsky 2000). In
this paper, we present a computationally implemented learning theory for one
grammatical theory of opacity: a Maximum Entropy version of Stratal OT
(Berm\'udez-Otero 1999, Kiparsky 2000), and test it on simplified versions of
opaque French tense-lax vowel alternations and the opaque interaction of
diphthong raising and flapping in Canadian English. We find that the difficulty
of opacity can be influenced by evidence for stratal affiliation: the Canadian
English case is easier if the learner encounters application of raising outside
the flapping context, or non-application of raising between words (i.e., <life>
with a raised vowel; <lie for> with a non-raised vowel).
