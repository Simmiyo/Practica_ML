Google distance between words
Cilibrasi and Vitanyi have demonstrated that it is possible to extract the
meaning of words from the world-wide web. To achieve this, they rely on the
number of webpages that are found through a Google search containing a given
word and they associate the page count to the probability that the word appears
on a webpage. Thus, conditional probabilities allow them to correlate one word
with another word's meaning. Furthermore, they have developed a similarity
distance function that gauges how closely related a pair of words is. We
present a specific counterexample to the triangle inequality for this
similarity distance function.
