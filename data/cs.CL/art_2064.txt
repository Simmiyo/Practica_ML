A Context-aware Natural Language Generator for Dialogue Systems
We present a novel natural language generation system for spoken dialogue
systems capable of entraining (adapting) to users' way of speaking, providing
contextually appropriate responses. The generator is based on recurrent neural
networks and the sequence-to-sequence approach. It is fully trainable from data
which include preceding context along with responses to be generated. We show
that the context-aware generator yields significant improvements over the
baseline in both automatic metrics and a human pairwise preference test.
