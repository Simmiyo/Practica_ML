Universal Word Segmentation: Implementation and Interpretation
Word segmentation is a low-level NLP task that is non-trivial for a
considerable number of languages. In this paper, we present a sequence tagging
framework and apply it to word segmentation for a wide range of languages with
different writing systems and typological characteristics. Additionally, we
investigate the correlations between various typological factors and word
segmentation accuracy. The experimental results indicate that segmentation
accuracy is positively related to word boundary markers and negatively to the
number of unique non-segmental terms. Based on the analysis, we design a small
set of language-specific settings and extensively evaluate the segmentation
system on the Universal Dependencies datasets. Our model obtains
state-of-the-art accuracies on all the UD languages. It performs substantially
better on languages that are non-trivial to segment, such as Chinese, Japanese,
Arabic and Hebrew, when compared to previous work.
