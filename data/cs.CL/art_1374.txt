The Life of Lazarillo de Tormes and of His Machine Learning Adversities
Summit work of the Spanish Golden Age and forefather of the so-called
picaresque novel, The Life of Lazarillo de Tormes and of His Fortunes and
Adversities still remains an anonymous text. Although distinguished scholars
have tried to attribute it to different authors based on a variety of criteria,
a consensus has yet to be reached. The list of candidates is long and not all
of them enjoy the same support within the scholarly community. Analyzing their
works from a data-driven perspective and applying machine learning techniques
for style and text fingerprinting, we shed light on the authorship of the
Lazarillo. As in a state-of-the-art survey, we discuss the methods used and how
they perform in our specific case. According to our methodology, the most
likely author seems to be Juan Arce de Ot\'alora, closely followed by Alfonso
de Vald\'es. The method states that not certain attribution can be made with
the given corpus.
