The Galactic Dependencies Treebanks: Getting More Data by Synthesizing
  New Languages
We release Galactic Dependencies 1.0---a large set of synthetic languages not
found on Earth, but annotated in Universal Dependencies format. This new
resource aims to provide training and development data for NLP methods that aim
to adapt to unfamiliar languages. Each synthetic treebank is produced from a
real treebank by stochastically permuting the dependents of nouns and/or verbs
to match the word order of other real languages. We discuss the usefulness,
realism, parsability, perplexity, and diversity of the synthetic languages. As
a simple demonstration of the use of Galactic Dependencies, we consider
single-source transfer, which attempts to parse a real target language using a
parser trained on a "nearby" source language. We find that including synthetic
source languages somewhat increases the diversity of the source pool, which
significantly improves results for most target languages.
