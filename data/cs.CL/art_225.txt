Speech-Driven Text Retrieval: Using Target IR Collections for
  Statistical Language Model Adaptation in Speech Recognition
Speech recognition has of late become a practical technology for real world
applications. Aiming at speech-driven text retrieval, which facilitates
retrieving information with spoken queries, we propose a method to integrate
speech recognition and retrieval methods. Since users speak contents related to
a target collection, we adapt statistical language models used for speech
recognition based on the target collection, so as to improve both the
recognition and retrieval accuracy. Experiments using existing test collections
combined with dictated queries showed the effectiveness of our method.
