Optimality Theory as a Framework for Lexical Acquisition
This paper re-investigates a lexical acquisition system initially developed
for French.We show that, interestingly, the architecture of the system
reproduces and implements the main components of Optimality Theory. However, we
formulate the hypothesis that some of its limitations are mainly due to a poor
representation of the constraints used. Finally, we show how a better
representation of the constraints used would yield better results.
