Prosodic entrainment in dialog acts
We examined prosodic entrainment in spoken dialogs separately for several
dialog acts in cooperative and competitive games. Entrainment was measured for
intonation features derived from a superpositional intonation stylization as
well as for rhythm features. The found differences can be related to the
cooperative or competitive nature of the game, as well as to dialog act
properties as its intrinsic authority, supportiveness and distributional
characteristics. In cooperative games dialog acts with a high authority given
by knowledge and with a high frequency showed the most entrainment. The results
are discussed amongst others with respect to the degree of active entrainment
control in cooperative behavior.
