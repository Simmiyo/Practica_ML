Honk: A PyTorch Reimplementation of Convolutional Neural Networks for
  Keyword Spotting
We describe Honk, an open-source PyTorch reimplementation of convolutional
neural networks for keyword spotting that are included as examples in
TensorFlow. These models are useful for recognizing "command triggers" in
speech-based interfaces (e.g., "Hey Siri"), which serve as explicit cues for
audio recordings of utterances that are sent to the cloud for full speech
recognition. Evaluation on Google's recently released Speech Commands Dataset
shows that our reimplementation is comparable in accuracy and provides a
starting point for future work on the keyword spotting task.
