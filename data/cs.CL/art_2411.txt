SyntaxNet Models for the CoNLL 2017 Shared Task
We describe a baseline dependency parsing system for the CoNLL2017 Shared
Task. This system, which we call "ParseySaurus," uses the DRAGNN framework
[Kong et al, 2017] to combine transition-based recurrent parsing and tagging
with character-based word representations. On the v1.3 Universal Dependencies
Treebanks, the new system outpeforms the publicly available, state-of-the-art
"Parsey's Cousins" models by 3.47% absolute Labeled Accuracy Score (LAS) across
52 treebanks.
