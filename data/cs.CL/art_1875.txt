A Joint Model for Word Embedding and Word Morphology
This paper presents a joint model for performing unsupervised morphological
analysis on words, and learning a character-level composition function from
morphemes to word embeddings. Our model splits individual words into segments,
and weights each segment according to its ability to predict context words. Our
morphological analysis is comparable to dedicated morphological analyzers at
the task of morpheme boundary recovery, and also performs better than
word-based embedding models at the task of syntactic analogy answering.
Finally, we show that incorporating morphology explicitly into character-level
models help them produce embeddings for unseen words which correlate better
with human judgments.
