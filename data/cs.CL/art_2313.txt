Universal Dependencies to Logical Forms with Negation Scope
Many language technology applications would benefit from the ability to
represent negation and its scope on top of widely-used linguistic resources. In
this paper, we investigate the possibility of obtaining a first-order logic
representation with negation scope marked using Universal Dependencies. To do
so, we enhance UDepLambda, a framework that converts dependency graphs to
logical forms. The resulting UDepLambda$\lnot$ is able to handle phenomena
related to scope by means of an higher-order type theory, relevant not only to
negation but also to universal quantification and other complex semantic
phenomena. The initial conversion we did for English is promising, in that one
can represent the scope of negation also in the presence of more complex
phenomena such as universal quantifiers.
