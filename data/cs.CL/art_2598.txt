Crowdsourcing Argumentation Structures in Chinese Hotel Reviews
Argumentation mining aims at automatically extracting the premises-claim
discourse structures in natural language texts. There is a great demand for
argumentation corpora for customer reviews. However, due to the controversial
nature of the argumentation annotation task, there exist very few large-scale
argumentation corpora for customer reviews. In this work, we novelly use the
crowdsourcing technique to collect argumentation annotations in Chinese hotel
reviews. As the first Chinese argumentation dataset, our corpus includes 4814
argument component annotations and 411 argument relation annotations, and its
annotations qualities are comparable to some widely used argumentation corpora
in other languages.
