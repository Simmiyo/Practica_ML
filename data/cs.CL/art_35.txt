Evaluation of the NLP Components of the OVIS2 Spoken Dialogue System
The NWO Priority Programme Language and Speech Technology is a 5-year
research programme aiming at the development of spoken language information
systems. In the Programme, two alternative natural language processing (NLP)
modules are developed in parallel: a grammar-based (conventional, rule-based)
module and a data-oriented (memory-based, stochastic, DOP) module. In order to
compare the NLP modules, a formal evaluation has been carried out three years
after the start of the Programme. This paper describes the evaluation procedure
and the evaluation results. The grammar-based component performs much better
than the data-oriented one in this comparison.
