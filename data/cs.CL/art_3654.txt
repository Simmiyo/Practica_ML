Alquist: The Alexa Prize Socialbot
This paper describes a new open domain dialogue system Alquist developed as
part of the Alexa Prize competition for the Amazon Echo line of products. The
Alquist dialogue system is designed to conduct a coherent and engaging
conversation on popular topics. We are presenting a hybrid system combining
several machine learning and rule based approaches. We discuss and describe the
Alquist pipeline, data acquisition, and processing, dialogue manager, NLG,
knowledge aggregation and hierarchy of sub-dialogs. We present some of the
experimental results.
