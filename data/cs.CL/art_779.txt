Controlled Natural Language Generation from a Multilingual
  FrameNet-based Grammar
This paper presents a currently bilingual but potentially multilingual
FrameNet-based grammar library implemented in Grammatical Framework. The
contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, it offers a methodological
approach to automatically generate the grammar based on semantico-syntactic
valence patterns extracted from FrameNet-annotated corpora. Second, it provides
a proof of concept for two use cases illustrating how the acquired multilingual
grammar can be exploited in different CNL applications in the domains of arts
and tourism.
