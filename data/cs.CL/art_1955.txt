Representation of texts as complex networks: a mesoscopic approach
Statistical techniques that analyze texts, referred to as text analytics,
have departed from the use of simple word count statistics towards a new
paradigm. Text mining now hinges on a more sophisticated set of methods,
including the representations in terms of complex networks. While
well-established word-adjacency (co-occurrence) methods successfully grasp
syntactical features of written texts, they are unable to represent important
aspects of textual data, such as its topical structure, i.e. the sequence of
subjects developing at a mesoscopic level along the text. Such aspects are
often overlooked by current methodologies. In order to grasp the mesoscopic
characteristics of semantical content in written texts, we devised a network
model which is able to analyze documents in a multi-scale fashion. In the
proposed model, a limited amount of adjacent paragraphs are represented as
nodes, which are connected whenever they share a minimum semantical content. To
illustrate the capabilities of our model, we present, as a case example, a
qualitative analysis of "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland". We show that the
mesoscopic structure of a document, modeled as a network, reveals many semantic
traits of texts. Such an approach paves the way to a myriad of semantic-based
applications. In addition, our approach is illustrated in a machine learning
context, in which texts are classified among real texts and randomized
instances.
