Semantic WordRank: Generating Finer Single-Document Summarizations
We present Semantic WordRank (SWR), an unsupervised method for generating an
extractive summary of a single document. Built on a weighted word graph with
semantic and co-occurrence edges, SWR scores sentences using an
article-structure-biased PageRank algorithm with a Softplus function
adjustment, and promotes topic diversity using spectral subtopic clustering
under the Word-Movers-Distance metric. We evaluate SWR on the DUC-02 and
SummBank datasets and show that SWR produces better summaries than the
state-of-the-art algorithms over DUC-02 under common ROUGE measures. We then
show that, under the same measures over SummBank, SWR outperforms each of the
three human annotators (aka. judges) and compares favorably with the combined
performance of all judges.
