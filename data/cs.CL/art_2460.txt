MRA - Proof of Concept of a Multilingual Report Annotator Web
  Application
MRA (Multilingual Report Annotator) is a web application that translates
Radiology text and annotates it with RadLex terms. Its goal is to explore the
solution of translating non-English Radiology reports as a way to solve the
problem of most of the Text Mining tools being developed for English. In this
brief paper we explain the language barrier problem and shortly describe the
application. MRA can be found at https://github.com/lasigeBioTM/MRA .
