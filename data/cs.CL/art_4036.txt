Topic Modelling of Empirical Text Corpora: Validity, Reliability, and
  Reproducibility in Comparison to Semantic Maps
Using the 6,638 case descriptions of societal impact submitted for evaluation
in the Research Excellence Framework (REF 2014), we replicate the topic model
(Latent Dirichlet Allocation or LDA) made in this context and compare the
results with factor-analytic results using a traditional word-document matrix
(Principal Component Analysis or PCA). Removing a small fraction of documents
from the sample, for example, has on average a much larger impact on LDA than
on PCA-based models to the extent that the largest distortion in the case of
PCA has less effect than the smallest distortion of LDA-based models. In terms
of semantic coherence, however, LDA models outperform PCA-based models. The
topic models inform us about the statistical properties of the document sets
under study, but the results are statistical and should not be used for a
semantic interpretation - for example, in grant selections and micro-decision
making, or scholarly work-without follow-up using domain-specific semantic
maps.
