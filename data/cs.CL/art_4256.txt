LSTMs with Attention for Aggression Detection
In this paper, we describe the system submitted for the shared task on
Aggression Identification in Facebook posts and comments by the team Nishnik.
Previous works demonstrate that LSTMs have achieved remarkable performance in
natural language processing tasks. We deploy an LSTM model with an attention
unit over it. Our system ranks 6th and 4th in the Hindi subtask for Facebook
comments and subtask for generalized social media data respectively. And it
ranks 17th and 10th in the corresponding English subtasks.
