Modelling Semantic Association and Conceptual Inheritance for Semantic
  Analysis
Allowing users to interact through language borders is an interesting
challenge for information technology. For the purpose of a computer assisted
language learning system, we have chosen icons for representing meaning on the
input interface, since icons do not depend on a particular language. However, a
key limitation of this type of communication is the expression of articulated
ideas instead of isolated concepts. We propose a method to interpret sequences
of icons as complex messages by reconstructing the relations between concepts,
so as to build conceptual graphs able to represent meaning and to be used for
natural language sentence generation. This method is based on an electronic
dictionary containing semantic information.
