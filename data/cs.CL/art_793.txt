Assamese-English Bilingual Machine Translation
Machine translation is the process of translating text from one language to
another. In this paper, Statistical Machine Translation is done on Assamese and
English language by taking their respective parallel corpus. A statistical
phrase based translation toolkit Moses is used here. To develop the language
model and to align the words we used two another tools IRSTLM, GIZA
respectively. BLEU score is used to check our translation system performance,
how good it is. A difference in BLEU scores is obtained while translating
sentences from Assamese to English and vice-versa. Since Indian languages are
morphologically very rich hence translation is relatively harder from English
to Assamese resulting in a low BLEU score. A statistical transliteration system
is also introduced with our translation system to deal basically with proper
nouns, OOV (out of vocabulary) words which are not present in our corpus.
