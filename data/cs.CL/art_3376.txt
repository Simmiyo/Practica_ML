DisMo: A Morphosyntactic, Disfluency and Multi-Word Unit Annotator. An
  Evaluation on a Corpus of French Spontaneous and Read Speech
We present DisMo, a multi-level annotator for spoken language corpora that
integrates part-of-speech tagging with basic disfluency detection and
annotation, and multi-word unit recognition. DisMo is a hybrid system that uses
a combination of lexical resources, rules, and statistical models based on
Conditional Random Fields (CRF). In this paper, we present the first public
version of DisMo for French. The system is trained and its performance
evaluated on a 57k-token corpus, including different varieties of French spoken
in three countries (Belgium, France and Switzerland). DisMo supports a
multi-level annotation scheme, in which the tokenisation to minimal word units
is complemented with multi-word unit groupings (each having associated POS
tags), as well as separate levels for annotating disfluencies and discourse
phenomena. We present the system's architecture, linguistic resources and its
hierarchical tag-set. Results show that DisMo achieves a precision of 95%
(finest tag-set) to 96.8% (coarse tag-set) in POS-tagging non-punctuated,
sound-aligned transcriptions of spoken French, while also offering substantial
possibilities for automated multi-level annotation.
