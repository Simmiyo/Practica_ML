A Compact Architecture for Dialogue Management Based on Scripts and
  Meta-Outputs
We describe an architecture for spoken dialogue interfaces to semi-autonomous
systems that transforms speech signals through successive representations of
linguistic, dialogue, and domain knowledge. Each step produces an output, and a
meta-output describing the transformation, with an executable program in a
simple scripting language as the final result. The output/meta-output
distinction permits perspicuous treatment of diverse tasks such as resolving
pronouns, correcting user misconceptions, and optimizing scripts.
