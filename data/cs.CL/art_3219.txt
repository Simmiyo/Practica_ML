Neural Machine Translation by Generating Multiple Linguistic Factors
Factored neural machine translation (FNMT) is founded on the idea of using
the morphological and grammatical decomposition of the words (factors) at the
output side of the neural network. This architecture addresses two well-known
problems occurring in MT, namely the size of target language vocabulary and the
number of unknown tokens produced in the translation. FNMT system is designed
to manage larger vocabulary and reduce the training time (for systems with
equivalent target language vocabulary size). Moreover, we can produce
grammatically correct words that are not part of the vocabulary. FNMT model is
evaluated on IWSLT'15 English to French task and compared to the baseline
word-based and BPE-based NMT systems. Promising qualitative and quantitative
results (in terms of BLEU and METEOR) are reported.
