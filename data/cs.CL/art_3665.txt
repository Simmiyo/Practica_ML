Helping or Hurting? Predicting Changes in Users' Risk of Self-Harm
  Through Online Community Interactions
In recent years, online communities have formed around suicide and self-harm
prevention. While these communities offer support in moment of crisis, they can
also normalize harmful behavior, discourage professional treatment, and
instigate suicidal ideation. In this work, we focus on how interaction with
others in such a community affects the mental state of users who are seeking
support. We first build a dataset of conversation threads between users in a
distressed state and community members offering support. We then show how to
construct a classifier to predict whether distressed users are helped or harmed
by the interactions in the thread, and we achieve a macro-F1 score of up to
0.69.
