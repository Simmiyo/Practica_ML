Handling Verb Phrase Anaphora with Dependent Types and Events
This paper studies how dependent typed events can be used to treat verb
phrase anaphora. We introduce a framework that extends Dependent Type Semantics
(DTS) with a new atomic type for neo-Davidsonian events and an extended
@-operator that can return new events that share properties of events
referenced by verb phrase anaphora. The proposed framework, along with
illustrative examples of its use, are presented after a brief overview of the
necessary background and of the major challenges posed by verb phrase anaphora.
