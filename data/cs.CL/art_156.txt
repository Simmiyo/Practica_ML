CRL at Ntcir2
We have developed systems of two types for NTCIR2. One is an enhenced version
of the system we developed for NTCIR1 and IREX. It submitted retrieval results
for JJ and CC tasks. A variety of parameters were tried with the system. It
used such characteristics of newspapers as locational information in the CC
tasks. The system got good results for both of the tasks. The other system is a
portable system which avoids free parameters as much as possible. The system
submitted retrieval results for JJ, JE, EE, EJ, and CC tasks. The system
automatically determined the number of top documents and the weight of the
original query used in automatic-feedback retrieval. It also determined
relevant terms quite robustly. For EJ and JE tasks, it used document expansion
to augment the initial queries. It achieved good results, except on the CC
tasks.
