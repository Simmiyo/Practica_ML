Acquiring Correct Knowledge for Natural Language Generation
Natural language generation (NLG) systems are computer software systems that
produce texts in English and other human languages, often from non-linguistic
input data. NLG systems, like most AI systems, need substantial amounts of
knowledge. However, our experience in two NLG projects suggests that it is
difficult to acquire correct knowledge for NLG systems; indeed, every knowledge
acquisition (KA) technique we tried had significant problems. In general terms,
these problems were due to the complexity, novelty, and poorly understood
nature of the tasks our systems attempted, and were worsened by the fact that
people write so differently. This meant in particular that corpus-based KA
approaches suffered because it was impossible to assemble a sizable corpus of
high-quality consistent manually written texts in our domains; and structured
expert-oriented KA techniques suffered because experts disagreed and because we
could not get enough information about special and unusual cases to build
robust systems. We believe that such problems are likely to affect many other
NLG systems as well. In the long term, we hope that new KA techniques may
emerge to help NLG system builders. In the shorter term, we believe that
understanding how individual KA techniques can fail, and using a mixture of
different KA techniques with different strengths and weaknesses, can help
developers acquire NLG knowledge that is mostly correct.
