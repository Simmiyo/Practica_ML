A Multi-task Ensemble Framework for Emotion, Sentiment and Intensity
  Prediction
In this paper, through multi-task ensemble framework we address three
problems of emotion and sentiment analysis i.e. "emotion classification &
intensity", "valence, arousal & dominance for emotion" and "valence & arousal}
for sentiment". The underlying problems cover two granularities (i.e.
coarse-grained and fine-grained) and a diverse range of domains (i.e. tweets,
Facebook posts, news headlines, blogs, letters etc.). The ensemble model aims
to leverage the learned representations of three deep learning models (i.e.
CNN, LSTM and GRU) and a hand-crafted feature representation for the
predictions. Experimental results on the benchmark datasets show the efficacy
of our proposed multi-task ensemble frameworks. We obtain the performance
improvement of 2-3 points on an average over single-task systems for most of
the problems and domains.
