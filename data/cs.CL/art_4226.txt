NMT-Keras: a Very Flexible Toolkit with a Focus on Interactive NMT and
  Online Learning
We present NMT-Keras, a flexible toolkit for training deep learning models,
which puts a particular emphasis on the development of advanced applications of
neural machine translation systems, such as interactive-predictive translation
protocols and long-term adaptation of the translation system via continuous
learning. NMT-Keras is based on an extended version of the popular Keras
library, and it runs on Theano and Tensorflow. State-of-the-art neural machine
translation models are deployed and used following the high-level framework
provided by Keras. Given its high modularity and flexibility, it also has been
extended to tackle different problems, such as image and video captioning,
sentence classification and visual question answering.
