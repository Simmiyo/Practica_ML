Improved Dynamic Memory Network for Dialogue Act Classification with
  Adversarial Training
Dialogue Act (DA) classification is a challenging problem in dialogue
interpretation, which aims to attach semantic labels to utterances and
characterize the speaker's intention. Currently, many existing approaches
formulate the DA classification problem ranging from multi-classification to
structured prediction, which suffer from two limitations: a) these methods are
either handcrafted feature-based or have limited memories. b) adversarial
examples can't be correctly classified by traditional training methods. To
address these issues, in this paper we first cast the problem into a question
and answering problem and proposed an improved dynamic memory networks with
hierarchical pyramidal utterance encoder. Moreover, we apply adversarial
training to train our proposed model. We evaluate our model on two public
datasets, i.e., Switchboard dialogue act corpus and the MapTask corpus.
Extensive experiments show that our proposed model is not only robust, but also
achieves better performance when compared with some state-of-the-art baselines.
