From Word Segmentation to POS Tagging for Vietnamese
This paper presents an empirical comparison of two strategies for Vietnamese
Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging from unsegmented text: (i) a pipeline strategy
where we consider the output of a word segmenter as the input of a POS tagger,
and (ii) a joint strategy where we predict a combined segmentation and POS tag
for each syllable. We also make a comparison between state-of-the-art (SOTA)
feature-based and neural network-based models. On the benchmark Vietnamese
treebank (Nguyen et al., 2009), experimental results show that the pipeline
strategy produces better scores of POS tagging from unsegmented text than the
joint strategy, and the highest accuracy is obtained by using a feature-based
model.
