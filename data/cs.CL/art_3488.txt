MCScript: A Novel Dataset for Assessing Machine Comprehension Using
  Script Knowledge
We introduce a large dataset of narrative texts and questions about these
texts, intended to be used in a machine comprehension task that requires
reasoning using commonsense knowledge. Our dataset complements similar datasets
in that we focus on stories about everyday activities, such as going to the
movies or working in the garden, and that the questions require commonsense
knowledge, or more specifically, script knowledge, to be answered. We show that
our mode of data collection via crowdsourcing results in a substantial amount
of such inference questions. The dataset forms the basis of a shared task on
commonsense and script knowledge organized at SemEval 2018 and provides
challenging test cases for the broader natural language understanding
community.
