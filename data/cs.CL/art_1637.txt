Les Entités Nommées : usage et degrés de précision et de
  désambiguïsation
The recognition and classification of Named Entities (NER) are regarded as an
important component for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications.
The classification is usually made by taking into account the immediate context
in which the NE appears. In some cases, this immediate context does not allow
getting the right classification. We show in this paper that the use of an
extended syntactic context and large-scale resources could be very useful in
the NER task.
