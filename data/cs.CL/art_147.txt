Do All Fragments Count?
We aim at finding the minimal set of fragments which achieves maximal parse
accuracy in Data Oriented Parsing. Experiments with the Penn Wall Street
Journal treebank show that counts of almost arbitrary fragments within parse
trees are important, leading to improved parse accuracy over previous models
tested on this treebank. We isolate a number of dependency relations which
previous models neglect but which contribute to higher parse accuracy.
