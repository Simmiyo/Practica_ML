NLITrans at SemEval-2018 Task 12: Transfer of Semantic Knowledge for
  Argument Comprehension
The Argument Reasoning Comprehension Task requires significant language
understanding and complex reasoning over world knowledge. We focus on transfer
of a sentence encoder to bootstrap more complicated models given the small size
of the dataset. Our best model uses a pre-trained BiLSTM to encode input
sentences, learns task-specific features for the argument and warrants, then
performs independent argument-warrant matching. This model achieves mean test
set accuracy of 64.43%. Encoder transfer yields a significant gain to our best
model over random initialization. Independent warrant matching effectively
doubles the size of the dataset and provides additional regularization. We
demonstrate that regularization comes from ignoring statistical correlations
between warrant features and position. We also report an experiment with our
best model that only matches warrants to reasons, ignoring claims. Relatively
low performance degradation suggests that our model is not necessarily learning
the intended task.
