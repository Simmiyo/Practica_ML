Statistical Sign Language Machine Translation: from English written text
  to American Sign Language Gloss
This works aims to design a statistical machine translation from English text
to American Sign Language (ASL). The system is based on Moses tool with some
modifications and the results are synthesized through a 3D avatar for
interpretation. First, we translate the input text to gloss, a written form of
ASL. Second, we pass the output to the WebSign Plug-in to play the sign.
Contributions of this work are the use of a new couple of language English/ASL
and an improvement of statistical machine translation based on string matching
thanks to Jaro-distance.
