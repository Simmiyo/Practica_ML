Dataset for the First Evaluation on Chinese Machine Reading
  Comprehension
Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) has become enormously popular recently
and has attracted a lot of attention. However, existing reading comprehension
datasets are mostly in English. To add diversity in reading comprehension
datasets, in this paper we propose a new Chinese reading comprehension dataset
for accelerating related research in the community. The proposed dataset
contains two different types: cloze-style reading comprehension and user query
reading comprehension, associated with large-scale training data as well as
human-annotated validation and hidden test set. Along with this dataset, we
also hosted the first Evaluation on Chinese Machine Reading Comprehension
(CMRC-2017) and successfully attracted tens of participants, which suggest the
potential impact of this dataset.
