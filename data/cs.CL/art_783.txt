Translation Of Telugu-Marathi and Vice-Versa using Rule Based Machine
  Translation
In todays digital world automated Machine Translation of one language to
another has covered a long way to achieve different kinds of success stories.
Whereas Babel Fish supports a good number of foreign languages and only Hindi
from Indian languages, the Google Translator takes care of about 10 Indian
languages. Though most of the Automated Machine Translation Systems are doing
well but handling Indian languages needs a major care while handling the local
proverbs/ idioms. Most of the Machine Translation system follows the direct
translation approach while translating one Indian language to other. Our
research at KMIT R&D Lab found that handling the local proverbs/idioms is not
given enough attention by the earlier research work. This paper focuses on two
of the majorly spoken Indian languages Marathi and Telugu, and translation
between them. Handling proverbs and idioms of both the languages have been
given a special care, and the research outcome shows a significant achievement
in this direction.
