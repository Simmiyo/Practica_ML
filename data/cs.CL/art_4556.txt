Comparative Studies of Detecting Abusive Language on Twitter
The context-dependent nature of online aggression makes annotating large
collections of data extremely difficult. Previously studied datasets in abusive
language detection have been insufficient in size to efficiently train deep
learning models. Recently, Hate and Abusive Speech on Twitter, a dataset much
greater in size and reliability, has been released. However, this dataset has
not been comprehensively studied to its potential. In this paper, we conduct
the first comparative study of various learning models on Hate and Abusive
Speech on Twitter, and discuss the possibility of using additional features and
context data for improvements. Experimental results show that bidirectional GRU
networks trained on word-level features, with Latent Topic Clustering modules,
is the most accurate model scoring 0.805 F1.
