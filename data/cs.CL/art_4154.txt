TxPI-u: A Resource for Personality Identification of Undergraduates
Resources such as labeled corpora are necessary to train automatic models
within the natural language processing (NLP) field. Historically, a large
number of resources regarding a broad number of problems are available mostly
in English. One of such problems is known as Personality Identification where
based on a psychological model (e.g. The Big Five Model), the goal is to find
the traits of a subject's personality given, for instance, a text written by
the same subject. In this paper we introduce a new corpus in Spanish called
Texts for Personality Identification (TxPI). This corpus will help to develop
models to automatically assign a personality trait to an author of a text
document. Our corpus, TxPI-u, contains information of 416 Mexican undergraduate
students with some demographics information such as, age, gender, and the
academic program they are enrolled. Finally, as an additional contribution, we
present a set of baselines to provide a comparison scheme for further research.
