Passing the Brazilian OAB Exam: data preparation and some experiments
In Brazil, all legal professionals must demonstrate their knowledge of the
law and its application by passing the OAB exams, the national bar exams. The
OAB exams therefore provide an excellent benchmark for the performance of legal
information systems since passing the exam would arguably signal that the
system has acquired capacity of legal reasoning comparable to that of a human
lawyer. This article describes the construction of a new data set and some
preliminary experiments on it, treating the problem of finding the
justification for the answers to questions. The results provide a baseline
performance measure against which to evaluate future improvements. We discuss
the reasons to the poor performance and propose next steps.
