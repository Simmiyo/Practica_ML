Architectural Considerations for Conversational Systems -- The
  Verbmobil/INTARC Experience
The paper describes the speech to speech translation system INTARC, developed
during the first phase of the Verbmobil project. The general design goals of
the INTARC system architecture were time synchronous processing as well as
incrementality and interactivity as a means to achieve a higher degree of
robustness and scalability. Interactivity means that in addition to the
bottom-up (in terms of processing levels) data flow the ability to process
top-down restrictions considering the same signal segment for all processing
levels. The construction of INTARC 2.0, which has been operational since fall
1996, followed an engineering approach focussing on the integration of symbolic
(linguistic) and stochastic (recognition) techniques which led to a
generalization of the concept of a ``one pass'' beam search.
