An Effective Approach to Biomedical Information Extraction with Limited
  Training Data
Overall, the two main contributions of this work include the application of
sentence simplification to association extraction as described above, and the
use of distributional semantics for concept extraction. The proposed work on
concept extraction amalgamates for the first time two diverse research areas
-distributional semantics and information extraction. This approach renders all
the advantages offered in other semi-supervised machine learning systems, and,
unlike other proposed semi-supervised approaches, it can be used on top of
different basic frameworks and algorithms.
