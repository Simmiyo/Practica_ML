Detecting English Writing Styles For Non-native Speakers
Analyzing writing styles of non-native speakers is a challenging task. In
this paper, we analyze the comments written in the discussion pages of the
English Wikipedia. Using learning algorithms, we are able to detect native
speakers' writing style with an accuracy of 74%. Given the diversity of the
English Wikipedia users and the large number of languages they speak, we
measure the similarities among their native languages by comparing the
influence they have on their English writing style. Our results show that
languages known to have the same origin and development path have similar
footprint on their speakers' English writing style. To enable further studies,
the dataset we extracted from Wikipedia will be made available publicly.
