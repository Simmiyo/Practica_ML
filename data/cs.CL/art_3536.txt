Aggression-annotated Corpus of Hindi-English Code-mixed Data
As the interaction over the web has increased, incidents of aggression and
related events like trolling, cyberbullying, flaming, hate speech, etc. too
have increased manifold across the globe. While most of these behaviour like
bullying or hate speech have predated the Internet, the reach and extent of the
Internet has given these an unprecedented power and influence to affect the
lives of billions of people. So it is of utmost significance and importance
that some preventive measures be taken to provide safeguard to the people using
the web such that the web remains a viable medium of communication and
connection, in general. In this paper, we discuss the development of an
aggression tagset and an annotated corpus of Hindi-English code-mixed data from
two of the most popular social networking and social media platforms in India,
Twitter and Facebook. The corpus is annotated using a hierarchical tagset of 3
top-level tags and 10 level 2 tags. The final dataset contains approximately
18k tweets and 21k facebook comments and is being released for further research
in the field.
