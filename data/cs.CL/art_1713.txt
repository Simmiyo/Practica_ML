Part-of-Speech Tagging for Code-mixed Indian Social Media Text at ICON
  2015
This paper discusses the experiments carried out by us at Jadavpur University
as part of the participation in ICON 2015 task: POS Tagging for Code-mixed
Indian Social Media Text. The tool that we have developed for the task is based
on Trigram Hidden Markov Model that utilizes information from dictionary as
well as some other word level features to enhance the observation probabilities
of the known tokens as well as unknown tokens. We submitted runs for
Bengali-English, Hindi-English and Tamil-English Language pairs. Our system has
been trained and tested on the datasets released for ICON 2015 shared task: POS
Tagging For Code-mixed Indian Social Media Text. In constrained mode, our
system obtains average overall accuracy (averaged over all three language
pairs) of 75.60% which is very close to other participating two systems (76.79%
for IIITH and 75.79% for AMRITA_CEN) ranked higher than our system. In
unconstrained mode, our system obtains average overall accuracy of 70.65% which
is also close to the system (72.85% for AMRITA_CEN) which obtains the highest
average overall accuracy.
