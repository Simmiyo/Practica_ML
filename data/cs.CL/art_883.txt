Annotating Cognates and Etymological Origin in Turkic Languages
Turkic languages exhibit extensive and diverse etymological relationships
among lexical items. These relationships make the Turkic languages promising
for exploring automated translation lexicon induction by leveraging cognate and
other etymological information. However, due to the extent and diversity of the
types of relationships between words, it is not clear how to annotate such
information. In this paper, we present a methodology for annotating cognates
and etymological origin in Turkic languages. Our method strives to balance the
amount of research effort the annotator expends with the utility of the
annotations for supporting research on improving automated translation lexicon
induction.
