Phonology
Phonology is the systematic study of the sounds used in language, their
internal structure, and their composition into syllables, words and phrases.
Computational phonology is the application of formal and computational
techniques to the representation and processing of phonological information.
This chapter will present the fundamentals of descriptive phonology along with
a brief overview of computational phonology.
