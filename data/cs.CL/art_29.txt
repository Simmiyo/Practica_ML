Transducers from Rewrite Rules with Backreferences
Context sensitive rewrite rules have been widely used in several areas of
natural language processing, including syntax, morphology, phonology and speech
processing. Kaplan and Kay, Karttunen, and Mohri & Sproat have given various
algorithms to compile such rewrite rules into finite-state transducers. The
present paper extends this work by allowing a limited form of backreferencing
in such rules. The explicit use of backreferencing leads to more elegant and
general solutions.
