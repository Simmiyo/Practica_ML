How Predictable is Your State? Leveraging Lexical and Contextual
  Information for Predicting Legislative Floor Action at the State Level
Modeling U.S. Congressional legislation and roll-call votes has received
significant attention in previous literature. However, while legislators across
50 state governments and D.C. propose over 100,000 bills each year, and on
average enact over 30% of them, state level analysis has received relatively
less attention due in part to the difficulty in obtaining the necessary data.
Since each state legislature is guided by their own procedures, politics and
issues, however, it is difficult to qualitatively asses the factors that affect
the likelihood of a legislative initiative succeeding. Herein, we present
several methods for modeling the likelihood of a bill receiving floor action
across all 50 states and D.C. We utilize the lexical content of over 1 million
bills, along with contextual legislature and legislator derived features to
build our predictive models, allowing a comparison of the factors that are
important to the lawmaking process. Furthermore, we show that these signals
hold complementary predictive power, together achieving an average improvement
in accuracy of 18% over state specific baselines.
