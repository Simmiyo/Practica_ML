Is Word Sense Disambiguation just one more NLP task?
This paper compares the tasks of part-of-speech (POS) tagging and
word-sense-tagging or disambiguation (WSD), and argues that the tasks are not
related by fineness of grain or anything like that, but are quite different
kinds of task, particularly becuase there is nothing in POS corresponding to
sense novelty. The paper also argues for the reintegration of sub-tasks that
are being separated for evaluation
