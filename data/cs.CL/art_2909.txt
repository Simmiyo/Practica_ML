The CLaC Discourse Parser at CoNLL-2015
This paper describes our submission (kosseim15) to the CoNLL-2015 shared task
on shallow discourse parsing. We used the UIMA framework to develop our parser
and used ClearTK to add machine learning functionality to the UIMA framework.
Overall, our parser achieves a result of 17.3 F1 on the identification of
discourse relations on the blind CoNLL-2015 test set, ranking in sixth place.
