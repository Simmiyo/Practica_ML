It is not all downhill from here: Syllable Contact Law in Persian
Syllable contact pairs crosslinguistically tend to have a falling sonority
slope a constraint which is called the Syllable Contact Law SCL In this study
the phonotactics of syllable contacts in 4202 CVCCVC words of Persian lexicon
is investigated The consonants of Persian were divided into five sonority
categories and the frequency of all possible sonority slopes is computed both
in lexicon type frequency and in corpus token frequency Since an unmarked
phonological structure has been shown to diachronically become more frequent we
expect to see the same pattern for syllable contact pairs with falling sonority
slope The correlation of sonority categories of the two consonants in a
syllable contact pair is measured using Pointwise Mutual Information
