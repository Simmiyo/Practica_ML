Unsupervised Spoken Term Detection with Spoken Queries by Multi-level
  Acoustic Patterns with Varying Model Granularity
This paper presents a new approach for unsupervised Spoken Term Detection
with spoken queries using multiple sets of acoustic patterns automatically
discovered from the target corpus. The different pattern HMM
configurations(number of states per model, number of distinct models, number of
Gaussians per state)form a three-dimensional model granularity space. Different
sets of acoustic patterns automatically discovered on different points properly
distributed over this three-dimensional space are complementary to one another,
thus can jointly capture the characteristics of the spoken terms. By
representing the spoken content and spoken query as sequences of acoustic
patterns, a series of approaches for matching the pattern index sequences while
considering the signal variations are developed. In this way, not only the
on-line computation load can be reduced, but the signal distributions caused by
different speakers and acoustic conditions can be reasonably taken care of. The
results indicate that this approach significantly outperformed the unsupervised
feature-based DTW baseline by 16.16\% in mean average precision on the TIMIT
corpus.
