Machine-Translation History and Evolution: Survey for Arabic-English
  Translations
As a result of the rapid changes in information and communication technology
(ICT), the world has become a small village where people from all over the
world connect with each other in dialogue and communication via the Internet.
Also, communications have become a daily routine activity due to the new
globalization where companies and even universities become global residing
cross countries borders. As a result, translation becomes a needed activity in
this connected world. ICT made it possible to have a student in one country
take a course or even a degree from a different country anytime anywhere
easily. The resulted communication still needs a language as a means that helps
the receiver understands the contents of the sent message. People need an
automated translation application because human translators are hard to find
all the times, and the human translations are very expensive comparing to the
translations automated process. Several types of research describe the
electronic process of the Machine-Translation. In this paper, the authors are
going to study some of these previous researches, and they will explore some of
the needed tools for the Machine-Translation. This research is going to
contribute to the Machine-Translation area by helping future researchers to
have a summary for the Machine-Translation groups of research and to let lights
on the importance of the translation mechanism.
