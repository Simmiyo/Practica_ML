Fuzzy paraphrases in learning word representations with a lexicon
A synonym of a polysemous word is usually only the paraphrase of one sense
among many. When lexicons are used to improve vector-space word
representations, such paraphrases are unreliable and bring noise to the
vector-space. The prior works use a coefficient to adjust the overall learning
of the lexicons. They regard the paraphrases equally. In this paper, we propose
a novel approach that regards the paraphrases diversely to alleviate the
adverse effects of polysemy. We annotate each paraphrase with a degree of
reliability. The paraphrases are randomly eliminated according to the degrees
when our model learns word representations. In this way, our approach drops the
unreliable paraphrases, keeping more reliable paraphrases at the same time. The
experimental results show that the proposed method improves the word vectors.
Our approach is an attempt to address the polysemy problem keeping one vector
per word. It makes the approach easier to use than the conventional methods
that estimate multiple vectors for a word. Our approach also outperforms the
prior works in the experiments.
