Improving Tagging Performance by Using Voting Taggers
We present a bootstrapping method to develop an annotated corpus, which is
specially useful for languages with few available resources. The method is
being applied to develop a corpus of Spanish of over 5Mw. The method consists
on taking advantage of the collaboration of two different POS taggers. The
cases in which both taggers agree present a higher accuracy and are used to
retrain the taggers.
