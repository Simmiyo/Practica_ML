AppTechMiner: Mining Applications and Techniques from Scientific
  Articles
This paper presents AppTechMiner, a rule-based information extraction
framework that automatically constructs a knowledge base of all application
areas and problem solving techniques. Techniques include tools, methods,
datasets or evaluation metrics. We also categorize individual research articles
based on their application areas and the techniques proposed/improved in the
article. Our system achieves high average precision (~82%) and recall (~84%) in
knowledge base creation. It also performs well in application and technique
assignment to an individual article (average accuracy ~66%). In the end, we
further present two use cases presenting a trivial information retrieval system
and an extensive temporal analysis of the usage of techniques and application
areas. At present, we demonstrate the framework for the domain of computational
linguistics but this can be easily generalized to any other field of research.
