On the Complexity and Typology of Inflectional Morphological Systems
We quantify the linguistic complexity of different languages' morphological
systems. We verify that there is an empirical trade-off between paradigm size
and irregularity: a language's inflectional paradigms may be either large in
size or highly irregular, but never both. Our methodology measures paradigm
irregularity as the entropy of the surface realization of a paradigm -- how
hard it is to jointly predict all the surface forms of a paradigm. We estimate
this by a variational approximation. Our measurements are taken on large
morphological paradigms from 31 typologically diverse languages.
