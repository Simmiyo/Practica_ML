Helping Crisis Responders Find the Informative Needle in the Tweet
  Haystack
Crisis responders are increasingly using social media, data and other digital
sources of information to build a situational understanding of a crisis
situation in order to design an effective response. However with the increased
availability of such data, the challenge of identifying relevant information
from it also increases. This paper presents a successful automatic approach to
handling this problem. Messages are filtered for informativeness based on a
definition of the concept drawn from prior research and crisis response
experts. Informative messages are tagged for actionable data -- for example,
people in need, threats to rescue efforts, changes in environment, and so on.
In all, eight categories of actionability are identified. The two components --
informativeness and actionability classification -- are packaged together as an
openly-available tool called Emina (Emergent Informativeness and
Actionability).
