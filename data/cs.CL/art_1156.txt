Automated Word Prediction in Bangla Language Using Stochastic Language
  Models
Word completion and word prediction are two important phenomena in typing
that benefit users who type using keyboard or other similar devices. They can
have profound impact on the typing of disable people. Our work is based on word
prediction on Bangla sentence by using stochastic, i.e. N-gram language model
such as unigram, bigram, trigram, deleted Interpolation and backoff models for
auto completing a sentence by predicting a correct word in a sentence which
saves time and keystrokes of typing and also reduces misspelling. We use large
data corpus of Bangla language of different word types to predict correct word
with the accuracy as much as possible. We have found promising results. We hope
that our work will impact on the baseline for automated Bangla typing.
