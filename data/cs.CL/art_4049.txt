Finding Convincing Arguments Using Scalable Bayesian Preference Learning
We introduce a scalable Bayesian preference learning method for identifying
convincing arguments in the absence of gold-standard rat- ings or rankings. In
contrast to previous work, we avoid the need for separate methods to perform
quality control on training data, predict rankings and perform pairwise
classification. Bayesian approaches are an effective solution when faced with
sparse or noisy training data, but have not previously been used to identify
convincing arguments. One issue is scalability, which we address by developing
a stochastic variational inference method for Gaussian process (GP) preference
learning. We show how our method can be applied to predict argument
convincingness from crowdsourced data, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art, particularly when trained with small amounts of unreliable
data. We demonstrate how the Bayesian approach enables more effective active
learning, thereby reducing the amount of data required to identify convincing
arguments for new users and domains. While word embeddings are principally used
with neural networks, our results show that word embeddings in combination with
linguistic features also benefit GPs when predicting argument convincingness.
