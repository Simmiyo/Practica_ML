An Ensemble Model for Sentiment Analysis of Hindi-English Code-Mixed
  Data
In multilingual societies like India, code-mixed social media texts comprise
the majority of the Internet. Detecting the sentiment of the code-mixed user
opinions plays a crucial role in understanding social, economic and political
trends. In this paper, we propose an ensemble of character-trigrams based LSTM
model and word-ngrams based Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) model to identify the
sentiments of Hindi-English (Hi-En) code-mixed data. The ensemble model
combines the strengths of rich sequential patterns from the LSTM model and
polarity of keywords from the probabilistic ngram model to identify sentiments
in sparse and inconsistent code-mixed data. Experiments on reallife user
code-mixed data reveals that our approach yields state-of-the-art results as
compared to several baselines and other deep learning based proposed methods.
