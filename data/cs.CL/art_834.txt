A Modality Lexicon and its use in Automatic Tagging
This paper describes our resource-building results for an eight-week JHU
Human Language Technology Center of Excellence Summer Camp for Applied Language
Exploration (SCALE-2009) on Semantically-Informed Machine Translation.
Specifically, we describe the construction of a modality annotation scheme, a
modality lexicon, and two automated modality taggers that were built using the
lexicon and annotation scheme. Our annotation scheme is based on identifying
three components of modality: a trigger, a target and a holder. We describe how
our modality lexicon was produced semi-automatically, expanding from an initial
hand-selected list of modality trigger words and phrases. The resulting
expanded modality lexicon is being made publicly available. We demonstrate that
one tagger---a structure-based tagger---results in precision around 86%
(depending on genre) for tagging of a standard LDC data set. In a machine
translation application, using the structure-based tagger to annotate English
modalities on an English-Urdu training corpus improved the translation quality
score for Urdu by 0.3 Bleu points in the face of sparse training data.
