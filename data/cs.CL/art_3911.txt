A Study on Dialog Act Recognition using Character-Level Tokenization
Dialog act recognition is an important step for dialog systems since it
reveals the intention behind the uttered words. Most approaches on the task use
word-level tokenization. In contrast, this paper explores the use of
character-level tokenization. This is relevant since there is information at
the sub-word level that is related to the function of the words and, thus,
their intention. We also explore the use of different context windows around
each token, which are able to capture important elements, such as affixes.
Furthermore, we assess the importance of punctuation and capitalization. We
performed experiments on both the Switchboard Dialog Act Corpus and the DIHANA
Corpus. In both cases, the experiments not only show that character-level
tokenization leads to better performance than the typical word-level
approaches, but also that both approaches are able to capture complementary
information. Thus, the best results are achieved by combining tokenization at
both levels.
