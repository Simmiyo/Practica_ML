Extending the adverbial coverage of a NLP oriented resource for French
This paper presents a work on extending the adverbial entries of LGLex: a NLP
oriented syntactic resource for French. Adverbs were extracted from the
Lexicon-Grammar tables of both simple adverbs ending in -ment '-ly' (Molinier
and Levrier, 2000) and compound adverbs (Gross, 1986; 1990). This work relies
on the exploitation of fine-grained linguistic information provided in existing
resources. Various features are encoded in both LG tables and they haven't been
exploited yet. They describe the relations of deleting, permuting, intensifying
and paraphrasing that associate, on the one hand, the simple and compound
adverbs and, on the other hand, different types of compound adverbs. The
resulting syntactic resource is manually evaluated and freely available under
the LGPL-LR license.
