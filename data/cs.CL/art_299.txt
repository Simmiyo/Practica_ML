Unification of multi-lingual scientific terminological resources using
  the ISO 16642 standard. The TermSciences initiative
This paper presents the TermSciences portal, which deals with the
implementation of a conceptual model that uses the recent ISO 16642 standard
(Terminological Markup Framework). This standard turns out to be suitable for
concept modeling since it allowed for organizing the original resources by
concepts and to associate the various terms for a given concept. Additional
structuring is produced by sharing conceptual relationships, that is,
cross-linking of resource results through the introduction of semantic
relations which may have initially be missing.
