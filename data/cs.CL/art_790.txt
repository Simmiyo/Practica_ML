Jabalin: a Comprehensive Computational Model of Modern Standard Arabic
  Verbal Morphology Based on Traditional Arabic Prosody
The computational handling of Modern Standard Arabic is a challenge in the
field of natural language processing due to its highly rich morphology.
However, several authors have pointed out that the Arabic morphological system
is in fact extremely regular. The existing Arabic morphological analyzers have
exploited this regularity to variable extent, yet we believe there is still
some scope for improvement. Taking inspiration in traditional Arabic prosody,
we have designed and implemented a compact and simple morphological system
which in our opinion takes further advantage of the regularities encountered in
the Arabic morphological system. The output of the system is a large-scale
lexicon of inflected forms that has subsequently been used to create an Online
Interface for a morphological analyzer of Arabic verbs. The Jabalin Online
Interface is available at http://elvira.lllf.uam.es/jabalin/, hosted at the
LLI-UAM lab. The generation system is also available under a GNU GPL 3 license.
