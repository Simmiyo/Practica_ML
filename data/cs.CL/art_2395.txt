Comparison of SMT and RBMT; The Requirement of Hybridization for
  Marathi-Hindi MT
We present in this paper our work on comparison between Statistical Machine
Translation (SMT) and Rule-based machine translation for translation from
Marathi to Hindi. Rule Based systems although robust take lots of time to
build. On the other hand statistical machine translation systems are easier to
create, maintain and improve upon. We describe the development of a basic
Marathi-Hindi SMT system and evaluate its performance. Through a detailed error
analysis, we, point out the relative strengths and weaknesses of both systems.
Effectively, we shall see that even with a small amount of training corpus a
statistical machine translation system has many advantages for high quality
domain specific machine translation over that of a rule-based counterpart.
