Toward a full-scale neural machine translation in production: the
  Booking.com use case
While some remarkable progress has been made in neural machine translation
(NMT) research, there have not been many reports on its development and
evaluation in practice. This paper tries to fill this gap by presenting some of
our findings from building an in-house travel domain NMT system in a large
scale E-commerce setting. The three major topics that we cover are optimization
and training (including different optimization strategies and corpus sizes),
handling real-world content and evaluating results.
