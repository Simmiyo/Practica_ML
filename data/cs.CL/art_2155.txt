Sequential Matching Network: A New Architecture for Multi-turn Response
  Selection in Retrieval-based Chatbots
We study response selection for multi-turn conversation in retrieval-based
chatbots. Existing work either concatenates utterances in context or matches a
response with a highly abstract context vector finally, which may lose
relationships among utterances or important contextual information. We propose
a sequential matching network (SMN) to address both problems. SMN first matches
a response with each utterance in the context on multiple levels of
granularity, and distills important matching information from each pair as a
vector with convolution and pooling operations. The vectors are then
accumulated in a chronological order through a recurrent neural network (RNN)
which models relationships among utterances. The final matching score is
calculated with the hidden states of the RNN. An empirical study on two public
data sets shows that SMN can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods
for response selection in multi-turn conversation.
