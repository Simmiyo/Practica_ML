General Purpose Textual Sentiment Analysis and Emotion Detection Tools
Textual sentiment analysis and emotion detection consists in retrieving the
sentiment or emotion carried by a text or document. This task can be useful in
many domains: opinion mining, prediction, feedbacks, etc. However, building a
general purpose tool for doing sentiment analysis and emotion detection raises
a number of issues, theoretical issues like the dependence to the domain or to
the language but also pratical issues like the emotion representation for
interoperability. In this paper we present our sentiment/emotion analysis
tools, the way we propose to circumvent the di culties and the applications
they are used for.
