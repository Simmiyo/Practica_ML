Evolution of the Modern Phase of Written Bangla: A Statistical Study
Active languages such as Bangla (or Bengali) evolve over time due to a
variety of social, cultural, economic, and political issues. In this paper, we
analyze the change in the written form of the modern phase of Bangla
quantitatively in terms of character-level, syllable-level, morpheme-level and
word-level features. We collect three different types of corpora---classical,
newspapers and blogs---and test whether the differences in their features are
statistically significant. Results suggest that there are significant changes
in the length of a word when measured in terms of characters, but there is not
much difference in usage of different characters, syllables and morphemes in a
word or of different words in a sentence. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work on Bangla of this kind.
