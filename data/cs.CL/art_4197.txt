Pragmatic approach to structured data querying via natural language
  interface
As the use of technology increases and data analysis becomes integral in many
businesses, the ability to quickly access and interpret data has become more
important than ever. Information retrieval technologies are being utilized by
organizations and companies to manage their information systems and processes.
Despite information retrieval of a large amount of data being efficient
organized in relational databases, a user still needs to master the DB
language/schema to completely formulate the queries. This puts a burden on
organizations and companies to hire employees that are proficient in DB
languages/schemas to formulate queries. To reduce some of the burden on already
overstretched data teams, many organizations are looking for tools that allow
non-developers to query their databases. Unfortunately, writing a valid SQL
query that answers the question a user is trying to ask isn't always easy. Even
seemingly simple questions, like "Which start-up companies received more than
$200M in funding?" can actually be very hard to answer, let alone convert into
a SQL query. How do you define start-up companies? By size, location, duration
of time they have been incorporated? This may be fine if a user is working with
a database they're already familiar with, but what if users are not familiar
with the database. What is needed is a centralized system that can effectively
translate natural language queries into specific database queries for different
customer database types. There is a number of factors that can dramatically
affect the system architecture and the set of algorithms used to translate NL
queries into a structured query representation.
