Content Translation: Computer-assisted translation tool for Wikipedia
  articles
The quality and quantity of articles in each Wikipedia language varies
greatly. Translating from another Wikipedia is a natural way to add more
content, but the translation process is not properly supported in the software
used by Wikipedia. Past computer-assisted translation tools built for Wikipedia
are not commonly used. We created a tool that adapts to the specific needs of
an open community and to the kind of content in Wikipedia. Qualitative and
quantitative data indicates that the new tool helps users translate articles
easier and faster.
