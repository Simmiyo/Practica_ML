Meta-evaluation of comparability metrics using parallel corpora
Metrics for measuring the comparability of corpora or texts need to be
developed and evaluated systematically. Applications based on a corpus, such as
training Statistical MT systems in specialised narrow domains, require finding
a reasonable balance between the size of the corpus and its consistency, with
controlled and benchmarked levels of comparability for any newly added
sections. In this article we propose a method that can meta-evaluate
comparability metrics by calculating monolingual comparability scores
separately on the 'source' and 'target' sides of parallel corpora. The range of
scores on the source side is then correlated (using Pearson's r coefficient)
with the range of 'target' scores; the higher the correlation - the more
reliable is the metric. The intuition is that a good metric should yield the
same distance between different domains in different languages. Our method
gives consistent results for the same metrics on different data sets, which
indicates that it is reliable and can be used for metric comparison or for
optimising settings of parametrised metrics.
