Fast, Small and Exact: Infinite-order Language Modelling with Compressed
  Suffix Trees
Efficient methods for storing and querying are critical for scaling
high-order n-gram language models to large corpora. We propose a language model
based on compressed suffix trees, a representation that is highly compact and
can be easily held in memory, while supporting queries needed in computing
language model probabilities on-the-fly. We present several optimisations which
improve query runtimes up to 2500x, despite only incurring a modest increase in
construction time and memory usage. For large corpora and high Markov orders,
our method is highly competitive with the state-of-the-art KenLM package. It
imposes much lower memory requirements, often by orders of magnitude, and has
runtimes that are either similar (for training) or comparable (for querying).
