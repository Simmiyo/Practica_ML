Clickbait Detection in Tweets Using Self-attentive Network
Clickbait detection in tweets remains an elusive challenge. In this paper, we
describe the solution for the Zingel Clickbait Detector at the Clickbait
Challenge 2017, which is capable of evaluating each tweet's level of click
baiting. We first reformat the regression problem as a multi-classification
problem, based on the annotation scheme. To perform multi-classification, we
apply a token-level, self-attentive mechanism on the hidden states of
bi-directional Gated Recurrent Units (biGRU), which enables the model to
generate tweets' task-specific vector representations by attending to important
tokens. The self-attentive neural network can be trained end-to-end, without
involving any manual feature engineering. Our detector ranked first in the
final evaluation of Clickbait Challenge 2017.
