An Ontology for Comprehensive Tutoring of Euphonic Conjunctions of
  Sanskrit Grammar
Euphonic conjunctions (sandhis) form a very important aspect of Sanskrit
morphology and phonology. The traditional and modern methods of studying about
euphonic conjunctions in Sanskrit follow different methodologies. The former
involves a rigorous study of the Paninian system embodied in Panini's
Ashtadhyayi, while the latter usually involves the study of a few important
sandhi rules with the use of examples. The former is not suitable for
beginners, and the latter, not sufficient to gain a comprehensive understanding
of the operation of sandhi rules. This is so since there are not only numerous
sandhi rules and exceptions, but also complex precedence rules involved. The
need for a new ontology for sandhi-tutoring was hence felt. This work presents
a comprehensive ontology designed to enable a student-user to learn in stages
all about euphonic conjunctions and the relevant aphorisms of Sanskrit grammar
and to test and evaluate the progress of the student-user. The ontology forms
the basis of a multimedia sandhi tutor that was given to different categories
of users including Sanskrit scholars for extensive and rigorous testing.
