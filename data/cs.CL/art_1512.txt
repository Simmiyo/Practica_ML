Dual Language Models for Code Switched Speech Recognition
In this work, we present a simple and elegant approach to language modeling
for bilingual code-switched text. Since code-switching is a blend of two or
more different languages, a standard bilingual language model can be improved
upon by using structures of the monolingual language models. We propose a novel
technique called dual language models, which involves building two
complementary monolingual language models and combining them using a
probabilistic model for switching between the two. We evaluate the efficacy of
our approach using a conversational Mandarin-English speech corpus. We prove
the robustness of our model by showing significant improvements in perplexity
measures over the standard bilingual language model without the use of any
external information. Similar consistent improvements are also reflected in
automatic speech recognition error rates.
