Plurals: individuals and sets in a richly typed semantics
We developed a type-theoretical framework for natural lan- guage semantics
that, in addition to the usual Montagovian treatment of compositional
semantics, includes a treatment of some phenomena of lex- ical semantic:
coercions, meaning, transfers, (in)felicitous co-predication. In this setting
we see how the various readings of plurals (collective, dis- tributive,
coverings,...) can be modelled.
