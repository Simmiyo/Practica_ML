Spoken SQuAD: A Study of Mitigating the Impact of Speech Recognition
  Errors on Listening Comprehension
Reading comprehension has been widely studied. One of the most representative
reading comprehension tasks is Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD), on
which machine is already comparable with human. On the other hand, accessing
large collections of multimedia or spoken content is much more difficult and
time-consuming than plain text content for humans. It's therefore highly
attractive to develop machines which can automatically understand spoken
content. In this paper, we propose a new listening comprehension task - Spoken
SQuAD. On the new task, we found that speech recognition errors have
catastrophic impact on machine comprehension, and several approaches are
proposed to mitigate the impact.
