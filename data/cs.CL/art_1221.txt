Very Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Robust Speech Recognition
This paper describes the extension and optimization of our previous work on
very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for effective recognition of
noisy speech in the Aurora 4 task. The appropriate number of convolutional
layers, the sizes of the filters, pooling operations and input feature maps are
all modified: the filter and pooling sizes are reduced and dimensions of input
feature maps are extended to allow adding more convolutional layers.
Furthermore appropriate input padding and input feature map selection
strategies are developed. In addition, an adaptation framework using joint
training of very deep CNN with auxiliary features i-vector and fMLLR features
is developed. These modifications give substantial word error rate reductions
over the standard CNN used as baseline. Finally the very deep CNN is combined
with an LSTM-RNN acoustic model and it is shown that state-level weighted log
likelihood score combination in a joint acoustic model decoding scheme is very
effective. On the Aurora 4 task, the very deep CNN achieves a WER of 8.81%,
further 7.99% with auxiliary feature joint training, and 7.09% with LSTM-RNN
joint decoding.
