Supertagging: Introduction, learning, and application
Supertagging is an approach originally developed by Bangalore and Joshi
(1999) to improve the parsing efficiency. In the beginning, the scholars used
small training datasets and somewhat na\"ive smoothing techniques to learn the
probability distributions of supertags. Since its inception, the applicability
of Supertags has been explored for TAG (tree-adjoining grammar) formalism as
well as other related yet, different formalisms such as CCG. This article will
try to summarize the various chapters, relevant to statistical parsing, from
the most recent edited book volume (Bangalore and Joshi, 2010). The chapters
were selected so as to blend the learning of supertags, its integration into
full-scale parsing, and in semantic parsing.
