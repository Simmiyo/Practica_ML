Untangling the GDPR Using ConRelMiner
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) poses enormous challenges on
companies and organizations with respect to understanding, implementing, and
maintaining the contained constraints. We report on how the ConRelMiner method
can be used for untangling the GDPR. For this, the GDPR is filtered and grouped
along the roles mentioned by the GDPR and the reduction of sentences to be read
by analysts is shown. Moreover, the output of the ConRelMiner - a cluster graph
with relations between the sentences - is displayed and interpreted. Overall
the goal is to illustrate how the effort for implementing the GDPR can be
reduced and a structured and meaningful representation of the relevant GDPR
sentences can be found.
