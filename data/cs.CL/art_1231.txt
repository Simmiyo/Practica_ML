Word2Vec vs DBnary: Augmenting METEOR using Vector Representations or
  Lexical Resources?
This paper presents an approach combining lexico-semantic resources and
distributed representations of words applied to the evaluation in machine
translation (MT). This study is made through the enrichment of a well-known MT
evaluation metric: METEOR. This metric enables an approximate match (synonymy
or morphological similarity) between an automatic and a reference translation.
Our experiments are made in the framework of the Metrics task of WMT 2014. We
show that distributed representations are a good alternative to lexico-semantic
resources for MT evaluation and they can even bring interesting additional
information. The augmented versions of METEOR, using vector representations,
are made available on our Github page.
