Phylogenetics of Indo-European Language families via an
  Algebro-Geometric Analysis of their Syntactic Structures
Using Phylogenetic Algebraic Geometry, we analyze computationally the
phylogenetic tree of subfamilies of the Indo-European language family, using
data of syntactic structures. The two main sources of syntactic data are the
SSWL database and Longobardi's recent data of syntactic parameters. We compute
phylogenetic invariants and likelihood functions for two sets of Germanic
languages, a set of Romance languages, a set of Slavic languages and a set of
early Indo-European languages, and we compare the results with what is known
through historical linguistics.
