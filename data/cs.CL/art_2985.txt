CLaC at SemEval-2016 Task 11: Exploring linguistic and psycho-linguistic
  Features for Complex Word Identification
This paper describes the system deployed by the CLaC-EDLK team to the
"SemEval 2016, Complex Word Identification task". The goal of the task is to
identify if a given word in a given context is "simple" or "complex". Our
system relies on linguistic features and cognitive complexity. We used several
supervised models, however the Random Forest model outperformed the others.
Overall our best configuration achieved a G-score of 68.8% in the task, ranking
our system 21 out of 45.
