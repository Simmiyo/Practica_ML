ESLO: from transcription to speakers' personal information annotation
This paper presents the preliminary works to put online a French oral corpus
and its transcription. This corpus is the Socio-Linguistic Survey in Orleans,
realized in 1968. First, we numerized the corpus, then we handwritten
transcribed it with the Transcriber software adding different tags about
speakers, time, noise, etc. Each document (audio file and XML file of the
transcription) was described by a set of metadata stored in an XML format to
allow an easy consultation. Second, we added different levels of annotations,
recognition of named entities and annotation of personal information about
speakers. This two annotation tasks used the CasSys system of transducer
cascades. We used and modified a first cascade to recognize named entities.
Then we built a second cascade to annote the designating entities, i.e.
information about the speaker. These second cascade parsed the named entity
annotated corpus. The objective is to locate information about the speaker and,
also, what kind of information can designate him/her. These two cascades was
evaluated with precision and recall measures.
