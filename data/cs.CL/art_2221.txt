Shortcut Sequence Tagging
Deep stacked RNNs are usually hard to train. Adding shortcut connections
across different layers is a common way to ease the training of stacked
networks. However, extra shortcuts make the recurrent step more complicated. To
simply the stacked architecture, we propose a framework called shortcut block,
which is a marriage of the gating mechanism and shortcuts, while discarding the
self-connected part in LSTM cell. We present extensive empirical experiments
showing that this design makes training easy and improves generalization. We
propose various shortcut block topologies and compositions to explore its
effectiveness. Based on this architecture, we obtain a 6% relatively
improvement over the state-of-the-art on CCGbank supertagging dataset. We also
get comparable results on POS tagging task.
