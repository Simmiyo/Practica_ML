Inferring Narrative Causality between Event Pairs in Films
To understand narrative, humans draw inferences about the underlying
relations between narrative events. Cognitive theories of narrative
understanding define these inferences as four different types of causality,
that include pairs of events A, B where A physically causes B (X drop, X
break), to pairs of events where A causes emotional state B (Y saw X, Y felt
fear). Previous work on learning narrative relations from text has either
focused on "strict" physical causality, or has been vague about what relation
is being learned. This paper learns pairs of causal events from a corpus of
film scene descriptions which are action rich and tend to be told in
chronological order. We show that event pairs induced using our methods are of
high quality and are judged to have a stronger causal relation than event pairs
from Rel-grams.
