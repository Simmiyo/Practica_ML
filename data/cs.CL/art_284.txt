Verbal chunk extraction in French using limited resources
A way of extracting French verbal chunks, inflected and infinitive, is
explored and tested on effective corpus. Declarative morphological and local
grammar rules specifying chunks and some simple contextual structures are used,
relying on limited lexical information and some simple heuristic/statistic
properties obtained from restricted corpora. The specific goals, the
architecture and the formalism of the system, the linguistic information on
which it relies and the obtained results on effective corpus are presented.
