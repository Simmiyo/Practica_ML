Network Motifs Analysis of Croatian Literature
In this paper we analyse network motifs in the co-occurrence directed
networks constructed from five different texts (four books and one portal) in
the Croatian language. After preparing the data and network construction, we
perform the network motif analysis. We analyse the motif frequencies and
Z-scores in the five networks. We present the triad significance profile for
five datasets. Furthermore, we compare our results with the existing results
for the linguistic networks. Firstly, we show that the triad significance
profile for the Croatian language is very similar with the other languages and
all the networks belong to the same family of networks. However, there are
certain differences between the Croatian language and other analysed languages.
We conclude that this is due to the free word-order of the Croatian language.
