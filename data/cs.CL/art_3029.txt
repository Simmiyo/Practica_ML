Limitations of Cross-Lingual Learning from Image Search
Cross-lingual representation learning is an important step in making NLP
scale to all the world's languages. Recent work on bilingual lexicon induction
suggests that it is possible to learn cross-lingual representations of words
based on similarities between images associated with these words. However, that
work focused on the translation of selected nouns only. In our work, we
investigate whether the meaning of other parts-of-speech, in particular
adjectives and verbs, can be learned in the same way. We also experiment with
combining the representations learned from visual data with embeddings learned
from textual data. Our experiments across five language pairs indicate that
previous work does not scale to the problem of learning cross-lingual
representations beyond simple nouns.
