Narrative Variations in a Virtual Storyteller
Research on storytelling over the last 100 years has distinguished at least
two levels of narrative representation (1) story, or fabula; and (2) discourse,
or sujhet. We use this distinction to create Fabula Tales, a computational
framework for a virtual storyteller that can tell the same story in different
ways through the implementation of general narratological variations, such as
varying direct vs. indirect speech, character voice (style), point of view, and
focalization. A strength of our computational framework is that it is based on
very general methods for re-using existing story content, either from fables or
from personal narratives collected from blogs. We first explain how a simple
annotation tool allows naive annotators to easily create a deep representation
of fabula called a story intention graph, and show how we use this
representation to generate story tellings automatically. Then we present
results of two studies testing our narratological parameters, and showing that
different tellings affect the reader's perception of the story and characters.
