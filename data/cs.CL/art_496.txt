Grammatical Relations of Myanmar Sentences Augmented by
  Transformation-Based Learning of Function Tagging
In this paper we describe function tagging using Transformation Based
Learning (TBL) for Myanmar that is a method of extensions to the previous
statistics-based function tagger. Contextual and lexical rules (developed using
TBL) were critical in achieving good results. First, we describe a method for
expressing lexical relations in function tagging that statistical function
tagging are currently unable to express. Function tagging is the preprocessing
step to show grammatical relations of the sentences. Then we use the context
free grammar technique to clarify the grammatical relations in Myanmar
sentences or to output the parse trees. The grammatical relations are the
functional structure of a language. They rely very much on the function tag of
the tokens. We augment the grammatical relations of Myanmar sentences with
transformation-based learning of function tagging.
