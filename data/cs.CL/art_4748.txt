Challenges for Toxic Comment Classification: An In-Depth Error Analysis
Toxic comment classification has become an active research field with many
recently proposed approaches. However, while these approaches address some of
the task's challenges others still remain unsolved and directions for further
research are needed. To this end, we compare different deep learning and
shallow approaches on a new, large comment dataset and propose an ensemble that
outperforms all individual models. Further, we validate our findings on a
second dataset. The results of the ensemble enable us to perform an extensive
error analysis, which reveals open challenges for state-of-the-art methods and
directions towards pending future research. These challenges include missing
paradigmatic context and inconsistent dataset labels.
