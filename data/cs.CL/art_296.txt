An elitist approach for extracting automatically well-realized speech
  sounds with high confidence
This paper presents an "elitist approach" for extracting automatically
well-realized speech sounds with high confidence. The elitist approach uses a
speech recognition system based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM). The HMM are
trained on speech sounds which are systematically well-detected in an iterative
procedure. The results show that, by using the HMM models defined in the
training phase, the speech recognizer detects reliably specific speech sounds
with a small rate of errors.
