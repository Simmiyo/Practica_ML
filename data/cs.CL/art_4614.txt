Étude de l'informativité des transcriptions : une approche basée
  sur le résumé automatique
In this paper we propose a new approach to evaluate the informativeness of
transcriptions coming from Automatic Speech Recognition systems. This approach,
based in the notion of informativeness, is focused on the framework of
Automatic Text Summarization performed over these transcriptions. At a first
glance we estimate the informative content of the various automatic
transcriptions, then we explore the capacity of Automatic Text Summarization to
overcome the informative loss. To do this we use an automatic summary
evaluation protocol without reference (based on the informative content), which
computes the divergence between probability distributions of different textual
representations: manual and automatic transcriptions and their summaries. After
a set of evaluations this analysis allowed us to judge both the quality of the
transcriptions in terms of informativeness and to assess the ability of
automatic text summarization to compensate the problems raised during the
transcription phase.
