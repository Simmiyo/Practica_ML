An implementation of Apertium based Assamese morphological analyzer
Morphological Analysis is an important branch of linguistics for any Natural
Language Processing Technology. Morphology studies the word structure and
formation of word of a language. In current scenario of NLP research,
morphological analysis techniques have become more popular day by day. For
processing any language, morphology of the word should be first analyzed.
Assamese language contains very complex morphological structure. In our work we
have used Apertium based Finite-State-Transducers for developing morphological
analyzer for Assamese Language with some limited domain and we get 72.7%
accuracy
