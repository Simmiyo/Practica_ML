Effective Neural Solution for Multi-Criteria Word Segmentation
We present a simple yet elegant solution to train a single joint model on
multi-criteria corpora for Chinese Word Segmentation (CWS). Our novel design
requires no private layers in model architecture, instead, introduces two
artificial tokens at the beginning and ending of input sentence to specify the
required target criteria. The rest of the model including Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) layer and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) layer remains
unchanged and is shared across all datasets, keeping the size of parameter
collection minimal and constant. On Bakeoff 2005 and Bakeoff 2008 datasets, our
innovative design has surpassed both single-criterion and multi-criteria
state-of-the-art learning results. To the best knowledge, our design is the
first one that has achieved the latest high performance on such large scale
datasets. Source codes and corpora of this paper are available on GitHub.
