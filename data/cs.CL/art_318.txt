A Formal Model of Dictionary Structure and Content
We show that a general model of lexical information conforms to an abstract
model that reflects the hierarchy of information found in a typical dictionary
entry. We show that this model can be mapped into a well-formed XML document,
and how the XSL transformation language can be used to implement a semantics
defined over the abstract model to enable extraction and manipulation of the
information in any format.
