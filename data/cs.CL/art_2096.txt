The MGB-2 Challenge: Arabic Multi-Dialect Broadcast Media Recognition
This paper describes the Arabic Multi-Genre Broadcast (MGB-2) Challenge for
SLT-2016. Unlike last year's English MGB Challenge, which focused on
recognition of diverse TV genres, this year, the challenge has an emphasis on
handling the diversity in dialect in Arabic speech. Audio data comes from 19
distinct programmes from the Aljazeera Arabic TV channel between March 2005 and
December 2015. Programmes are split into three groups: conversations,
interviews, and reports. A total of 1,200 hours have been released with lightly
supervised transcriptions for the acoustic modelling. For language modelling,
we made available over 110M words crawled from Aljazeera Arabic website
Aljazeera.net for a 10 year duration 2000-2011. Two lexicons have been
provided, one phoneme based and one grapheme based. Finally, two tasks were
proposed for this year's challenge: standard speech transcription, and word
alignment. This paper describes the task data and evaluation process used in
the MGB challenge, and summarises the results obtained.
