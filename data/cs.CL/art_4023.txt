Improving Dialogue Act Classification for Spontaneous Arabic Speech and
  Instant Messages at Utterance Level
The ability to model and automatically detect dialogue act is an important
step toward understanding spontaneous speech and Instant Messages. However, it
has been difficult to infer a dialogue act from a surface utterance because it
highly depends on the context of the utterance and speaker linguistic
knowledge; especially in Arabic dialects. This paper proposes a statistical
dialogue analysis model to recognize utterance's dialogue acts using a
multi-classes hierarchical structure. The model can automatically acquire
probabilistic discourse knowledge from a dialogue corpus were collected and
annotated manually from multi-genre Egyptian call-centers. Extensive
experiments were conducted using Support Vector Machines classifier to evaluate
the system performance. The results attained in the term of average F-measure
scores of 0.912; showed that the proposed approach has moderately improved
F-measure by approximately 20%.
