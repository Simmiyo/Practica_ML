An Inventory of Preposition Relations
We describe an inventory of semantic relations that are expressed by
prepositions. We define these relations by building on the word sense
disambiguation task for prepositions and propose a mapping from preposition
senses to the relation labels by collapsing semantically related senses across
prepositions.
