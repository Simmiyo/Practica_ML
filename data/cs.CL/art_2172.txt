Vicinity-Driven Paragraph and Sentence Alignment for Comparable Corpora
Parallel corpora have driven great progress in the field of Text
Simplification. However, most sentence alignment algorithms either offer a
limited range of alignment types supported, or simply ignore valuable clues
present in comparable documents. We address this problem by introducing a new
set of flexible vicinity-driven paragraph and sentence alignment algorithms
that 1-N, N-1, N-N and long distance null alignments without the need for
hard-to-replicate supervised models.
