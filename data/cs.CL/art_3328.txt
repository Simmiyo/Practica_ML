Siamese Neural Networks with Random Forest for detecting duplicate
  question pairs
Determining whether two given questions are semantically similar is a fairly
challenging task given the different structures and forms that the questions
can take. In this paper, we use Gated Recurrent Units(GRU) in combination with
other highly used machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Adaboost and
SVM for the similarity prediction task on a dataset released by Quora,
consisting of about 400k labeled question pairs. We got the best result by
using the Siamese adaptation of a Bidirectional GRU with a Random Forest
classifier, which landed us among the top 24% in the competition Quora Question
Pairs hosted on Kaggle.
