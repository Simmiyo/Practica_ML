Applying Distributional Compositional Categorical Models of Meaning to
  Language Translation
The aim of this paper is twofold: first we will use vector space
distributional compositional categorical models of meaning to compare the
meaning of sentences in Irish and in English (and thus ascertain when a
sentence is the translation of another sentence) using the cosine similarity
score. Then we shall outline a procedure which translates nouns by
understanding their context, using a conceptual space model of cognition. We
shall use metrics on the category ConvexRel to determine the distance between
concepts (and determine when a noun is the translation of another noun). This
paper will focus on applications to Irish, a member of the Gaelic family of
languages.
