USFD at KBP 2011: Entity Linking, Slot Filling and Temporal Bounding
This paper describes the University of Sheffield's entry in the 2011 TAC KBP
entity linking and slot filling tasks. We chose to participate in the
monolingual entity linking task, the monolingual slot filling task and the
temporal slot filling tasks. We set out to build a framework for
experimentation with knowledge base population. This framework was created, and
applied to multiple KBP tasks. We demonstrated that our proposed framework is
effective and suitable for collaborative development efforts, as well as useful
in a teaching environment. Finally we present results that, while very modest,
provide improvements an order of magnitude greater than our 2010 attempt.
