Input Scheme for Hindi Using Phonetic Mapping
Written Communication on Computers requires knowledge of writing text for the
desired language using Computer. Mostly people do not use any other language
besides English. This creates a barrier. To resolve this issue we have
developed a scheme to input text in Hindi using phonetic mapping scheme. Using
this scheme we generate intermediate code strings and match them with
pronunciations of input text. Our system show significant success over other
input systems available.
