SeerNet at SemEval-2018 Task 1: Domain Adaptation for Affect in Tweets
The paper describes the best performing system for the SemEval-2018 Affect in
Tweets (English) sub-tasks. The system focuses on the ordinal classification
and regression sub-tasks for valence and emotion. For ordinal classification
valence is classified into 7 different classes ranging from -3 to 3 whereas
emotion is classified into 4 different classes 0 to 3 separately for each
emotion namely anger, fear, joy and sadness. The regression sub-tasks estimate
the intensity of valence and each emotion. The system performs domain
adaptation of 4 different models and creates an ensemble to give the final
prediction. The proposed system achieved 1st position out of 75 teams which
participated in the fore-mentioned sub-tasks. We outperform the baseline model
by margins ranging from 49.2% to 76.4%, thus, pushing the state-of-the-art
significantly.
