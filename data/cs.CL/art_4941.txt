Ruuh: A Deep Learning Based Conversational Social Agent
Dialogue systems and conversational agents are becoming increasingly popular
in the modern society but building an agent capable of holding intelligent
conversation with its users is a challenging problem for artificial
intelligence. In this demo, we demonstrate a deep learning based conversational
social agent called "Ruuh" (facebook.com/Ruuh) designed by a team at Microsoft
India to converse on a wide range of topics. Ruuh needs to think beyond the
utilitarian notion of merely generating "relevant" responses and meet a wider
range of user social needs, like expressing happiness when user's favorite team
wins, sharing a cute comment on showing the pictures of the user's pet and so
on. The agent also needs to detect and respond to abusive language, sensitive
topics and trolling behavior of the users. Many of these problems pose
significant research challenges which will be demonstrated in our demo. Our
agent has interacted with over 2 million real world users till date which has
generated over 150 million user conversations.
