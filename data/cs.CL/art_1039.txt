A Light Sliding-Window Part-of-Speech Tagger for the Apertium
  Free/Open-Source Machine Translation Platform
This paper describes a free/open-source implementation of the light
sliding-window (LSW) part-of-speech tagger for the Apertium free/open-source
machine translation platform. Firstly, the mechanism and training process of
the tagger are reviewed, and a new method for incorporating linguistic rules is
proposed. Secondly, experiments are conducted to compare the performances of
the tagger under different window settings, with or without Apertium-style
"forbid" rules, with or without Constraint Grammar, and also with respect to
the traditional HMM tagger in Apertium.
