Trainable Referring Expression Generation using Overspecification
  Preferences
Referring expression generation (REG) models that use speaker-dependent
information require a considerable amount of training data produced by every
individual speaker, or may otherwise perform poorly. In this work we present a
simple REG experiment that allows the use of larger training data sets by
grouping speakers according to their overspecification preferences. Intrinsic
evaluation shows that this method generally outperforms the personalised method
found in previous work.
