Another Diversity-Promoting Objective Function for Neural Dialogue
  Generation
Although generation-based dialogue systems have been widely researched, the
response generations by most existing systems have very low diversities. The
most likely reason for this problem is Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with
Softmax Cross-Entropy (SCE) loss. MLE trains models to generate the most
frequent responses from enormous generation candidates, although in actual
dialogues there are various responses based on the context. In this paper, we
propose a new objective function called Inverse Token Frequency (ITF) loss,
which individually scales smaller loss for frequent token classes and larger
loss for rare token classes. This function encourages the model to generate
rare tokens rather than frequent tokens. It does not complicate the model and
its training is stable because we only replace the objective function. On the
OpenSubtitles dialogue dataset, our loss model establishes a state-of-the-art
DIST-1 of 7.56, which is the unigram diversity score, while maintaining a good
BLEU-1 score. On a Japanese Twitter replies dataset, our loss model achieves a
DIST-1 score comparable to the ground truth.
