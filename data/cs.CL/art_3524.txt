Studio Ousia's Quiz Bowl Question Answering System
In this chapter, we describe our question answering system, which was the
winning system at the Human-Computer Question Answering (HCQA) Competition at
the Thirty-first Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems
(NIPS). The competition requires participants to address a factoid question
answering task referred to as quiz bowl. To address this task, we use two novel
neural network models and combine these models with conventional information
retrieval models using a supervised machine learning model. Our system achieved
the best performance among the systems submitted in the competition and won a
match against six top human quiz experts by a wide margin.
