The Algorithmic Inflection of Russian and Generation of Grammatically
  Correct Text
We present a deterministic algorithm for Russian inflection. This algorithm
is implemented in a publicly available web-service www.passare.ru which
provides functions for inflection of single words, word matching and synthesis
of grammatically correct Russian text. The inflectional functions have been
tested against the annotated corpus of Russian language OpenCorpora.
