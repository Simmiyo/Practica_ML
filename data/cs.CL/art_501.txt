Recognizing Bangla Grammar using Predictive Parser
We describe a Context Free Grammar (CFG) for Bangla language and hence we
propose a Bangla parser based on the grammar. Our approach is very much general
to apply in Bangla Sentences and the method is well accepted for parsing a
language of a grammar. The proposed parser is a predictive parser and we
construct the parse table for recognizing Bangla grammar. Using the parse table
we recognize syntactical mistakes of Bangla sentences when there is no entry
for a terminal in the parse table. If a natural language can be successfully
parsed then grammar checking from this language becomes possible. The proposed
scheme is based on Top down parsing method and we have avoided the left
recursion of the CFG using the idea of left factoring.
