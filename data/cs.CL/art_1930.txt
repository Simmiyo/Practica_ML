Issues in evaluating semantic spaces using word analogies
The offset method for solving word analogies has become a standard evaluation
tool for vector-space semantic models: it is considered desirable for a space
to represent semantic relations as consistent vector offsets. We show that the
method's reliance on cosine similarity conflates offset consistency with
largely irrelevant neighborhood structure, and propose simple baselines that
should be used to improve the utility of the method in vector space evaluation.
