A Model-Driven Probabilistic Parser Generator
Existing probabilistic scanners and parsers impose hard constraints on the
way lexical and syntactic ambiguities can be resolved. Furthermore, traditional
grammar-based parsing tools are limited in the mechanisms they allow for taking
context into account. In this paper, we propose a model-driven tool that allows
for statistical language models with arbitrary probability estimators. Our work
on model-driven probabilistic parsing is built on top of ModelCC, a model-based
parser generator, and enables the probabilistic interpretation and resolution
of anaphoric, cataphoric, and recursive references in the disambiguation of
abstract syntax graphs. In order to prove the expression power of ModelCC, we
describe the design of a general-purpose natural language parser.
