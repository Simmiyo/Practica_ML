Logical analysis of natural language semantics to solve the problem of
  computer understanding
An object--oriented approach to create a natural language understanding
system is considered. The understanding program is a formal system built on the
base of predicative calculus. Horn's clauses are used as well--formed formulas.
An inference is based on the principle of resolution. Sentences of natural
language are represented in the view of typical predicate set. These predicates
describe physical objects and processes, abstract objects, categories and
semantic relations between objects. Predicates for concrete assertions are
saved in a database. To describe the semantics of classes for physical objects,
abstract concepts and processes, a knowledge base is applied. The proposed
representation of natural language sentences is a semantic net. Nodes of such
net are typical predicates. This approach is perspective as, firstly, such
typification of nodes facilitates essentially forming of processing algorithms
and object descriptions, secondly, the effectiveness of algorithms is increased
(particularly for the great number of nodes), thirdly, to describe the
semantics of words, encyclopedic knowledge is used, and this permits
essentially to extend the class of solved problems.
