Annotating Predicate-Argument Structure for a Parallel Treebank
We report on a recently initiated project which aims at building a
multi-layered parallel treebank of English and German. Particular attention is
devoted to a dedicated predicate-argument layer which is used for aligning
translationally equivalent sentences of the two languages. We describe both our
conceptual decisions and aspects of their technical realisation. We discuss
some selected problems and conclude with a few remarks on how this project
relates to similar projects in the field.
