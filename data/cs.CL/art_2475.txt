Automatic Classification of the Complexity of Nonfiction Texts in
  Portuguese for Early School Years
Recent research shows that most Brazilian students have serious problems
regarding their reading skills. The full development of this skill is key for
the academic and professional future of every citizen. Tools for classifying
the complexity of reading materials for children aim to improve the quality of
the model of teaching reading and text comprehension. For English, Fengs work
[11] is considered the state-of-art in grade level prediction and achieved 74%
of accuracy in automatically classifying 4 levels of textual complexity for
close school grades. There are no classifiers for nonfiction texts for close
grades in Portuguese. In this article, we propose a scheme for manual
annotation of texts in 5 grade levels, which will be used for customized
reading to avoid the lack of interest by students who are more advanced in
reading and the blocking of those that still need to make further progress. We
obtained 52% of accuracy in classifying texts into 5 levels and 74% in 3
levels. The results prove to be promising when compared to the state-of-art
work.9
