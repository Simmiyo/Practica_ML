Polarity sensitivity and evaluation order in type-logical grammar
We present a novel, type-logical analysis of_polarity sensitivity_: how
negative polarity items (like "any" and "ever") or positive ones (like "some")
are licensed or prohibited. It takes not just scopal relations but also linear
order into account, using the programming-language notions of delimited
continuations and evaluation order, respectively. It thus achieves greater
empirical coverage than previous proposals.
