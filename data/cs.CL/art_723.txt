Quantifying literature quality using complexity criteria
We measured entropy and symbolic diversity for English and Spanish texts
including literature Nobel laureates and other famous authors. Entropy, symbol
diversity and symbol frequency profiles were compared for these four groups. We
also built a scale sensitive to the quality of writing and evaluated its
relationship with the Flesch's readability index for English and the
Szigriszt's perspicuity index for Spanish. Results suggest a correlation
between entropy and word diversity with quality of writing. Text genre also
influences the resulting entropy and diversity of the text. Results suggest the
plausibility of automated quality assessment of texts.
