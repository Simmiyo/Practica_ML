Tübingen-Oslo system: Linear regression works the best at Predicting
  Current and Future Psychological Health from Childhood Essays in the CLPsych
  2018 Shared Task
This paper describes our efforts in predicting current and future
psychological health from childhood essays within the scope of the CLPsych-2018
Shared Task. We experimented with a number of different models, including
recurrent and convolutional networks, Poisson regression, support vector
regression, and L1 and L2 regularized linear regression. We obtained the best
results on the training/development data with L2 regularized linear regression
(ridge regression) which also got the best scores on main metrics in the
official testing for task A (predicting psychological health from essays
written at the age of 11 years) and task B (predicting later psychological
health from essays written at the age of 11).
