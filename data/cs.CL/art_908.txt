Phrase database Approach to structural and semantic disambiguation in
  English-Korean Machine Translation
In machine translation it is common phenomenon that machine-readable
dictionaries and standard parsing rules are not enough to ensure accuracy in
parsing and translating English phrases into Korean language, which is revealed
in misleading translation results due to consequent structural and semantic
ambiguities. This paper aims to suggest a solution to structural and semantic
ambiguities due to the idiomaticity and non-grammaticalness of phrases commonly
used in English language by applying bilingual phrase database in
English-Korean Machine Translation (EKMT). This paper firstly clarifies what
the phrase unit in EKMT is based on the definition of the English phrase,
secondly clarifies what kind of language unit can be the target of the phrase
database for EKMT, thirdly suggests a way to build the phrase database by
presenting the format of the phrase database with examples, and finally
discusses briefly the method to apply this bilingual phrase database to the
EKMT for structural and semantic disambiguation.
