Machine Translation at Booking.com: Journey and Lessons Learned
We describe our recently developed neural machine translation (NMT) system
and benchmark it against our own statistical machine translation (SMT) system
as well as two other general purpose online engines (statistical and neural).
We present automatic and human evaluation results of the translation output
provided by each system. We also analyze the effect of sentence length on the
quality of output for SMT and NMT systems.
