Advances in All-Neural Speech Recognition
This paper advances the design of CTC-based all-neural (or end-to-end) speech
recognizers. We propose a novel symbol inventory, and a novel iterated-CTC
method in which a second system is used to transform a noisy initial output
into a cleaner version. We present a number of stabilization and initialization
methods we have found useful in training these networks. We evaluate our system
on the commonly used NIST 2000 conversational telephony test set, and
significantly exceed the previously published performance of similar systems,
both with and without the use of an external language model and decoding
technology.
