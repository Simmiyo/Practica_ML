Detecting Sockpuppets in Deceptive Opinion Spam
This paper explores the problem of sockpuppet detection in deceptive opinion
spam using authorship attribution and verification approaches. Two methods are
explored. The first is a feature subsampling scheme that uses the KL-Divergence
on stylistic language models of an author to find discriminative features. The
second is a transduction scheme, spy induction that leverages the diversity of
authors in the unlabeled test set by sending a set of spies (positive samples)
from the training set to retrieve hidden samples in the unlabeled test set
using nearest and farthest neighbors. Experiments using ground truth sockpuppet
data show the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.
