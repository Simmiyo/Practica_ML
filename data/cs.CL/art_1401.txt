Deep encoding of etymological information in TEI
This paper aims to provide a comprehensive modeling and representation of
etymological data in digital dictionaries. The purpose is to integrate in one
coherent framework both digital representations of legacy dictionaries, and
also born-digital lexical databases that are constructed manually or
semi-automatically. We want to propose a systematic and coherent set of
modeling principles for a variety of etymological phenomena that may contribute
to the creation of a continuum between existing and future lexical constructs,
where anyone interested in tracing the history of words and their meanings will
be able to seamlessly query lexical resources.Instead of designing an ad hoc
model and representation language for digital etymological data, we will focus
on identifying all the possibilities offered by the TEI guidelines for the
representation of lexical information.
