Outilex, plate-forme logicielle de traitement de textes écrits
The Outilex software platform, which will be made available to research,
development and industry, comprises software components implementing all the
fundamental operations of written text processing: processing without lexicons,
exploitation of lexicons and grammars, language resource management. All data
are structured in XML formats, and also in more compact formats, either
readable or binary, whenever necessary; the required format converters are
included in the platform; the grammar formats allow for combining statistical
approaches with resource-based approaches. Manually constructed lexicons for
French and English, originating from the LADL, and of substantial coverage,
will be distributed with the platform under LGPL-LR license.
