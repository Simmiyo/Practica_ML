Reduction of Intermediate Alphabets in Finite-State Transducer Cascades
This article describes an algorithm for reducing the intermediate alphabets
in cascades of finite-state transducers (FSTs). Although the method modifies
the component FSTs, there is no change in the overall relation described by the
whole cascade. No additional information or special algorithm, that could
decelerate the processing of input, is required at runtime. Two examples from
Natural Language Processing are used to illustrate the effect of the algorithm
on the sizes of the FSTs and their alphabets. With some FSTs the number of arcs
and symbols shrank considerably.
