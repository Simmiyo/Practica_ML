A Simple and Efficient Method To Generate Word Sense Representations
Distributed representations of words have boosted the performance of many
Natural Language Processing tasks. However, usually only one representation per
word is obtained, not acknowledging the fact that some words have multiple
meanings. This has a negative effect on the individual word representations and
the language model as a whole. In this paper we present a simple model that
enables recent techniques for building word vectors to represent distinct
senses of polysemic words. In our assessment of this model we show that it is
able to effectively discriminate between words' senses and to do so in a
computationally efficient manner.
