Residual Convolutional CTC Networks for Automatic Speech Recognition
Deep learning approaches have been widely used in Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) and they have achieved a significant accuracy improvement.
Especially, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been revisited in ASR
recently. However, most CNNs used in existing work have less than 10 layers
which may not be deep enough to capture all human speech signal information. In
this paper, we propose a novel deep and wide CNN architecture denoted as
RCNN-CTC, which has residual connections and Connectionist Temporal
Classification (CTC) loss function. RCNN-CTC is an end-to-end system which can
exploit temporal and spectral structures of speech signals simultaneously.
Furthermore, we introduce a CTC-based system combination, which is different
from the conventional frame-wise senone-based one. The basic subsystems adopted
in the combination are different types and thus mutually complementary to each
other. Experimental results show that our proposed single system RCNN-CTC can
achieve the lowest word error rate (WER) on WSJ and Tencent Chat data sets,
compared to several widely used neural network systems in ASR. In addition, the
proposed system combination can offer a further error reduction on these two
data sets, resulting in relative WER reductions of $14.91\%$ and $6.52\%$ on
WSJ dev93 and Tencent Chat data sets respectively.
