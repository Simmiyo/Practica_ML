Linear Segmentation and Segment Significance
We present a new method for discovering a segmental discourse structure of a
document while categorizing segment function. We demonstrate how retrieval of
noun phrases and pronominal forms, along with a zero-sum weighting scheme,
determines topicalized segmentation. Futhermore, we use term distribution to
aid in identifying the role that the segment performs in the document. Finally,
we present results of evaluation in terms of precision and recall which surpass
earlier approaches.
