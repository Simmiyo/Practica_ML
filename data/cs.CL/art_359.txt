Using descriptive mark-up to formalize translation quality assessment
The paper deals with using descriptive mark-up to emphasize translation
mistakes. The author postulates the necessity to develop a standard and formal
XML-based way of describing translation mistakes. It is considered to be
important for achieving impersonal translation quality assessment. Marked-up
translations can be used in corpus translation studies; moreover, automatic
translation assessment based on marked-up mistakes is possible. The paper
concludes with setting up guidelines for further activity within the described
field.
