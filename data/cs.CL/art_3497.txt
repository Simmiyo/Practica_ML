HFL-RC System at SemEval-2018 Task 11: Hybrid Multi-Aspects Model for
  Commonsense Reading Comprehension
This paper describes the system which got the state-of-the-art results at
SemEval-2018 Task 11: Machine Comprehension using Commonsense Knowledge. In
this paper, we present a neural network called Hybrid Multi-Aspects (HMA)
model, which mimic the human's intuitions on dealing with the multiple-choice
reading comprehension. In this model, we aim to produce the predictions in
multiple aspects by calculating attention among the text, question and choices,
and combine these results for final predictions. Experimental results show that
our HMA model could give substantial improvements over the baseline system and
got the first place on the final test set leaderboard with the accuracy of
84.13%.
