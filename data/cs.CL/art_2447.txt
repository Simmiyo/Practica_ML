Word-Alignment-Based Segment-Level Machine Translation Evaluation using
  Word Embeddings
One of the most important problems in machine translation (MT) evaluation is
to evaluate the similarity between translation hypotheses with different
surface forms from the reference, especially at the segment level. We propose
to use word embeddings to perform word alignment for segment-level MT
evaluation. We performed experiments with three types of alignment methods
using word embeddings. We evaluated our proposed methods with various
translation datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed methods
outperform previous word embeddings-based methods.
