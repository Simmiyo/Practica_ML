Automating Direct Speech Variations in Stories and Games
Dialogue authoring in large games requires not only content creation but the
subtlety of its delivery, which can vary from character to character. Manually
authoring this dialogue can be tedious, time-consuming, or even altogether
infeasible. This paper utilizes a rich narrative representation for modeling
dialogue and an expressive natural language generation engine for realizing it,
and expands upon a translation tool that bridges the two. We add functionality
to the translator to allow direct speech to be modeled by the narrative
representation, whereas the original translator supports only narratives told
by a third person narrator. We show that we can perform character substitution
in dialogues. We implement and evaluate a potential application to dialogue
implementation: generating dialogue for games with big, dynamic, or
procedurally-generated open worlds. We present a pilot study on human
perceptions of the personalities of characters using direct speech, assuming
unknown personality types at the time of authoring.
