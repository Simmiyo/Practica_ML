GU IRLAB at SemEval-2018 Task 7: Tree-LSTMs for Scientific Relation
  Classification
SemEval 2018 Task 7 focuses on relation ex- traction and classification in
scientific literature. In this work, we present our tree-based LSTM network for
this shared task. Our approach placed 9th (of 28) for subtask 1.1 (relation
classification), and 5th (of 20) for subtask 1.2 (relation classification with
noisy entities). We also provide an ablation study of features included as
input to the network.
