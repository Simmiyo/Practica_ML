A Trie-Structured Bayesian Model for Unsupervised Morphological
  Segmentation
In this paper, we introduce a trie-structured Bayesian model for unsupervised
morphological segmentation. We adopt prior information from different sources
in the model. We use neural word embeddings to discover words that are
morphologically derived from each other and thereby that are semantically
similar. We use letter successor variety counts obtained from tries that are
built by neural word embeddings. Our results show that using different
information sources such as neural word embeddings and letter successor variety
as prior information improves morphological segmentation in a Bayesian model.
Our model outperforms other unsupervised morphological segmentation models on
Turkish and gives promising results on English and German for scarce resources.
