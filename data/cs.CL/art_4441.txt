Guidelines and Annotation Framework for Arabic Author Profiling
In this paper, we present the annotation pipeline and the guidelines we wrote
as part of an effort to create a large manually annotated Arabic author
profiling dataset from various social media sources covering 16 Arabic
countries and 11 dialectal regions. The target size of the annotated ARAP-Tweet
corpus is more than 2.4 million words. We illustrate and summarize our general
and dialect-specific guidelines for each of the dialectal regions selected. We
also present the annotation framework and logistics. We control the annotation
quality frequently by computing the inter-annotator agreement during the
annotation process. Finally, we describe the issues encountered during the
annotation phase, especially those related to the peculiarities of Arabic
dialectal varieties as used in social media.
