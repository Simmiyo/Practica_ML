Building Morphological Chains for Agglutinative Languages
In this paper, we build morphological chains for agglutinative languages by
using a log-linear model for the morphological segmentation task. The model is
based on the unsupervised morphological segmentation system called
MorphoChains. We extend MorphoChains log linear model by expanding the
candidate space recursively to cover more split points for agglutinative
languages such as Turkish, whereas in the original model candidates are
generated by considering only binary segmentation of each word. The results
show that we improve the state-of-art Turkish scores by 12% having a F-measure
of 72% and we improve the English scores by 3% having a F-measure of 74%.
Eventually, the system outperforms both MorphoChains and other well-known
unsupervised morphological segmentation systems. The results indicate that
candidate generation plays an important role in such an unsupervised log-linear
model that is learned using contrastive estimation with negative samples.
