A corpus of precise natural textual entailment problems
In this paper, we present a new corpus of entailment problems. This corpus
combines the following characteristics: 1. it is precise (does not leave out
implicit hypotheses) 2. it is based on "real-world" texts (i.e. most of the
premises were written for purposes other than testing textual entailment). 3.
its size is 150. The corpus was constructed by taking problems from the Real
Text Entailment and discovering missing hypotheses using a crowd of experts. We
believe that this corpus constitutes a first step towards wide-coverage testing
of precise natural-language inference systems.
