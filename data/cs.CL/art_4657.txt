Attentive Semantic Role Labeling with Boundary Indicator
The goal of semantic role labeling (SRL) is to discover the
predicate-argument structure of a sentence, which plays a critical role in deep
processing of natural language. This paper introduces simple yet effective
auxiliary tags for dependency-based SRL to enhance a syntax-agnostic model with
multi-hop self-attention. Our syntax-agnostic model achieves competitive
performance with state-of-the-art models on the CoNLL-2009 benchmarks both for
English and Chinese.
