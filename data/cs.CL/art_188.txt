Knowledge Sources for Word Sense Disambiguation
Two kinds of systems have been defined during the long history of WSD:
principled systems that define which knowledge types are useful for WSD, and
robust systems that use the information sources at hand, such as, dictionaries,
light-weight ontologies or hand-tagged corpora. This paper tries to systematize
the relation between desired knowledge types and actual information sources. We
also compare the results for a wide range of algorithms that have been
evaluated on a common test setting in our research group. We hope that this
analysis will help change the shift from systems based on information sources
to systems based on knowledge sources. This study might also shed some light on
semi-automatic acquisition of desired knowledge types from existing resources.
