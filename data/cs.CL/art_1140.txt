Automatic Sarcasm Detection: A Survey
Automatic sarcasm detection is the task of predicting sarcasm in text. This
is a crucial step to sentiment analysis, considering prevalence and challenges
of sarcasm in sentiment-bearing text. Beginning with an approach that used
speech-based features, sarcasm detection has witnessed great interest from the
sentiment analysis community. This paper is the first known compilation of past
work in automatic sarcasm detection. We observe three milestones in the
research so far: semi-supervised pattern extraction to identify implicit
sentiment, use of hashtag-based supervision, and use of context beyond target
text. In this paper, we describe datasets, approaches, trends and issues in
sarcasm detection. We also discuss representative performance values, shared
tasks and pointers to future work, as given in prior works. In terms of
resources that could be useful for understanding state-of-the-art, the survey
presents several useful illustrations - most prominently, a table that
summarizes past papers along different dimensions such as features, annotation
techniques, data forms, etc.
