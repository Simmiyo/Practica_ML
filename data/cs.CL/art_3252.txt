Query-Based Abstractive Summarization Using Neural Networks
In this paper, we present a model for generating summaries of text documents
with respect to a query. This is known as query-based summarization. We adapt
an existing dataset of news article summaries for the task and train a
pointer-generator model using this dataset. The generated summaries are
evaluated by measuring similarity to reference summaries. Our results show that
a neural network summarization model, similar to existing neural network models
for abstractive summarization, can be constructed to make use of queries to
produce targeted summaries.
