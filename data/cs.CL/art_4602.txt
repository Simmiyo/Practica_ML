Crowdsourcing Semantic Label Propagation in Relation Classification
Distant supervision is a popular method for performing relation extraction
from text that is known to produce noisy labels. Most progress in relation
extraction and classification has been made with crowdsourced corrections to
distant-supervised labels, and there is evidence that indicates still more
would be better. In this paper, we explore the problem of propagating human
annotation signals gathered for open-domain relation classification through the
CrowdTruth methodology for crowdsourcing, that captures ambiguity in
annotations by measuring inter-annotator disagreement. Our approach propagates
annotations to sentences that are similar in a low dimensional embedding space,
expanding the number of labels by two orders of magnitude. Our experiments show
significant improvement in a sentence-level multi-class relation classifier.
