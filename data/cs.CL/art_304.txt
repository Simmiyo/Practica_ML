Challenging the principle of compositionality in interpreting natural
  language texts
The paper aims at emphasizing that, even relaxed, the hypothesis of
compositionality has to face many problems when used for interpreting natural
language texts. Rather than fixing these problems within the compositional
framework, we believe that a more radical change is necessary, and propose
another approach.
