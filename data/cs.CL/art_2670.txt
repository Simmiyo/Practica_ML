The Importance of Automatic Syntactic Features in Vietnamese Named
  Entity Recognition
This paper presents a state-of-the-art system for Vietnamese Named Entity
Recognition (NER). By incorporating automatic syntactic features with word
embeddings as input for bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), our
system, although simpler than some deep learning architectures, achieves a much
better result for Vietnamese NER. The proposed method achieves an overall F1
score of 92.05% on the test set of an evaluation campaign, organized in late
2016 by the Vietnamese Language and Speech Processing (VLSP) community. Our
named entity recognition system outperforms the best previous systems for
Vietnamese NER by a large margin.
