Mining Compatible/Incompatible Entities from Question and Answering via
  Yes/No Answer Classification using Distant Label Expansion
Product Community Question Answering (PCQA) provides useful information about
products and their features (aspects) that may not be well addressed by product
descriptions and reviews. We observe that a product's compatibility issues with
other products are frequently discussed in PCQA and such issues are more
frequently addressed in accessories, i.e., via a yes/no question "Does this
mouse work with windows 10?". In this paper, we address the problem of
extracting compatible and incompatible products from yes/no questions in PCQA.
This problem can naturally have a two-stage framework: first, we perform
Complementary Entity (product) Recognition (CER) on yes/no questions; second,
we identify the polarities of yes/no answers to assign the complementary
entities a compatibility label (compatible, incompatible or unknown). We
leverage an existing unsupervised method for the first stage and a 3-class
classifier by combining a distant PU-learning method (learning from positive
and unlabeled examples) together with a binary classifier for the second stage.
The benefit of using distant PU-learning is that it can help to expand more
implicit yes/no answers without using any human annotated data. We conduct
experiments on 4 products to show that the proposed method is effective.
