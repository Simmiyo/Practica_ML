Evaluating Word Embeddings for Sentence Boundary Detection in Speech
  Transcripts
This paper is motivated by the automation of neuropsychological tests
involving discourse analysis in the retellings of narratives by patients with
potential cognitive impairment. In this scenario the task of sentence boundary
detection in speech transcripts is important as discourse analysis involves the
application of Natural Language Processing tools, such as taggers and parsers,
which depend on the sentence as a processing unit. Our aim in this paper is to
verify which embedding induction method works best for the sentence boundary
detection task, specifically whether it be those which were proposed to capture
semantic, syntactic or morphological similarities.
