Recurrent Neural Network based Part-of-Speech Tagger for Code-Mixed
  Social Media Text
This paper describes Centre for Development of Advanced Computing's (CDACM)
submission to the shared task-'Tool Contest on POS tagging for Code-Mixed
Indian Social Media (Facebook, Twitter, and Whatsapp) Text', collocated with
ICON-2016. The shared task was to predict Part of Speech (POS) tag at word
level for a given text. The code-mixed text is generated mostly on social media
by multilingual users. The presence of the multilingual words,
transliterations, and spelling variations make such content linguistically
complex. In this paper, we propose an approach to POS tag code-mixed social
media text using Recurrent Neural Network Language Model (RNN-LM) architecture.
We submitted the results for Hindi-English (hi-en), Bengali-English (bn-en),
and Telugu-English (te-en) code-mixed data.
