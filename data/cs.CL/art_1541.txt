Neural Skill Transfer from Supervised Language Tasks to Reading
  Comprehension
Reading comprehension is a challenging task in natural language processing
and requires a set of skills to be solved. While current approaches focus on
solving the task as a whole, in this paper, we propose to use a neural network
`skill' transfer approach. We transfer knowledge from several lower-level
language tasks (skills) including textual entailment, named entity recognition,
paraphrase detection and question type classification into the reading
comprehension model.
  We conduct an empirical evaluation and show that transferring language skill
knowledge leads to significant improvements for the task with much fewer steps
compared to the baseline model. We also show that the skill transfer approach
is effective even with small amounts of training data. Another finding of this
work is that using token-wise deep label supervision for text classification
improves the performance of transfer learning.
