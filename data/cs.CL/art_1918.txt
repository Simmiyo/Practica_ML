Full-Time Supervision based Bidirectional RNN for Factoid Question
  Answering
Recently, bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) has been widely used
for question answering (QA) tasks with promising performance. However, most
existing BRNN models extract the information of questions and answers by
directly using a pooling operation to generate the representation for loss or
similarity calculation. Hence, these existing models don't put supervision
(loss or similarity calculation) at every time step, which will lose some
useful information. In this paper, we propose a novel BRNN model called
full-time supervision based BRNN (FTS-BRNN), which can put supervision at every
time step. Experiments on the factoid QA task show that our FTS-BRNN can
outperform other baselines to achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy.
