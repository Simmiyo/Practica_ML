Incorporating Relevant Knowledge in Context Modeling and Response
  Generation
To sustain engaging conversation, it is critical for chatbots to make good
use of relevant knowledge. Equipped with a knowledge base, chatbots are able to
extract conversation-related attributes and entities to facilitate context
modeling and response generation. In this work, we distinguish the uses of
attribute and entity and incorporate them into the encoder-decoder architecture
in different manners. Based on the augmented architecture, our chatbot, namely
Mike, is able to generate responses by referring to proper entities from the
collected knowledge. To validate the proposed approach, we build a movie
conversation corpus on which the proposed approach significantly outperforms
other four knowledge-grounded models.
