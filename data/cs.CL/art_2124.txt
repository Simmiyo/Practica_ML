A Factorized Model for Transitive Verbs in Compositional Distributional
  Semantics
We present a factorized compositional distributional semantics model for the
representation of transitive verb constructions. Our model first produces
(subject, verb) and (verb, object) vector representations based on the
similarity of the nouns in the construction to each of the nouns in the
vocabulary and the tendency of these nouns to take the subject and object roles
of the verb. These vectors are then combined into a final (subject,verb,object)
representation through simple vector operations. On two established tasks for
the transitive verb construction our model outperforms recent previous work.
