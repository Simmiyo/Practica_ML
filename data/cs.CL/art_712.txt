Unsupervised Methods for Determining Object and Relation Synonyms on the
  Web
The task of identifying synonymous relations and objects, or synonym
resolution, is critical for high-quality information extraction. This paper
investigates synonym resolution in the context of unsupervised information
extraction, where neither hand-tagged training examples nor domain knowledge is
available. The paper presents a scalable, fully-implemented system that runs in
O(KN log N) time in the number of extractions, N, and the maximum number of
synonyms per word, K. The system, called Resolver, introduces a probabilistic
relational model for predicting whether two strings are co-referential based on
the similarity of the assertions containing them. On a set of two million
assertions extracted from the Web, Resolver resolves objects with 78% precision
and 68% recall, and resolves relations with 90% precision and 35% recall.
Several variations of resolvers probabilistic model are explored, and
experiments demonstrate that under appropriate conditions these variations can
improve F1 by 5%. An extension to the basic Resolver system allows it to handle
polysemous names with 97% precision and 95% recall on a data set from the TREC
corpus.
