OpenNMT: Open-source Toolkit for Neural Machine Translation
We introduce an open-source toolkit for neural machine translation (NMT) to
support research into model architectures, feature representations, and source
modalities, while maintaining competitive performance, modularity and
reasonable training requirements.
