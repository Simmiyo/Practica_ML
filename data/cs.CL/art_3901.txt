Content-based Popularity Prediction of Online Petitions Using a Deep
  Regression Model
Online petitions are a cost-effective way for citizens to collectively engage
with policy-makers in a democracy. Predicting the popularity of a petition ---
commonly measured by its signature count --- based on its textual content has
utility for policy-makers as well as those posting the petition. In this work,
we model this task using CNN regression with an auxiliary ordinal regression
objective. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach using UK
and US government petition datasets.
