Machine Translation in Indian Languages: Challenges and Resolution
English to Indian language machine translation poses the challenge of
structural and morphological divergence. This paper describes English to Indian
language statistical machine translation using pre-ordering and suffix
separation. The pre-ordering uses rules to transfer the structure of the source
sentences prior to training and translation. This syntactic restructuring helps
statistical machine translation to tackle the structural divergence and hence
better translation quality. The suffix separation is used to tackle the
morphological divergence between English and highly agglutinative Indian
languages. We demonstrate that the use of pre-ordering and suffix separation
helps in improving the quality of English to Indian Language machine
translation.
