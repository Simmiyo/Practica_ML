Character-level Chinese-English Translation through ASCII Encoding
Character-level Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models have recently
achieved impressive results on many language pairs. They mainly do well for
Indo-European language pairs, where the languages share the same writing
system. However, for translating between Chinese and English, the gap between
the two different writing systems poses a major challenge because of a lack of
systematic correspondence between the individual linguistic units. In this
paper, we enable character-level NMT for Chinese, by breaking down Chinese
characters into linguistic units similar to that of Indo-European languages. We
use the Wubi encoding scheme, which preserves the original shape and semantic
information of the characters, while also being reversible. We show promising
results from training Wubi-based models on the character- and subword-level
with recurrent as well as convolutional models.
