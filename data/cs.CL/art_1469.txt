Stance Detection in Turkish Tweets
Stance detection is a classification problem in natural language processing
where for a text and target pair, a class result from the set {Favor, Against,
Neither} is expected. It is similar to the sentiment analysis problem but
instead of the sentiment of the text author, the stance expressed for a
particular target is investigated in stance detection. In this paper, we
present a stance detection tweet data set for Turkish comprising stance
annotations of these tweets for two popular sports clubs as targets.
Additionally, we provide the evaluation results of SVM classifiers for each
target on this data set, where the classifiers use unigram, bigram, and hashtag
features. This study is significant as it presents one of the initial stance
detection data sets proposed so far and the first one for Turkish language, to
the best of our knowledge. The data set and the evaluation results of the
corresponding SVM-based approaches will form plausible baselines for the
comparison of future studies on stance detection.
