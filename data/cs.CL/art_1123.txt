Agreement-based Joint Training for Bidirectional Attention-based Neural
  Machine Translation
The attentional mechanism has proven to be effective in improving end-to-end
neural machine translation. However, due to the intricate structural divergence
between natural languages, unidirectional attention-based models might only
capture partial aspects of attentional regularities. We propose agreement-based
joint training for bidirectional attention-based end-to-end neural machine
translation. Instead of training source-to-target and target-to-source
translation models independently,our approach encourages the two complementary
models to agree on word alignment matrices on the same training data.
Experiments on Chinese-English and English-French translation tasks show that
agreement-based joint training significantly improves both alignment and
translation quality over independent training.
