Are Style Guides Controlled Languages? The Case of Koenig & Bauer AG
Controlled natural languages for industrial application are often regarded as
a response to the challenges of translation and multilingual communication.
This paper presents a quite different approach taken by Koenig & Bauer AG,
where the main goal was the improvement of the authoring process for technical
documentation. Most importantly, this paper explores the notion of a controlled
language and demonstrates how style guides can emerge from non-linguistic
considerations. Moreover, it shows the transition from loose language
recommendations into precise and prescriptive rules and investigates whether
such rules can be regarded as a full-fledged controlled language.
