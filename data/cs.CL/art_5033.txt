CIS at TAC Cold Start 2015: Neural Networks and Coreference Resolution
  for Slot Filling
This paper describes the CIS slot filling system for the TAC Cold Start
evaluations 2015. It extends and improves the system we have built for the
evaluation last year. This paper mainly describes the changes to our last
year's system. Especially, it focuses on the coreference and classification
component. For coreference, we have performed several analysis and prepared a
resource to simplify our end-to-end system and improve its runtime. For
classification, we propose to use neural networks. We have trained
convolutional and recurrent neural networks and combined them with traditional
evaluation methods, namely patterns and support vector machines. Our runs for
the 2015 evaluation have been designed to directly assess the effect of each
network on the end-to-end performance of the system. The CIS system achieved
rank 3 of all slot filling systems participating in the task.
