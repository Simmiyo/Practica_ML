Summarizing Encyclopedic Term Descriptions on the Web
We are developing an automatic method to compile an encyclopedic corpus from
the Web. In our previous work, paragraph-style descriptions for a term are
extracted from Web pages and organized based on domains. However, these
descriptions are independent and do not comprise a condensed text as in
hand-crafted encyclopedias. To resolve this problem, we propose a summarization
method, which produces a single text from multiple descriptions. The resultant
summary concisely describes a term from different viewpoints. We also show the
effectiveness of our method by means of experiments.
