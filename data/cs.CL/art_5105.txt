Streaming End-to-end Speech Recognition For Mobile Devices
End-to-end (E2E) models, which directly predict output character sequences
given input speech, are good candidates for on-device speech recognition. E2E
models, however, present numerous challenges: In order to be truly useful, such
models must decode speech utterances in a streaming fashion, in real time; they
must be robust to the long tail of use cases; they must be able to leverage
user-specific context (e.g., contact lists); and above all, they must be
extremely accurate. In this work, we describe our efforts at building an E2E
speech recognizer using a recurrent neural network transducer. In experimental
evaluations, we find that the proposed approach can outperform a conventional
CTC-based model in terms of both latency and accuracy in a number of evaluation
categories.
