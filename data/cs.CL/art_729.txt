Event Structure of Transitive Verb: A MARVS perspective
Module-Attribute Representation of Verbal Semantics (MARVS) is a theory of
the representation of verbal semantics that is based on Mandarin Chinese data
(Huang et al. 2000). In the MARVS theory, there are two different types of
modules: Event Structure Modules and Role Modules. There are also two sets of
attributes: Event-Internal Attributes and Role-Internal Attributes, which are
linked to the Event Structure Module and the Role Module, respectively. In this
study, we focus on four transitive verbs as chi1(eat), wan2(play),
huan4(change) and shao1(burn) and explore their event structures by the MARVS
theory.
