Method for Aspect-Based Sentiment Annotation Using Rhetorical Analysis
This paper fills a gap in aspect-based sentiment analysis and aims to present
a new method for preparing and analysing texts concerning opinion and
generating user-friendly descriptive reports in natural language. We present a
comprehensive set of techniques derived from Rhetorical Structure Theory and
sentiment analysis to extract aspects from textual opinions and then build an
abstractive summary of a set of opinions. Moreover, we propose aspect-aspect
graphs to evaluate the importance of aspects and to filter out unimportant ones
from the summary. Additionally, the paper presents a prototype solution of data
flow with interesting and valuable results. The proposed method's results
proved the high accuracy of aspect detection when applied to the gold standard
dataset.
