Massively Increasing TIMEX3 Resources: A Transduction Approach
Automatic annotation of temporal expressions is a research challenge of great
interest in the field of information extraction. Gold standard
temporally-annotated resources are limited in size, which makes research using
them difficult. Standards have also evolved over the past decade, so not all
temporally annotated data is in the same format. We vastly increase available
human-annotated temporal expression resources by converting older format
resources to TimeML/TIMEX3. This task is difficult due to differing annotation
methods. We present a robust conversion tool and a new, large temporal
expression resource. Using this, we evaluate our conversion process by using it
as training data for an existing TimeML annotation tool, achieving a 0.87 F1
measure -- better than any system in the TempEval-2 timex recognition exercise.
