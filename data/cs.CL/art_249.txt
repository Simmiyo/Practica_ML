An Approach for Resource Sharing in Multilingual NLP
In this paper we describe an approach for the analysis of documents in German
and English with a shared pool of resources. For the analysis of German
documents we use a document suite, which supports the user in tasks like
information retrieval and information extraction. The core of the document
suite is based on our tool XDOC. Now we want to exploit these methods for the
analysis of English documents as well. For this aim we need a multilingual
presentation format of the resources. These resources must be transformed into
an unified format, in which we can set additional information about linguistic
characteristics of the language depending on the analyzed documents. In this
paper we describe our approach for such an exchange model for multilingual
resources based on XML.
