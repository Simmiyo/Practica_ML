Hindi-English Code-Switching Speech Corpus
Code-switching refers to the usage of two languages within a sentence or
discourse. It is a global phenomenon among multilingual communities and has
emerged as an independent area of research. With the increasing demand for the
code-switching automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, the development of a
code-switching speech corpus has become highly desirable. However, for training
such systems, very limited code-switched resources are available as yet. In
this work, we present our first efforts in building a code-switching ASR system
in the Indian context. For that purpose, we have created a Hindi-English
code-switching speech database. The database not only contains the speech
utterances with code-switching properties but also covers the session and the
speaker variations like pronunciation, accent, age, gender, etc. This database
can be applied in several speech signal processing applications, such as
code-switching ASR, language identification, language modeling, speech
synthesis etc. This paper mainly presents an analysis of the statistics of the
collected code-switching speech corpus. Later, the performance results for the
ASR task have been reported for the created database.
