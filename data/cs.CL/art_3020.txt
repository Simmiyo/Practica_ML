Combining Search with Structured Data to Create a More Engaging User
  Experience in Open Domain Dialogue
The greatest challenges in building sophisticated open-domain conversational
agents arise directly from the potential for ongoing mixed-initiative
multi-turn dialogues, which do not follow a particular plan or pursue a
particular fixed information need. In order to make coherent conversational
contributions in this context, a conversational agent must be able to track the
types and attributes of the entities under discussion in the conversation and
know how they are related. In some cases, the agent can rely on structured
information sources to help identify the relevant semantic relations and
produce a turn, but in other cases, the only content available comes from
search, and it may be unclear which semantic relations hold between the search
results and the discourse context. A further constraint is that the system must
produce its contribution to the ongoing conversation in real-time. This paper
describes our experience building SlugBot for the 2017 Alexa Prize, and
discusses how we leveraged search and structured data from different sources to
help SlugBot produce dialogic turns and carry on conversations whose length
over the semi-finals user evaluation period averaged 8:17 minutes.
