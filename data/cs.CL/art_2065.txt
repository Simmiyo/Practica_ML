Aligning Packed Dependency Trees: a theory of composition for
  distributional semantics
We present a new framework for compositional distributional semantics in
which the distributional contexts of lexemes are expressed in terms of anchored
packed dependency trees. We show that these structures have the potential to
capture the full sentential contexts of a lexeme and provide a uniform basis
for the composition of distributional knowledge in a way that captures both
mutual disambiguation and generalization.
