A Chart-Parsing Algorithm for Efficient Semantic Analysis
In some contexts, well-formed natural language cannot be expected as input to
information or communication systems. In these contexts, the use of
grammar-independent input (sequences of uninflected semantic units like e.g.
language-independent icons) can be an answer to the users' needs. A semantic
analysis can be performed, based on lexical semantic knowledge: it is
equivalent to a dependency analysis with no syntactic or morphological clues.
However, this requires that an intelligent system should be able to interpret
this input with reasonable accuracy and in reasonable time. Here we propose a
method allowing a purely semantic-based analysis of sequences of semantic
units. It uses an algorithm inspired by the idea of ``chart parsing'' known in
Natural Language Processing, which stores intermediate parsing results in order
to bring the calculation time down. In comparison with using declarative logic
programming - where the calculation time, left to a prolog engine, is
hyperexponential -, this method brings the calculation time down to a
polynomial time, where the order depends on the valency of the predicates.
