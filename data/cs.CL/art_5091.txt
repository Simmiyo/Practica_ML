Cross-lingual Short-text Matching with Deep Learning
The problem of short text matching is formulated as follows: given a pair of
sentences or questions, a matching model determines whether the input pair mean
the same or not. Models that can automatically identify questions with the same
meaning have a wide range of applications in question answering sites and
modern chatbots. In this article, we describe the approach by team hahu to
solve this problem in the context of the "CIKM AnalytiCup 2018 - Cross-lingual
Short-text Matching of Question Pairs" that is sponsored by Alibaba. Our
solution is an end-to-end system based on current advances in deep learning
which avoids heavy feature-engineering and achieves improved performance over
traditional machine-learning approaches. The log-loss scores for the first and
second rounds of the contest are 0.35 and 0.39 respectively. The team was
ranked 7th from 1027 teams in the overall ranking scheme by the organizers that
consisted of the two contest scores as well as: innovation and system
integrity, understanding data as well as practicality of the solution for
business.
