Comparing Human and Machine Errors in Conversational Speech
  Transcription
Recent work in automatic recognition of conversational telephone speech (CTS)
has achieved accuracy levels comparable to human transcribers, although there
is some debate how to precisely quantify human performance on this task, using
the NIST 2000 CTS evaluation set. This raises the question what systematic
differences, if any, may be found differentiating human from machine
transcription errors. In this paper we approach this question by comparing the
output of our most accurate CTS recognition system to that of a standard speech
transcription vendor pipeline. We find that the most frequent substitution,
deletion and insertion error types of both outputs show a high degree of
overlap. The only notable exception is that the automatic recognizer tends to
confuse filled pauses ("uh") and backchannel acknowledgments ("uhhuh"). Humans
tend not to make this error, presumably due to the distinctive and opposing
pragmatic functions attached to these words. Furthermore, we quantify the
correlation between human and machine errors at the speaker level, and
investigate the effect of speaker overlap between training and test data.
Finally, we report on an informal "Turing test" asking humans to discriminate
between automatic and human transcription error cases.
