It's distributions all the way down!: Second order changes in
  statistical distributions also occur
The textual, big-data literature misses Bentley, OBrien, & Brocks (Bentley et
als) message on distributions; it largely examines the first-order effects of
how a single, signature distribution can predict population behaviour,
neglecting second-order effects involving distributional shifts, either between
signature distributions or within a given signature distribution. Indeed,
Bentley et al. themselves under-emphasise the potential richness of the latter,
within-distribution effects.
