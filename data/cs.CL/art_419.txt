SLAM : Solutions lexicales automatique pour métaphores
This article presents SLAM, an Automatic Solver for Lexical Metaphors like
?d\'eshabiller* une pomme? (to undress* an apple). SLAM calculates a
conventional solution for these productions. To carry on it, SLAM has to
intersect the paradigmatic axis of the metaphorical verb ?d\'eshabiller*?,
where ?peler? (?to peel?) comes closer, with a syntagmatic axis that comes from
a corpus where ?peler une pomme? (to peel an apple) is semantically and
syntactically regular. We test this model on DicoSyn, which is a ?small world?
network of synonyms, to compute the paradigmatic axis and on Frantext.20, a
French corpus, to compute the syntagmatic axis. Further, we evaluate the model
with a sample of an experimental corpus of the database of Flexsem
