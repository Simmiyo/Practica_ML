Toward Automatic Understanding of the Function of Affective Language in
  Support Groups
Understanding expressions of emotions in support forums has considerable
value and NLP methods are key to automating this. Many approaches
understandably use subjective categories which are more fine-grained than a
straightforward polarity-based spectrum. However, the definition of such
categories is non-trivial and, in fact, we argue for a need to incorporate
communicative elements even beyond subjectivity. To support our position, we
report experiments on a sentiment-labelled corpus of posts taken from a medical
support forum. We argue that not only is a more fine-grained approach to text
analysis important, but simultaneously recognising the social function behind
affective expressions enable a more accurate and valuable level of
understanding.
