Chart Parsing Multimodal Grammars
The short note describes the chart parser for multimodal type-logical
grammars which has been developed in conjunction with the type-logical treebank
for French. The chart parser presents an incomplete but fast implementation of
proof search for multimodal type-logical grammars using the "deductive parsing"
framework. Proofs found can be transformed to natural deduction proofs.
