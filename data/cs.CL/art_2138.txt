Psychologically Motivated Text Mining
Natural language processing techniques are increasingly applied to identify
social trends and predict behavior based on large text collections. Existing
methods typically rely on surface lexical and syntactic information. Yet,
research in psychology shows that patterns of human conceptualisation, such as
metaphorical framing, are reliable predictors of human expectations and
decisions. In this paper, we present a method to learn patterns of metaphorical
framing from large text collections, using statistical techniques. We apply the
method to data in three different languages and evaluate the identified
patterns, demonstrating their psychological validity.
