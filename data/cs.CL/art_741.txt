Generating Music from Literature
We present a system, TransProse, that automatically generates musical pieces
from text. TransProse uses known relations between elements of music such as
tempo and scale, and the emotions they evoke. Further, it uses a novel
mechanism to determine sequences of notes that capture the emotional activity
in the text. The work has applications in information visualization, in
creating audio-visual e-books, and in developing music apps.
