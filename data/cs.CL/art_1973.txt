Syntactic Phylogenetic Trees
In this paper we identify several serious problems that arise in the use of
syntactic data from the SSWL database for the purpose of computational
phylogenetic reconstruction. We show that the most naive approach fails to
produce reliable linguistic phylogenetic trees. We identify some of the sources
of the observed problems and we discuss how they may be, at least partly,
corrected by using additional information, such as prior subdivision into
language families and subfamilies, and a better use of the information about
ancient languages. We also describe how the use of phylogenetic algebraic
geometry can help in estimating to what extent the probability distribution at
the leaves of the phylogenetic tree obtained from the SSWL data can be
considered reliable, by testing it on phylogenetic trees established by other
forms of linguistic analysis. In simple examples, we find that, after
restricting to smaller language subfamilies and considering only those SSWL
parameters that are fully mapped for the whole subfamily, the SSWL data match
extremely well reliable phylogenetic trees, according to the evaluation of
phylogenetic invariants. This is a promising sign for the use of SSWL data for
linguistic phylogenetics.
