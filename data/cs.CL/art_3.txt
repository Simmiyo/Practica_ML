A Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar for English
This document describes a sizable grammar of English written in the TAG
formalism and implemented for use with the XTAG system. This report and the
grammar described herein supersedes the TAG grammar described in an earlier
1995 XTAG technical report. The English grammar described in this report is
based on the TAG formalism which has been extended to include lexicalization,
and unification-based feature structures. The range of syntactic phenomena that
can be handled is large and includes auxiliaries (including inversion), copula,
raising and small clause constructions, topicalization, relative clauses,
infinitives, gerunds, passives, adjuncts, it-clefts, wh-clefts, PRO
constructions, noun-noun modifications, extraposition, determiner sequences,
genitives, negation, noun-verb contractions, sentential adjuncts and
imperatives. This technical report corresponds to the XTAG Release 8/31/98. The
XTAG grammar is continuously updated with the addition of new analyses and
modification of old ones, and an online version of this report can be found at
the XTAG web page at http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~xtag/
