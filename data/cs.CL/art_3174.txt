A First Step in Combining Cognitive Event Features and Natural Language
  Representations to Predict Emotions
We explore the representational space of emotions by combining methods from
different academic fields. Cognitive science has proposed appraisal theory as a
view on human emotion with previous research showing how human-rated abstract
event features can predict fine-grained emotions and capture the similarity
space of neural patterns in mentalizing brain regions. At the same time,
natural language processing (NLP) has demonstrated how transfer and multitask
learning can be used to cope with scarcity of annotated data for text modeling.
  The contribution of this work is to show that appraisal theory can be
combined with NLP for mutual benefit. First, fine-grained emotion prediction
can be improved to human-level performance by using NLP representations in
addition to appraisal features. Second, using the appraisal features as
auxiliary targets during training can improve predictions even when only text
is available as input. Third, we obtain a representation with a similarity
matrix that better correlates with the neural activity across regions. Best
results are achieved when the model is trained to simultaneously predict
appraisals, emotions and emojis using a shared representation.
  While these results are preliminary, the integration of cognitive
neuroscience and NLP techniques opens up an interesting direction for future
research.
