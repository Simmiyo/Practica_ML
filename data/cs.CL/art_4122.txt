Humor Detection in English-Hindi Code-Mixed Social Media Content :
  Corpus and Baseline System
The tremendous amount of user generated data through social networking sites
led to the gaining popularity of automatic text classification in the field of
computational linguistics over the past decade. Within this domain, one problem
that has drawn the attention of many researchers is automatic humor detection
in texts. In depth semantic understanding of the text is required to detect
humor which makes the problem difficult to automate. With increase in the
number of social media users, many multilingual speakers often interchange
between languages while posting on social media which is called code-mixing. It
introduces some challenges in the field of linguistic analysis of social media
content (Barman et al., 2014), like spelling variations and non-grammatical
structures in a sentence. Past researches include detecting puns in texts (Kao
et al., 2016) and humor in one-lines (Mihalcea et al., 2010) in a single
language, but with the tremendous amount of code-mixed data available online,
there is a need to develop techniques which detects humor in code-mixed tweets.
In this paper, we analyze the task of humor detection in texts and describe a
freely available corpus containing English-Hindi code-mixed tweets annotated
with humorous(H) or non-humorous(N) tags. We also tagged the words in the
tweets with Language tags (English/Hindi/Others). Moreover, we describe the
experiments carried out on the corpus and provide a baseline classification
system which distinguishes between humorous and non-humorous texts.
