Blind Normalization of Speech From Different Channels and Speakers
This paper describes representations of time-dependent signals that are
invariant under any invertible time-independent transformation of the signal
time series. Such a representation is created by rescaling the signal in a
non-linear dynamic manner that is determined by recently encountered signal
levels. This technique may make it possible to normalize signals that are
related by channel-dependent and speaker-dependent transformations, without
having to characterize the form of the signal transformations, which remain
unknown. The technique is illustrated by applying it to the time-dependent
spectra of speech that has been filtered to simulate the effects of different
channels. The experimental results show that the rescaled speech
representations are largely normalized (i.e., channel-independent), despite the
channel-dependence of the raw (unrescaled) speech.
