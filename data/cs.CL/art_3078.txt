Symbol, Conversational, and Societal Grounding with a Toy Robot
Essential to meaningful interaction is grounding at the symbolic,

toy robot as a research platform where we leverage the recent
words-as-classifiers model of lexical semantics in interactive reference
resolution tasks for language grounding.
