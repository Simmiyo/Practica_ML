A State-of-the-Art of Semantic Change Computation
This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of semantic change computation, one
emerging research field in computational linguistics, proposing a framework
that summarizes the literature by identifying and expounding five essential
components in the field: diachronic corpus, diachronic word sense
characterization, change modelling, evaluation data and data visualization.
Despite the potential of the field, the review shows that current studies are
mainly focused on testifying hypotheses proposed in theoretical linguistics and
that several core issues remain to be solved: the need for diachronic corpora
of languages other than English, the need for comprehensive evaluation data for
evaluation, the comparison and construction of approaches to diachronic word
sense characterization and change modelling, and further exploration of data
visualization techniques for hypothesis justification.
