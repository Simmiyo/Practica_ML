Bunsetsu Identification Using Category-Exclusive Rules
This paper describes two new bunsetsu identification methods using supervised
learning. Since Japanese syntactic analysis is usually done after bunsetsu
identification, bunsetsu identification is important for analyzing Japanese
sentences. In experiments comparing the four previously available
machine-learning methods (decision tree, maximum-entropy method, example-based
approach and decision list) and two new methods using category-exclusive rules,
the new method using the category-exclusive rules with the highest similarity
performed best.
