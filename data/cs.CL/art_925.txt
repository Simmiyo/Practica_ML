A Knowledge-poor Pronoun Resolution System for Turkish
A pronoun resolution system which requires limited syntactic knowledge to
identify the antecedents of personal and reflexive pronouns in Turkish is
presented. As in its counterparts for languages like English, Spanish and
French, the core of the system is the constraints and preferences determined
empirically. In the evaluation phase, it performed considerably better than the
baseline algorithm used for comparison. The system is significant for its being
the first fully specified knowledge-poor computational framework for pronoun
resolution in Turkish where Turkish possesses different structural properties
from the languages for which knowledge-poor systems had been developed.
