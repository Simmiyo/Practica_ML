Morphological Analysis of the Bishnupriya Manipuri Language using Finite
  State Transducers
In this work we present a morphological analysis of Bishnupriya Manipuri
language, an Indo-Aryan language spoken in the north eastern India. As of now,
there is no computational work available for the language. Finite state
morphology is one of the successful approaches applied in a wide variety of
languages over the year. Therefore we adapted the finite state approach to
analyse morphology of the Bishnupriya Manipuri language.
