What can linguistics and deep learning contribute to each other?
Joe Pater's target article calls for greater interaction between neural
network research and linguistics. I expand on this call and show how such
interaction can benefit both fields. Linguists can contribute to research on
neural networks for language technologies by clearly delineating the linguistic
capabilities that can be expected of such systems, and by constructing
controlled experimental paradigms that can determine whether those desiderata
have been met. In the other direction, neural networks can benefit the
scientific study of language by providing infrastructure for modeling human
sentence processing and for evaluating the necessity of particular innate
constraints on language acquisition.
