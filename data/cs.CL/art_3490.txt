SentEval: An Evaluation Toolkit for Universal Sentence Representations
We introduce SentEval, a toolkit for evaluating the quality of universal
sentence representations. SentEval encompasses a variety of tasks, including
binary and multi-class classification, natural language inference and sentence
similarity. The set of tasks was selected based on what appears to be the
community consensus regarding the appropriate evaluations for universal
sentence representations. The toolkit comes with scripts to download and
preprocess datasets, and an easy interface to evaluate sentence encoders. The
aim is to provide a fairer, less cumbersome and more centralized way for
evaluating sentence representations.
