The Interplay between Lexical Resources and Natural Language Processing
Incorporating linguistic, world and common sense knowledge into AI/NLP
systems is currently an important research area, with several open problems and
challenges. At the same time, processing and storing this knowledge in lexical
resources is not a straightforward task. This tutorial proposes to address
these complementary goals from two methodological perspectives: the use of NLP
methods to help the process of constructing and enriching lexical resources and
the use of lexical resources for improving NLP applications. Two main types of
audience can benefit from this tutorial: those working on language resources
who are interested in becoming acquainted with automatic NLP techniques, with
the end goal of speeding and/or easing up the process of resource curation; and
on the other hand, researchers in NLP who would like to benefit from the
knowledge of lexical resources to improve their systems and models. The slides
of the tutorial are available at https://bitbucket.org/luisespinosa/lr-nlp/
