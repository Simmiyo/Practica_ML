Proceedings of the LexSem+Logics Workshop 2016
Lexical semantics continues to play an important role in driving research
directions in NLP, with the recognition and understanding of context becoming
increasingly important in delivering successful outcomes in NLP tasks. Besides
traditional processing areas such as word sense and named entity
disambiguation, the creation and maintenance of dictionaries, annotated corpora
and resources have become cornerstones of lexical semantics research and
produced a wealth of contextual information that NLP processes can exploit. New
efforts both to link and construct from scratch such information - as Linked
Open Data or by way of formal tools coming from logic, ontologies and automated
reasoning - have increased the interoperability and accessibility of resources
for lexical and computational semantics, even in those languages for which they
have previously been limited.
  LexSem+Logics 2016 combines the 1st Workshop on Lexical Semantics for
Lesser-Resources Languages and the 3rd Workshop on Logics and Ontologies. The
accepted papers in our program covered topics across these two areas,
including: the encoding of plurals in Wordnets, the creation of a thesaurus
from multiple sources based on semantic similarity metrics, and the use of
cross-lingual treebanks and annotations for universal part-of-speech tagging.
We also welcomed talks from two distinguished speakers: on Portuguese lexical
knowledge bases (different approaches, results and their application in NLP
tasks) and on new strategies for open information extraction (the capture of
verb-based propositions from massive text corpora).
