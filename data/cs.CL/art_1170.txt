Parallel Texts in the Hebrew Bible, New Methods and Visualizations
In this article we develop an algorithm to detect parallel texts in the
Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible. The results are presented online and
chapters in the Hebrew Bible containing parallel passages can be inspected
synoptically. Differences between parallel passages are highlighted. In a
similar way the MT of Isaiah is presented synoptically with 1QIsaa. We also
investigate how one can investigate the degree of similarity between parallel
passages with the help of a case study of 2 Kings 19-25 and its parallels in
Isaiah, Jeremiah and 2 Chronicles.
