Resources for Evaluation of Summarization Techniques
We report on two corpora to be used in the evaluation of component systems
for the tasks of (1) linear segmentation of text and (2) summary-directed
sentence extraction. We present characteristics of the corpora, methods used in
the collection of user judgments, and an overview of the application of the
corpora to evaluating the component system. Finally, we discuss the problems
and issues with construction of the test set which apply broadly to the
construction of evaluation resources for language technologies.
