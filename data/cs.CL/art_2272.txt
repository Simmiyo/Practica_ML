Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Conditional Random Fields For Spoken
  Language Understanding Using Unaligned Data
We experiment graph-based Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) of Conditional
Random Fields (CRF) for the application of Spoken Language Understanding (SLU)
on unaligned data. The aligned labels for examples are obtained using IBM
Model. We adapt a baseline semi-supervised CRF by defining new feature set and
altering the label propagation algorithm. Our results demonstrate that our
proposed approach significantly improves the performance of the supervised
model by utilizing the knowledge gained from the graph.
