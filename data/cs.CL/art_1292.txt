Content Selection in Data-to-Text Systems: A Survey
Data-to-text systems are powerful in generating reports from data
automatically and thus they simplify the presentation of complex data. Rather
than presenting data using visualisation techniques, data-to-text systems use
natural (human) language, which is the most common way for human-human
communication. In addition, data-to-text systems can adapt their output content
to users' preferences, background or interests and therefore they can be
pleasant for users to interact with. Content selection is an important part of
every data-to-text system, because it is the module that determines which from
the available information should be conveyed to the user. This survey initially
introduces the field of data-to-text generation, describes the general
data-to-text system architecture and then it reviews the state-of-the-art
content selection methods. Finally, it provides recommendations for choosing an
approach and discusses opportunities for future research.
