Composite Semantic Relation Classification
Different semantic interpretation tasks such as text entailment and question
answering require the classification of semantic relations between terms or
entities within text. However, in most cases it is not possible to assign a
direct semantic relation between entities/terms. This paper proposes an
approach for composite semantic relation classification, extending the
traditional semantic relation classification task. Different from existing
approaches, which use machine learning models built over lexical and
distributional word vector features, the proposed model uses the combination of
a large commonsense knowledge base of binary relations, a distributional
navigational algorithm and sequence classification to provide a solution for
the composite semantic relation classification problem.
