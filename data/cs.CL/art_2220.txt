Stance detection in online discussions
This paper describes our system created to detect stance in online
discussions. The goal is to identify whether the author of a comment is in
favor of the given target or against. Our approach is based on a maximum
entropy classifier, which uses surface-level, sentiment and domain-specific
features. The system was originally developed to detect stance in English
tweets. We adapted it to process Czech news commentaries.
