Temporal Expressions in Japanese-to-English Machine Translation
This paper describes in outline a method for translating Japanese temporal
expressions into English. We argue that temporal expressions form a special
subset of language that is best handled as a special module in machine
translation. The paper deals with problems of lexical idiosyncrasy as well as
the choice of articles and prepositions within temporal expressions. In
addition temporal expressions are considered as parts of larger structures, and
the question of whether to translate them as noun phrases or adverbials is
addressed.
