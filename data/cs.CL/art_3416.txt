CytonMT: an Efficient Neural Machine Translation Open-source Toolkit
  Implemented in C++
This paper presents an open-source neural machine translation toolkit named
CytonMT (https://github.com/arthurxlw/cytonMt). The toolkit is built from
scratch only using C++ and NVIDIA's GPU-accelerated libraries. The toolkit
features training efficiency, code simplicity and translation quality.
Benchmarks show that CytonMT accelerates the training speed by 64.5% to 110.8%
on neural networks of various sizes, and achieves competitive translation
quality.
