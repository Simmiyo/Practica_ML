Quantifying Scripts: Defining metrics of characters for quantitative and
  descriptive analysis
Analysis of scripts plays an important role in paleography and in
quantitative linguistics. Especially in the field of digital paleography
quantitative features are much needed to differentiate glyphs. We describe an
elaborate set of metrics that quantify qualitative information contained in
characters and hence indirectly also quantify the scribal features. We broadly
divide the metrics into several categories and describe each individual metric
with its underlying qualitative significance. The metrics are largely derived
from the related area of gesture design and recognition. We also propose
several novel metrics. The proposed metrics are soundly grounded on the
principles of handwriting production and handwriting analysis. These computed
metrics could serve as descriptors for scripts and also be used for comparing
and analyzing scripts. We illustrate some quantitative analysis based on the
proposed metrics by applying it to the paleographic evolution of the medieval
Tamil script from Brahmi. We also outline future work.
