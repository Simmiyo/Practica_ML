Anaphora and Coreference Resolution: A Review
Entity resolution aims at resolving repeated references to an entity in a
document and forms a core component of natural language processing (NLP)
research. This field possesses immense potential to improve the performance of
other NLP fields like machine translation, sentiment analysis, paraphrase
detection, summarization, etc. The area of entity resolution in NLP has seen
proliferation of research in two separate sub-areas namely: anaphora resolution
and coreference resolution. Through this review article, we aim at clarifying
the scope of these two tasks in entity resolution. We also carry out a detailed
analysis of the datasets, evaluation metrics and research methods that have
been adopted to tackle this NLP problem. This survey is motivated with the aim
of providing the reader with a clear understanding of what constitutes this NLP
problem and the issues that require attention.
